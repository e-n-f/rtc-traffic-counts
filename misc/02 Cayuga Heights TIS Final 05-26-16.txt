EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

OVERVIEW
The purpose of this report is to identify the potential traffic impacts and parking needs
associated with the proposed Medical Office Building at Corners Community Shopping
Center in the Village of Cayuga Heights, Tompkins County, New York. For traffic impacts,
the operating characteristics of the proposed access points and impacts to the adjacent
roadway network are identified. An analysis of parking demand and supply for the
proposed development is also provided.

In an effort to define traffic impact, this analysis establishes existing traffic conditions,
projects background traffic flow including area growth, and determines the traffic
operations that would result from the proposed development. Future traffic volumes and
operating conditions are then evaluated.

The proposed Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center consists of one
two-story building with approximately 27,600 gross square footage (SF). The proposed
project entails demolishing an existing one-story 3,600 SF office building and a 1,700 SF
one-story bank building. The existing shopping center has multiple points of ingress and
egress: one on Hanshaw Road, one on Pleasant Grove Road, and three on Upland Road
which will continue to be used as access to the shopping center and proposed Medical
Office Building. Proposed site improvements with the construction of the Medical Office
Building close the internal vehicular connection at the south end of the plaza that currently
allows Carriage House apartment residents and any other through traffic from Pleasant
Grove Road to enter or exit the plaza from this southern location as shown in the
accompanying Figures; pedestrian and bicycle connections will remain.

Construction of the proposed development is expected to be completed in 2017. Village
of Cayuga Heights officials were contacted to discuss projects within the study area that
are under construction and/or approved. One project that was approved 10 years ago
was identified but has not shown progress. This proposed subdivision is located on the
vacant land to the south of Corners Community Center and is an 8-lot subdivision which
is anticipated to have single family dwellings on all but two of the lots.

The ambient traffic growth rate was derived by comparing past NYSDOT counts to
current estimated AADT. Current AADT was estimated based upon existing 2016 PM
traffic counts and was compared to NYSDOT Counts at two similar locations in the
project area. These comparisons show little to no annual growth over the last six years.
A growth rate of 0.25% was used to account for background growth and the proposed
subdivision and determine background conditions for the one-year-build-out period
(2017).

The operating characteristics of the study intersections and impacts to the adjacent
roadway network are identified and mitigating measures, if any, are provided to minimize
any capacity or safety concerns.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
This study evaluates the potential traffic and parking impacts resulting from the proposed
Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center. Based upon our comprehensive
analysis, the results indicate that the proposed development will not have significant
adverse traffic or impacts to the existing roadway network or parking impacts to the
existing and proposed conditions. The following sets forth conclusions and
recommendations based upon the results of the analyses:

     1. The proposed Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center is expected
        to generate approximately 52(14) vehicles entering the Corners Community
        Center during the AM(PM) peak hours respectively and 25(66) vehicles exiting the
        Corners Community Center during the AM(PM) peak hours.

     2. The proposed development will not result in any potentially significant adverse
        traffic impacts to the study area intersections.

     3. No mitigation is warranted or recommended at any of the study intersections as
        a result of the proposed Medical Office Building development.

     4. The parking analysis indicates that the proposed parking spaces will be sufficient
        to accommodate parking needs during the majority of the time. During the peak
        month of December there may be times of the day when the parking lots reach
        90% capacity.

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to identify the potential traffic impacts and parking needs
associated with proposed Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center in the
Village of Cayuga Heights, Tompkins County, New York. The operating characteristics of
the proposed access point and impacts to the adjacent roadway network are identified.
An analysis of parking demand and supply for the proposed development is also provided.

In an effort to define traffic impact, this analysis establishes existing traffic conditions,
projects background traffic flow including area growth, and determines the traffic
operations that would result from the proposed developments. Future traffic volumes and
operating conditions are then evaluated.


II. LOCATION

The proposed Medical Office Building is located on the south end of the Corners
Community Center in the Village of Cayuga Heights, Tompkins County, New York. The
site location and study area are shown in Figure 1 – Site Location and Study Area (all
figures are included at the end of this report).

The proposed Medical Office Building is surrounded by adjacent commercial and retail
sites in the Corners Community Center. The Shopping Center is surrounded primarily
by residential development. The study area consists of the following intersections:
     Hanshaw Road/ North Triphammer Road;
     East Upland Road/Triphammer Road/Hanshaw Road;
     three shopping center entrances along East Upland Road identified as North,
        Middle and South;
     one shopping center entrance on Hanshaw Road;
     Pleasant Grove Road/Hanshaw Road;
     one shopping center entrance on Pleasant Grove Road; and
     a driveway connection from the Carriage House Apartment parking lot to the
        south end of the Corners Community Center parking lot, which also allows access
        to Pleasant Grove Road, that will be removed with the construction of the site
        improvements associated with the proposed Medical Office Building project.

The intersection of Pleasant Grove Road with the entrance to the Carriage House
Apartments is not included in the project analysis but existing data was collected at that
location in order to account for the relocation of trips generated by the southern interior
Corners Community Center connection that will be closed by construction of the project.


III. EXISTING HIGHWAY SYSTEM

All roadways in the project area are functionally classified as local roadways, under the
jurisdiction of the Village of Cayuga Heights. Within the study area, motorists travel north
and south or east and west using one travel lane in each direction. According to New
York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) data in 2014 and 2010, Annual

                                                1                                    May 2016
Traffic Impact Study             Proposed Medical Office Building     Village of Cayuga Heights, NY



Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on North Triphammer Road, approximately 1,558 feet
north of Hanshaw Road is 10,743 vehicles per day (vpd) and on Hanshaw Road
approximately 150’ west of Pleasant Grove Road is 8,606 vpd, respectively. Data collected
by SRF & Associates (SRF) in April 2016 indicates that immediately north of Hanshaw
Road on North Triphammer Road the average daily traffic is approximately 10,620 vpd
and on Hanshaw Road west of Pleasant Grove Road is 8,860 vpd. The posted speed limits
on the roadways surrounding Corners Community Center are 30 miles per hour (MPH).

Figure 2 illustrates the lane geometry at each of the study intersections with data
included for the Carriage House apartments driveway and the internal connection that
allows passage between the apartment complex/Pleasant Grove Road and Corners
Community Center.


IV. EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

A. Peak Intervals for Analysis
     Given the functional characteristics of the land use proposed for the Medical Office
     Building, the peak hours selected for analysis are the weekday commuter AM and PM
     peaks. The combination of site traffic and adjacent through traffic produces the
     greatest demand during these time periods.

B. Existing Traffic Volume Data
     Weekday AM (7:00-9:00AM) and PM (4:00-6:00PM) peak hour volumes were
     collected by SRF at the intersections in the project area on Thursday, April 14, 2016.
     The peak hour traffic periods generally occurred between 7:45-8:45AM and 4:30-
     5:30PM at the study intersections. The weekday AM and PM peak hour existing traffic
     volumes are reflected in Figure 3.


V. FUTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL GROWTH

The proposed Medical Office Building is expected to be built-out in 2017. Village of Cayuga
Heights officials were contacted to discuss projects within the study area that are under
construction and/or approved. One project that was approved 10 years ago was identified
but has not shown progress. This proposed subdivision is located on the vacant land to
the south of Corners Community Center and is an 8-lot subdivision which is anticipated
to have single family dwellings on all but two of the lots.

To account for normal increases in background traffic growth, including the approved
subdivision that has not shown progress, a growth rate of 0.25% has been applied to the
existing traffic volumes to determine the background conditions for the one-year-build-
out period (2017).

The ambient traffic growth rate was derived by comparing past NYSDOT counts to
current estimated AADT. Current AADT was estimated based upon existing 2016 PM
traffic counts and was compared to NYSDOT Counts at two similar locations in the

                                                2                                   May 2016
Traffic Impact Study                Proposed Medical Office Building         Village of Cayuga Heights, NY



project area. These comparisons show little to no annual growth over the last six years.
A growth rate of 0.25% was used to account for background growth and the proposed
subdivision and determine background conditions for the one-year-build-out period
(2017). The background traffic volumes are depicted in Figure 4.


VI. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

A. Description
The proposed Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center consists of one
two-story building with approximately 27,600 gross square footage (SF). The proposed
project entails demolishing an existing one-story 3,600 SF office building and a 1,700 SF
one-story bank building and includes site improvements that provide a total of 300 parking
spaces for the site as well as reconfiguration of internal lane geometry that will no longer
allow ingress/egress of vehicles directly to the Carriage House Apartments and the
Pleasant Grove Road driveway for the apartments. Traffic from the south end of the
shopping center will also be prohibited from exiting to Pleasant Grove Road via the
Carriage House Apartments. Pedestrian and bicycle connections between Corners
Community Center and Carriage House Apartments will remain. Figure 5 illustrates the
proposed concept plan.

B. Site Traffic Generation
The next step in the evaluation is to determine the traffic attributable to the proposed
development as defined, vehicle trips entering and exiting the site. The volume of traffic
generated by a site is dependent on the intended land use and size of the development.
Trip generation is an estimate of the number of trips generated by a specific building or
land use. These trips represent the volume of traffic entering and exiting the development.
Trip Generation, 9th Edition is used as a reference for this information. The trip rate for
the peak hour of the generator may or may not coincide in time or volume with the trip
rate for the peak hour of adjacent street traffic. Volumes generated during the peak hour
of adjacent street traffic, in this case the weekday AM and PM commuter peaks, represent
a more critical volume when analyzing the capacity of the system; those intervals will
provide the basis of this analysis. Table I summarizes the volume of projected trips for
the weekday AM and PM peak hours. All trip generation calculations are included in
Appendix A2 of this report.

C. Site Traffic Distribution
The cumulative effect of site traffic on the transportation network is dependent on the
origins and destinations of that traffic and the location of the access drives serving the
site.

The proposed arrival/departure distribution of traffic to be generated at this site is
considered a function of several parameters, including the following:

                      Location of residential areas;
                      Existing highway network;
                      Existing traffic patterns; and
                      Existing traffic conditions and controls

Figure 6 shows the anticipated trip distribution pattern percentages for full build-out of
the proposed Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center. Given that access
to the proposed Medical Office Building is not possible at a Pleasant Grove Entrance,
vehicles coming from south of Corners Community Center were assumed to use East
Upland Road instead of Pleasant Grove Road to access the proposed project site. Figure
7 shows the resulting total site generated traffic as assigned to the study area intersections
for the weekday AM and PM peak hour periods under full build-out conditions.


VII. FULL DEVELOPMENT VOLUMES

The projected design hour traffic volumes were developed for the weekday AM and PM
peak hours by combining the future background traffic conditions (Figure 4), and projected
site generated volumes for full build-out of the proposed development (Figure 7) to yield
the total traffic conditions expected at full development. Figure 8 illustrates the total
weekday AM and PM peak hour volumes anticipated for the proposed development under
full build-out conditions.


VIII. CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Capacity analysis is a technique used for determining a measure of effectiveness for a
section of roadway and/or intersection based on the number of vehicles during a specific
time period. The measure of effectiveness used for the capacity analysis is referred to as
a Level of Service (LOS). Levels of Service are calculated to provide an indication of the
amount of delay that a motorist experiences while traveling along a roadway or through
an intersection. Since the most amount of delay to motorists usually occurs at
intersections, capacity analysis typically focuses on intersections, as opposed to highway
segments.

Six Levels of Service are defined for analysis purposes. They are assigned letter
designations, from "A" to "F", with LOS "A" representing the best conditions and LOS "F"
the worst. Suggested ranges of service capacity and an explanation of Levels of Service
are included in the Appendix.


                                                        4                                 May 2016
Traffic Impact Study             Proposed Medical Office Building      Village of Cayuga Heights, NY



The standard procedure for capacity analysis of signalized and un-signalized intersections
is outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) published by the Transportation
Research Board. Traffic analysis software, Synchro 9.1, which is based on procedures and
methodologies contained in the HCM 2010, was used to analyze operating conditions at
study area intersections. The procedure yields a Level of Service (LOS) based on the HCM
2010 as an indicator of how well intersections operate.

Existing and background operating conditions during the peak study periods are evaluated
to determine a basis for comparison with the projected future conditions. The future
traffic conditions generated by the proposed development were analyzed to assess the
operations of the intersections in the study area. Capacity results for existing, background,
and full development conditions are listed in Table II. See Figure 2 for numbered
movements that correspond to numbered movements in Table 11. The discussion
following the table summarizes capacity conditions. All capacity analysis calculations are
included in the Appendices.

          lane when volumes are known to increase from existing to background and future conditions.
          This is due to the weighted averaging of independent vehicle movements in that lane performed
          by the simulated traffic program in SYNCHRO 9. When there is an increase in volume in the
          right or through traffic movements in a single lane, which independently have a better LOS (than
          left turns), the weighted average LOS of the overall lane could improve and the calculated delay
          decrease.

Hanshaw Road/ North Triphammer Road
The Hanshaw Road/ North Triphammer Road intersection currently operates at LOS “A”
during the AM peak hour and LOS “C” during the PM peak hour on the eastbound
Hanshaw Road approach. No changes in levels of service are anticipated on this approach.

The southbound North Triphammer Road approach currently operates at LOS “B” for
the left turn lane and LOS “A” for the right turn lane during the AM/PM peak hours.
Under background conditions, the AM peak remain the same at LOS “B” and LOS “A”
for the left turn and right turn lanes respectively. During the PM peak the left turn
movement decreases to an LOS “C” with an increase in delay of 4.5 seconds per vehicle.
The right turn lane remains at LOS “A” with no change in delay. Under full development
conditions both the right and left turn lane during AM and PM peaks are expected to
operate with less delay than the existing conditions for reasons explained in Note 4 and
shown in Table II above. At the Hanshaw Road/North Triphammer Road intersection
there is no projected impact from proposed trips generated by the proposed Medical
Office Building. Therefore, no mitigation is warranted or recommended at this
intersection.

East Upland Road/ Triphammer Road/ Hanshaw Road
The East Upland Road/ Triphammer Road/ Hanshaw Road intersection currently operates
at LOS “B” during the AM peak hour and LOS “F” during the PM peak hour on the
eastbound Triphammer Road approach. Under background conditions, the eastbound
left turn lane decreases from LOS “B” to LOS “C” with a corresponding increase in delay
of 5.1 seconds per vehicle during the AM peak hour. The thru/right lane remains at LOS
“F”. For the full development conditions, the eastbound left turn lane operates at LOS
“C” with an additional delay of 0.4 seconds per vehicle during the AM peak hour. The
thru/right turn movements remain at LOS “F” and is calculated to operate with slightly
less delay than the existing conditions for reasons explained in Note 4 and shown in Table
II above.

The westbound Hanshaw Road approach currently operates at level of service “A” under
existing, background and full development conditions during the AM and PM peak hours.
Full development conditions are not anticipated to create any changes to the LOS on this
approach as shown in Table II.

The northbound East Upland Road approach currently operates at LOS “C” for the AM
peak hour and LOS “F” for the PM peak hour. Under background conditions, the AM
peak hour level of service remains “C” with a slight projected decrease of 0.2 second
delay per vehicle and the PM peak remains LOS “F” with projected delays exceeding 100
seconds per vehicle. Under the full development conditions, AM and PM peak hours are
expected to operate at LOS “C” and LOS “F” respectively.

The southbound Hanshaw Road approach currently operates at LOS “A” under existing,
background, and full development conditions during the AM and PM peak hours.

The proposed Medical Building at Corners Community Center does not change the
projected LOS for any approach at the East Upland Road/Triphammer Road/Hanshaw

Road intersection. A minor change of no more than 0.4 seconds per vehicle in delay over
the background condition is shown in Table II for two of the approaches. Given that this
development is projected to add less than approximately one vehicle every six (6) minutes
to any of the currently failing approaches, no improvements are the responsibility of this
development.

East Upland Road/ East Upland North Entrance
All approaches at the East Upland Road/ East Upland North Entrance intersection operate
at level of service “A” under existing, background and full development conditions during
the AM and PM peak hours. Minor changes are anticipated as a result of the proposed
development as shown in the table above however all approaches will remain level of
service “A” with less than 0.5 seconds per vehicle in delay. Therefore, no mitigation is
warranted or recommended at this intersection.

East Upland Road/ East Upland Middle Entrance
All approaches at the East Upland Road/ East Upland Middle Entrance intersection operate
at level of service “A” under existing, background and full development conditions during
the AM and PM peak hours. Minor changes are anticipated as a result of the proposed
development as shown in the table above but all approaches will remain level of service
“A” with less than 0.5 seconds per vehicle in delay. Therefore, no mitigation is warranted
or recommended at this intersection.

East Upland Road/ East Upland South Entrance
All approaches at the East Upland Road/ East Upland South Entrance intersection operate
at level of service “A” under existing, background and full development conditions during
the AM and PM peak hours. Minor changes are anticipated as a result of the proposed
development as shown in the table above but all approaches will remain level of service
“A” with less than 0.5 seconds per vehicle in delay. Therefore, no mitigation is warranted
or recommended at this intersection.

Hanshaw Road Entrance/ Hanshaw Road
All intersection approaches currently operate at LOS “C” or better during the AM and
PM peak hour. No changes in LOS are anticipated under background or full development
conditions. Therefore, no mitigation is warranted or recommended at this intersection.

Pleasant Grove Road/ Hanshaw Road
The Pleasant Grove Road/ Hanshaw Road intersection currently operates at LOS “D”
during the AM peak hour and LOS “E” during the PM peak hour for the northbound
approach from Pleasant Grove Road turning left onto Hanshaw Road. The northbound
approach turning right onto Hanshaw Road currently operates at LOS “B” for both the
AM and PM peak hours. Under background conditions, the approaches all remain at LOS
“D”, LOS “E” and LOS “B” respectively for AM/PM peak hour. Under full development
conditions, the Pleasant Grove Road northbound left turn movement decreases from LOS
“D” to LOS “E” during the AM peak hour with a corresponding increase in delay of 2.8
seconds per vehicle over projected background conditions. This change in LOS is the
result of a borderline conditions as the threshold between LOS “D” and “E” is a delay of
35.0 seconds per vehicle. During the PM peak hour, the intersection remains at LOS “E”

projected to operate with an increased delay of 1.5 seconds per vehicle. No mitigation is
warranted or recommended at this intersection as a result of the proposed development.

Pleasant Grove Road/ Pleasant Grove Entrance
All approaches at the Pleasant Grove Road/ Pleasant Grove Entrance intersection operate
at level of service “A” under existing, background and full development conditions during
the AM and PM peak hours with no projected increase in delay per vehicle as shown in
Table II above. Therefore, no mitigation is warranted or recommended at this
intersection.


IX. SHARED PARKING ANALYSIS

At present, the total number of off-street parking spaces being proposed on the current
site plan, Figure 5, equals 300 parking spaces. The existing center currently provides 284
parking spaces. Urban Land Institute (ULI) Methodology for shared parking, a national
standard, was used to estimate the number of parking spaces required for the existing
conditions (for comparison purposes) and the proposed development. This methodology
is utilized by traffic engineers and planners when evaluating the parking demand for a
mixed-use project.

Shared parking synergies exist when (a) there are different uses that have peak operating
times at different times of the day, and (b) when there are related or complementary uses
where patrons of one use also access the complementary use. The ULI study also identifies
monthly variations in parking demand by use for each month of the year.

Mixed-use projects such as the one proposed, will experience parking synergy as
described in the preceding paragraph. The parking efficiencies that will result reduce the
excess supply of parking and associated loss of green space, storm drainage impacts and
maintenance expenses. Additionally, it’s important that sufficient parking is provided to
prevent intrusion of parking
into    neighborhoods       or
adjoining         properties,
excessive vehicle circulation,
and dissatisfied tenants and
customers.

Given the proximity of this
site to adjacent residences
and business that are located
within a five-minute walk (see
the radius shown on the
figure to the right), it is likely
that the parking demand is
overestimated since it is
based upon all patrons driving
to the site. In addition, there

                                                    9                                 May 2016
Traffic Impact Study               Proposed Medical Office Building            Village of Cayuga Heights, NY



are Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT) bus stops/shelters located on Pleasant
Grove Road at the Carriage House Apartments and on Triphammer Road just west of
Hanshaw Road. Factors such as carsharing, income, housing tenure, walkability, transit
accessibility, and demographics can impact the total supply of parking needed for a mixed-
use development.

A walkable environment reduces parking needs between 5-15% of the total parking
demand. Providing safe and accessible bicycle parking facilities may further reduce the
parking demand. For a conservative worst case scenario, a 5% reduction factor is applied
in the parking analysis to account for mode share (i.e. walking, bicycling, and transit usage
to access the site. In addition, a conservative 5% reduction is applied to account for trips
internal to the site (i.e. employees or patrons of the businesses on the site will park once
and walk to other businesses on the site such as restaurants, drycleaners, banks, etc.).

Land use data proposed for the Corners Community Center development was entered
in the Shared Parking Model; a spreadsheet that estimates the shared parking demand in
mixed-use projects. The ULI spreadsheet for the proposed development, which shows
the input values and stand-alone parking calculations from the ULI Shared Parking Model,
is included in the Appendices.

Included in the appendices are tables depicting the monthly variation in parking that is
required for weekdays. Based on this information, the peak month at the proposed
development site occurs in December. In addition, there is a table that shows the hourly
variation in parking on the site during the peak month of December for weekdays. The
resulting weekday peak hour parking demand is presented in a tabular and graphical
format. The total weekday parking demand is summarized in Table III and shown in the
ULI Shared Parking Model calculations in the appendices. As previously stated, the total
on-site parking supply included in the proposed site plan is 300 parking spaces.

For comparison purposes, parking needs of the proposed medical office building were
projected as if it were located on its own, self-contained, site. Including the mode share
reduction of 5%, the parking requirement would be 94 spaces.

The second edition of the ITE’s “Shared Parking” manual and the Parking Consultants
Council suggests using the 85th percentile of peak hour parking demand as a target parking
ratio. This level produces an adequate supply cushion that minimizes motorists roaming
for a parking space. The hourly variation table in the appendices shows the hourly parking
requirements during the peak month of December according to the ULI Shared Parking
Model overlap on the parking demand with the shaded area in reflecting the time periods
when this roaming may likely occur. The graph indicates that there is ample parking
provided for the majority of the day, even during the peak month of December. There
may be one to two hours when the parking utilization will be above 85% of the capacity.
Therefore 300 parking spaces is more than adequate for the proposed development.

It is important to note that under existing conditions, there are vehicles parking on the
site that are not patrons or employees of the businesses on the site (i.e. informal park
and ride, nearby businesses, etc.). This results in greater parking usage than would occur
for only the on-site businesses and a perceived parking deficiency. Use of the proposed
parking spaces by motorists that are not employees or patrons of the site may need to
be prohibited and monitored if there appear to be parking deficiencies in the future.


X. MULTI-MODAL CONSIDERATIONS

Bicycle storage should be provided on-site in safe, convenient, well-lit areas through a
combination of short/medium/long-term facilities to encourage employees and visitors to
use alternative modes of transportation.

The proposed site is proposing pedestrian access between the proposed building and
other buildings on the site. Pedestrian accommodations will be provided on-site via
sidewalks, marked crossing locations and signage, where appropriate. All crossing
locations shall be ADA compliant.

The site is currently serviced - and will be continue to be serviced – by TCAT routes 30,
31, 32, 37, and 41. These routes pass nearby the site on either Triphammer Road, where
there is a bus shelter located just west of Hanshaw Road, or Pleasant Grove Road, where
there is a bus shelter located in front of the Carriage House Apartments.

An important benefit of encouraging alternate modes of transportation is to decrease the
total site generated vehicle trips, thereby potentially reducing both the need for on-site
parking and the impact of the proposed site on the study area intersections.

XI. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

This study evaluates the potential traffic and parking impacts resulting from the proposed
Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center. Based upon our comprehensive
analysis, the results indicate that the proposed development will not have significant
adverse traffic or impacts to the existing roadway network or parking impacts to the
existing and proposed conditions. The following sets forth conclusions and
recommendations based upon the results of the analyses:

     1. The proposed Medical Office Building at Corners Community Center is expected
        to generate approximately 52(14) vehicles entering the Corners Community
        Center during the AM(PM) peak hours respectively and 25(66) vehicles exiting the
        Corners Community Center during the AM(PM) peak hours.

     2. The proposed development will not result in any potentially significant adverse
        traffic impacts to the study area intersections.

     3. No mitigation is warranted or recommended at any of the study intersections as
        a result of the proposed Medical Office Building development.

     4. The parking analysis indicates that the proposed parking spaces will be sufficient
        to accommodate parking needs during the majority of the time. During the peak
        month of December there may be times of the day when the parking lots reach
        90% capacity.

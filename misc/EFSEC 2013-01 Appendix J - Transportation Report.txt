EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Tesoro Savage Petroleum Terminal LLC (the Applicant) is proposing to construct a facility to receive
petroleum by rail, store it on site, and ship it via the Columbia River to various users/refiners on the
West Coast. The proposed facility involves three separate Port property areas; Terminal 5, Parcel 1A,
and Berths 13 and 14 along the Columbia River. These areas are all zoned appropriately for the

proposed industrial use and are currently used for marine cargo laydown, temporary storage of scrap
metal and a marine lay berth.

The proposed development will begin operations in 2015 and reach peak operations by 2020. At that
time, the proposed facility will be handling a maximum of 360,000 barrels of petroleum per day, an
average of 4 unit trains per day, and is expected to reach peak employment of 110 workers.

Traffic associated with the proposed site development will primarily access the Port's Terminal 5 area
via Lower River Road (SR 501) west, Old Lower River Road south, and the Old Alcoa Facility Access
Road to the east. From this road, access driveways will be established to separate parking lots
adjacent to the facility's administrative and support buildings (Facility Area 200), just north of the
loop track.

A site vicinity map is shown in Figure 1 with the proposed site plan shown in Figure 2.


Study Findings and Recommendations
This study concludes that acceptable levels of traffic operations and safety can be maintained at the
study intersections with the build-out of the proposed development. Key study findings and
recommendations are as follows:


Findings
           All study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
           hours and are projected to continue to do so in 2020 and 2025 with site development.
           A review of historical crash data identified no safety-related mitigation needs at the study
           intersections.
           Intersection sight distance is adequate at all study intersections.
           The proposed development is estimated to generate 332 average daily trips, 48 weekday a.m.
           peak hour trips (40 in, 8 out), and 46 weekday p.m. peak hour trips (10 in, 36 out).


Recommendations
           The applicant should work with the Port of Vancouver and City of Vancouver to post a 25
           MPH speed limit on Old Lower River Road south of SR 501, where no posted speed sign exists.
           The applicant should work with the Port and WSDOT to post a YIELD sign to control the
           channelized northbound right-turn maneuver from Old Lower River Road onto SR 501.
           The applicant should work with the Port and City of Vancouver to reconfigure traffic control
           devices at the Old Lower River Road/Old Alcoa Facility Access Road intersection.

           The applicant should work with the Port to add texturing/coloring treatments to the striped
           crosswalk on the private access approach to Lower River Road (SR 501), between the Far
           West Steel operation and the proposed Storage Tank area.
           The applicant should properly locate and maintain any new landscaping, signage, and/or
           above-ground utilities installed along the site frontage and internal roadways to ensure that
           adequate sight distance continues to be available.

SCOPE OF REPORT
This transportation impact analysis determines the transportation-related impacts associated with
the proposed site development. The study intersections and overall study area for this project were
determined based on a review of existing travel patterns, the traffic impact analysis requirements
pursuant to Vancouver Municipal Code (VMC) Sections 11.80.130 and 11.80.080, the City's Traffic
Study Guidelines, the City of Vancouver's Concurrency Ordinance (VMC 11.70), and direction
provided by City of Vancouver staff through the project scoping process.


Transportation Concurrency Corridors and Study Intersections
The study site is located within Transportation Analysis Zone (TAZ) #38. In accordance with
Vancouver's Transportation Concurrency ordinance, this report summarizes the number of weekday
p.m. peak hour site-generated trips impacting each of the City's adopted concurrency corridors. Site -
generated trips within the City were tracked to the following City-modeled concurrency corridors:
           Fourth Plain Boulevard (Port of Vancouver to I-5)
           Mill Plain Boulevard (Fourth Plain Boulevard to I-5)


Analysis Periods
Weekday morning (6:00 - 9:00 a.m.) and evening (4:00 - 6:00 p.m.) peak hour traffic conditions were
modeled at the study intersections.


Study Intersections
Per the VMC and City staff direction, operational analysis was prepared at the following study
intersections:

           Old Lower River Road/Lower River Road (SR 501)
           Gateway Avenue/Lower River Road (SR 501)
           Fourth Plain Boulevard/Mill Plain Boulevard (SR 501)

Conclusions and recommendations are provided following the analysis and documentation herein.


INTERSECTION ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
All level-of-service (LOS) and volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio analyses described in this report were
performed in accordance with the procedures stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(Reference 1). A description of level of service, how it is measured, the criteria by which it is
determined, and generally acceptable ranges of level of service are presented in Appendix "A".

The peak 15-minute flow rate was used in the evaluation of all intersection operations to ensure that
this study was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario. For this reason, the operations analyses
reflect conditions that are only likely to occur for 15 minutes out of each average weekday a.m. and
p.m. peak hour. Traffic conditions during all other weekday hours will likely operate under better
conditions than those described in this report.

For the intersections operations analyses, Synchro Version 8.0 software was used to analyze the
study intersections along SR 501. Due to the unique traffic control characteristics of the Old Lower
River Road/Old Alcoa Facility Access Road intersection, a separate software program, SIDRA Version
5.1 was used to properly model the delay associated with stop-controlled and free-flow movements.

Intersection Operating Standards
VMC Section 11.80.130B requires signalized intersections under City jurisdiction to maintain LOS "E"
and a v/c ratio less than 0.95. Unsignalized intersections must maintain a v/c ratio less than 0.95 for
the critical movement and/or approach.

SR 501, which overlaps Lower River Road and then Mill Plain Boulevard to the southeast, is under the
jurisdiction of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Therefore,
intersections along SR 501 are subject to WSDOT's traffic operation standards, which require LOS "D"
or better.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of roadways within the study area. This section creates a basis for comparison to
future conditions. The study site was visited and inventoried in July 2013. At that time, information
was collected regarding site conditions, adjacent land uses, existing traffic conditions, and
transportation facilities in the study area.


Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The proposed development site is located in three separate Port of Vancouver properties: a portion
of Terminal 5, all of Parcel 1A, and Berths 13 and 14 along the Columbia River. At Terminal 5, two
additional railroad loop tracks will be added inside the current loop tracks (constructed in 2010) to
unload petroleum from incoming rail cars (see Areas 200 and 600 on site plan). Parcel 1A, just east of
the Farwest Steel operation, is currently used for marine cargo laydown and temporary storage of
steel scrap and will be the location of a series of holding tanks (a.k.a. Product Storage Tanks)
designed to temporarily store petroleum (see Area 300 on site plan). Lastly, Berths 13 and 14 along
the Columbia River, just south of the Subaru of America lot, will be used to transfer petroleum onto
barges and ships (see Area 400 on site plan).

Recent completion of the loop track at Terminal 5 is part of ongoing efforts by the Port to complete
the West Vancouver Freight Access project. Construction efforts are currently underway to complete
a new grade-separated crossing for Gateway Avenue to pass over the adjacent rail line. These
improvements will provide access to Terminal 5 properties south of the rail line, including the Clark
County Corrections Jail Work Center and Subaru of America Lot along Harborside Drive. Terminal 5 is
also the location of the future BHP Billiton Bulk Potash Handling Facility; preliminary construction has
begun and the facility is expected to be completed in in mid-2015.

There are a variety of other marine and industrial businesses in the vicinity of the Tesoro Savage
Vancouver Energy Distribution Terminal site. Other nearby industrial businesses include Subaru of
America, Kelly Steel, Tri-Star, FarWest Steel Corporation, West Van Materials Recovery Center, and
Tidewater. There is also a propane terminal (operated by Keyera) and a gas fired turbine power plant

  Although not formally designated as bike lanes, there is fog line striping and sufficient paved shoulder on both sides of SR 501 for bicycle travel.


SR 501
State Route (SR) 501 is operated and maintained by WSDOT. West of I-5, this highway leads west out
of the downtown Vancouver area along Mill Plain Boulevard and then along Lower River Road west of
the Fourth Plain Boulevard/Mill Plain Boulevard intersection. As Mill Plain Boulevard, the highway has
5 lanes of travel and urban design features including a landscaped median, bicycle lanes and
sidewalks. West of the Fourth Plain Boulevard intersection, the highway becomes more rural in
nature, where it reduces down to 2 travel lanes with left-turn lanes provided at major intersections.
The highway generally has wide paved shoulders and fog line striping for bicycle travel and there is a
multi-use path at intermittent locations along the south side of the road.


Gateway Avenue
Gateway Avenue is the main entrance to Terminal 5 at the Port of Vancouver. The roadway is a
private road with two travel lanes, partial sidewalks and on-street parking is allowed.

Old Lower River Road
Old Lower River Road extends south from Lower River Road (SR 501) and then west to provide access
to local industrial businesses before it circles back to SR 501 to the northwest. It is a public local road
with two lanes of travel, no sidewalks or bicycle lanes, and no on-street parking.


Old Alcoa Access Facility Road
The Old Alcoa Access Facility Road extends east from where Old Lower River Road turns southbound-
to-westbound. This private road has two travel lanes, a posted speed of 15 MPH and no sidewalks. It
leads east to the Keyera propane facility and a gate that prevents further travel east.


Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are installed along Mill Plain Boulevard and Fourth Plain Boulevard. While
there are no designated bicycle lanes along Lower River Road (SR 501), a two-way multiuse path was
recently installed along the south side of SR 501 starting at Gateway Avenue and proceeding east
along the FarWest Steel property frontage. This path also extends along the site frontage of the Tank
Farm area of the Tesoro Savage project and includes a striped crosswalk and signage at the private
access to SR 501 between the FarWest Steel and the proposed Storage Tank area.

No continuous sidewalks or bicycle lanes are installed on the local streets that lead directly to the
site, namely Gateway Avenue and Old Lower River Road.


Transit Facilities
The nearest fixed-route public transit service to the site is provided at the Mill Plain Boulevard/Fourth
Plain Boulevard intersection, and provided by C-Tran (Reference 2). The intersection is roughly 0.75
miles east of the easternmost portion of the site. Route #25 serves the intersection and provides
service between 39th Street/Fruit Valley Road, downtown Vancouver, and the 99th Street Transit
Center. Service is provided on weekdays at approximately 35-minute headways and on weekends at
approximately 50-minute headways. Route #25 travels on Fruit Valley Road, Fourth Plain Boulevard,
and Mill Plain Boulevard.

The Port of Vancouver is in the process of developing a multi-modal path along Lower River Road (SR
501) to the bus service line at the Mill Plain/Fourth Plain intersection.


Crash Analysis
A five-year crash history of all study intersections (data reported from January 2008 through
December 2012) was obtained from WSDOT in an effort to identify potential safety issues. Key crash
variables (e.g., type, severity, etc.) were reviewed at each intersection to assess whether any crash
patterns might be identifiable.

Table 2 presents a summary of the 5-year crash history at the study intersections in terms of crashes
by type, severity, and per million entering vehicles (MEV). The City's Traffic Study Guidelines identify
a crash rate greater than or equal to 1.0 crashes/MEV as a threshold that determines the need for

  The private drive intersection with Lower River Road (SR 501) between the Far West Steel property and the proposed Tesoro Savage Tank Farm
area was established in the last two years and no crash data was available for this intersection. Given the limited use of this road, its recent
construction in accordance with City design standards and sufficient intersection sight distance (as observed and noted in the previous section of
this report), there are no apparent traffic safety issues at this location.


As shown in the previous table, the study intersections have a crash rate of less than one crash per
million entering vehicles. Based on the crash review, and in accordance with City requirements for
thresholds exceeding 1.0 crashes/MEV, no apparent safety hazards or safety-based mitigation
measures were identified. Appendix "B" contains the crash data used for the crash analysis.


Existing Lane Configurations and Traffic Control Devices
Figure 3 illustrates the existing lane configurations and traffic control devices at the study
intersections. Each of the intersections is also described below.


Fourth Plain Boulevard/Mill Plain Boulevard (SR 501)
This four-legged intersection is signalized and operates with protected left-turn phasing on the
mainline approaches of Mill Plain Boulevard and permitted left-turn phasing on the Fourth Plain and
St. Francis Lane approaches. The traffic signal is isolated, and therefore, not coordinated with other
signals along Mill Plain Boulevard. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal control are installed on the
southwest and southeast intersection approaches. Pedestrians are not accommodated on the other
two approaches. The westbound approach on Fourth Plain Boulevard has a free right turn lane that
merges with northbound-to-westbound Mill Plain Boulevard traffic at speed.

Gateway Avenue/Lower River Road (SR 501)
This T-shaped intersection operates with stop-control on the minor street approach of Gateway
Avenue. An exclusive left-turn lane is provided for movements off the highway.


Old Lower River Road /Lower River Road (SR 501)
This T-shaped intersection operates with stop-control on the minor street approach of Old Lower
River Road; however, the northbound right-turn movement from Old Lower River Road is channelized
with no posted traffic control. That impact analysis conservatively assumes the northbound right-turn
movement is stop-controlled for delay calculation purposes, even though drivers may only yield
before merging with mainstream traffic.


Old Lower River Road /Old Alcoa Facility Access Road
This four-legged intersection is intersected by the public portion of Old Lower River Road (north and
west legs only), the private portion of the Old Alcoa Facility Access Road (east leg), and an outbound-
only driveway coming from the rail loop track and "perimeter road" at Terminal 5. Traffic control is as
follows:

           Southbound approach: stop-controlled with a "Right Turn Permitted Without Stopping" sign
           Northbound approach: stop controlled
           Eastbound approach: uncontrolled
           Westbound approach: stop-controlled
The traffic control configuration allows the current primary southbound-to-westbound and
eastbound-to-northbound movements on the public section of Old Lower River Road to occur freely
while stopping all other movements.


Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic counts were obtained at the study intersections on mid-week days in May 2013 during the
weekday morning (6:00 ­ 9:00 a.m.) and afternoon (4:00 ­ 6:00 p.m.) peak periods. The counts were
compiled and reviewed to identify the peak hour periods for the street system, which occurred from
7:00 ­ 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 ­ 5:00 p.m.

As shown in Figure 3 and in Table 3, all study intersections currently operate within acceptable
operations thresholds during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

BASELINE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The baseline traffic conditions analysis estimates operating conditions for the year 2020, when the
proposed Tesoro Savage Vancouver Energy Distribution Terminal is expected to operate at full
capacity and at full employment. Also, a baseline future forecast for the year 2025 was prepared, per
the City's TIA requirements, to identify how the study area's transportation system will operate five
years after completion of the proposed development.

This baseline analysis includes general traffic growth in the region, vehicle trips generated by in-
process developments in the site's vicinity, but does not include traffic from the proposed
development. It also accounts for planned transportation improvement projects not associated with
the proposed site development.


Planned Roadway Improvements
As noted earlier in this report the Port of Vancouver is completing several street improvement
projects to improve access to Terminal 5 and other areas of the Port. The Port has constructed a
"perimeter road" around the outside of the loop track connecting Old Lower River Road with
Harborside Drive and a new grade-separated structure for Gateway Avenue to convey the roadway
over the railroad tracks. Access to Berths 13 and 14 along the Columbia River will also be established.
These improvements will help reduce internal site traffic use of Lower River Road (SR 501) traveling
between site areas. No other funded street improvements were identified in the study area.

Build-Out Year 2020 Baseline Traffic Conditions
A 1.5-percent linear annual growth rate was applied to existing year 2013 peak hour traffic volumes
over a 7-year period to develop year 2020 baseline traffic volumes for the weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hours. This growth rate was applied to major traffic movements at the study intersections along
SR 501 intersections, but not at minor connections related to Port properties such as Gateway
Avenue and Old Lower River Road.

One in-process development was identified and included in the 2020 baseline traffic volumes; the
Terminal 5 Bulk Potash Handling Facility. The approved Bulk Potash Handling Facility development is
to be located west of the proposed site. The vehicle trips generated from this in-process
development were assigned to the study intersections based on the trip generation and assignment
contained in the Bulk Potash Handling Facility Transportation Impact Analysis (Reference 3).

Figures 4 and 5 and Table 4 illustrate the build-out year 2020 baseline traffic conditions for the
respective weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour periods. As shown, the study intersections are forecast
to continue to operate acceptably under these scenarios during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
hours.

Forecast Year 2025 Baseline Traffic Conditions
Year 2020 baseline traffic volumes were further increased by a 1.5 percent linear annual growth rate
to develop year 2025 baseline traffic volumes. Consistent with the 2020 analysis, the growth rate
was applied to major traffic movements of study intersections along SR 501. No additional in-process
developments or planned roadway improvements were identified at the study intersections for the
2025 forecast year.

TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
This report section presents the proposed development plan, its anticipated trip generation, trip
distribution and assignment, the operational impacts of site trips on the study intersections, and
required trip assignment to the City of Vancouver's concurrency corridors.


Proposed Development Plan
Tesoro Savage Petroleum Terminal LLC (the applicant) is proposing to construct a facility to receive
petroleum by rail, store it on site, and ship it via the Columbia River to various users/refiners on the
West Coast. The development proposal, known as the Tesoro Savage Vancouver Energy Distribution
Terminal, is to begin operations in 2015 and reach peak operations (full staffing) by the year 2020. At
that time, the proposed facility will be processing a maximum of 360,000 barrels of petroleum per
day, an average of 4 unit trains per day, and reach peak employment of 110 workers. Descriptions of
the facility processing areas comprising the site are described in the following sections.


Terminal 5
The portion of Terminal 5 associated with this project is located along the south side of the Old Alcoa
Facility Access Road. It involves Area 600 (West Boiler Area) and Area 200 (Uloading & Office Area) as
shown in the site plan. In this area, the applicant is proposing to construct new loop track lines
within the existing loop track along with a structure used to unload petroleum delivered by unit

and along the south side of the Old Alcoa Facility Access Road. The buildings will be used by facility
employees to park their personal vehicles during the workday, begin and end their workday, and to
conduct normal business operations.

Vehicular access to this portion of Terminal 5 will occur from Lower River Road (SR 501) via the public
access to Old Lower River Road, and then the Old Alcoa Facility Access Road.


Parcel 1A
Parcel 1A is located along the south side of Lower River Road (SR 501) just east of the FarWest Steel
Corporation site. A series of storage tanks will be built as shown in the site plan (Area 300 ­ Storage)
for temporary storage of petroleum. Parking at the storage tank are will be limited to a few stalls and
will be used for occasional routine maintenance; no peak hour "commute" trips to this area are
anticipated. Vehicular access to the storage tank area will be provided via SR 501 and the existing
private drive located along the east side of FarWest Steel Corporation.


Berths 13 and 14
Berths 13 and 14 to the Columbia River are located southeast of Terminal 5 and just south of the
Subaru America car lot. These berths, as shown in the site plan (Area 400 -Marine Terminal) will be
used to pump petroleum onto barges or ships.

Vehicular access to the berths will be provided by a new connection to Harborside Drive and Gateway
Avenue as part of a Port project. Like the storage tank area, vehicle parking at the berths will be
limited to a few stalls and no peak hour "commute" trips to this area are anticipated.


Site Trip Generation
Trip generation estimates of daily and weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour vehicle trip ends for the
proposed development were calculated using the standard reference manual, Trip Generation, 9th
Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (Reference 4). ITE trip rates for land
use code 110 (Light Industrial) were used as the basis for estimating vehicle trips. These rates, using
permanent employees as the independent variable, are based on empirical observations at other
similar industrial developments.

Table 6 shows the estimated trip generation for the proposed industrial use.

Truck Traffic
Because the primary function of the proposed facility is to transfer petroleum from rail cars onto
nearby barges, post-construction operations of the proposed development are not expected to
generate tractor-trailer trucks trips on the external street network on typical days. Instead, typical
delivery and service vehicle trips are expected. A separate discussion of contractor trips and
construction-related truck trips is provided later in this report.


Site Trip Distribution and Assignment
The estimated vehicle trip distribution pattern was based on a review of the existing weekday a.m.
and p.m. traffic counts at the Lower River Road (SR 501)/Old Lower River Road intersection, (where
all external trips are expected to enter and exit the site) as well as the existing patterns observed at
the Mill Plain Boulevard (SR 501)/Fourth Plain Boulevard intersection.

As shown in Figures 4 and 5, all weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour site trips were assigned to points
east along SR 501, reflecting the location of the Port of Vancouver and major destinations to the east
such as the downtown area of Vancouver and I-5.


Build-Out Year 2020 Total Traffic Conditions
The year build-out year 2020 total traffic analysis identifies how the study area's transportation
system will operate with the proposed development complete and operating at full capacity and full
employment. This analysis includes general regional traffic growth, traffic generated due to in-
process developments and the vehicle trips generated from the proposed development.

Figures 4 and 5 and Table 7 also illustrate the year 2020 total traffic conditions. As shown, all study
intersections are forecast to continue to operate adequately during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
hours.

Vehicle Queuing Analysis
Vehicle queuing analyses were using the SimTraffic software for the study intersections along Lower
River Road (SR 501) and using the SIDRA software for the Old Lower River Road/Old Alcoa Facility
Access Road intersection. Tables 9 and 10 show the forecast 95th percentile vehicle queues for the
year 2020 and 2025 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour conditions, both without and with the
development project. One vehicle was assumed to occupy 25 feet of space for this analysis. Appendix
"J" includes the queuing analysis worksheets.

As shown in the previous two tables, the forecast queues can be accommodated within the available
storage at the identified study intersections, during both the a.m. and p.m. peak periods.


INTERSECTION SIGHT DISTANCE
Per VMC Section 11.80.140, public and private streets must comply with the sight distance standards
specified in A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets standards (AASHTO, Reference 5).
To address this requirement, the proposed development plan was reviewed to ensure that drivers
associated with the site development (normal traffic & construction traffic) have adequate
intersection sight distance at key intersections in the site vicinity. Table 11 shows the results of the
sight distance analysis for stop-controlled movements at key intersections. As shown in the following
table, all locations currently have adequate intersection sight distance.

 Minimum AASHTO distances shown reflect posted speed of roadway, which is 50 MPH along Lower River Road (SR 501). Where posted speed is
not provided (i.e. Old Lower River Road) and no other data is available, the Basic Rule speed of 55 MPH was assumed. An 85th percentile speed of
24 MPH was recorded along Old Lower River Road, west of the Old Alcoa Facility Access Road.

It should be noted that the private drive access along the east side of the FarWest Steel property and
its connection with Lower River Road (SR 501) was included in the sight distance analysis, given this
connection has the potential to be used by site traffic. Additionally, there is no posted speed limit on
Old Lower River Road, south of SR 501. Therefore, the 55 MPH Basic Rule speed was assumed to
apply to free-flowing traffic approaching from Old Lower River Road, except west of the Old Alcoa
Facility Access Road intersection, where a speed survey conducted along Old Lower River Road
indicated an 85th percentile travel speed of 24 MPH . Appendix "K" contains the results of this speed
survey.


ON-SITE ACCESS AND TRAFFIC CIRCULATION
On-site access and traffic circulation was evaluated based on the proposed site plan. As stated in the
trip generation section of this report, most, if not all, site trips will travel to/from the administrative
and support buildings on the Terminal 5 property (Area 200- Unloading and Office). Traffic will
access this location using Lower River Road (SR 501) and Old Lower River Road. After making a left-
turn onto the Old Alcoa Facility Access Road, site traffic will have the option of using one of several
new driveways to separate parking lots next to the administrative buildings.

Any site trips associated with the storage tank area on Parcel 1A (Area 300 ­ Storage) to the
northeast will use Lower River Road (SR 501) to access the private access drive east of FarWest Steel.
Any trips associated with the petroleum loading operation at Berths 13 and 14 along the Columbia
River will use a new driveway connection to Harborside Drive, which will connect with Gateway
Avenue and the internal ring road around the loop track which leads to Old Lower River Road and the
administrative buildings on the Terminal 5 property.


ACCESS SPACING
The proposed development relies on taking access to public and private street connections that are
already established and in conformance with City of Vancouver access spacing requirements, per
VMC Section 11.080.110.


CONSTRUCTION TRAFFIC IMPACTS
The proposed Tesoro Savage Vancouver Energy Distribution Terminal will generate traffic during
facility construction. To account for the traffic-related impacts, construction worker and truck
delivery traffic have been estimated and analyzed.


Construction Year 2014 Baseline Traffic Conditions
Construction of the proposed development is estimated to occur over a 9-month period in 2014. An
annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, consistent with build-out and forecast year growth, was applied to

major traffic movements at the study intersections along SR 501 intersections, but not at minor
connections related to Port properties such as Gateway Avenue and Old Lower River Road. In
addition to background traffic growth, the construction traffic associated with the BHP Billiton site
was accounted for as in-process traffic. As per the Terminal 5 Transportation Management Plan, 177
daily construction workers and 64 daily truck deliveries are estimated during a majority of BHP
Billiton site construction (KAI, Reference 6). The associated freight access plan was referenced to
determine site access and circulation patterns for these workers and trucks during the a.m. and p.m.
peak hours. The resulting construction year 2014 a.m. and p.m. peak hour background traffic
volumes and operations results are presented in Table 12 Figures 6 and 7, respectively. As shown, the
study intersections operate acceptably in both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

Appendix "L" includes the in-process trip generation and freight route from the Terminal 5 TMP.

Site Construction Trip Generation
During the 9-month construction period, the proposed development site will generate construction
worker and truck delivery traffic. Tesoro Savage estimates a total of 125 daily construction workers
and 83 daily, round trip truck deliveries.

Table 13 shows the estimated trips generated due to construction of the proposed development.

The 125 construction workers were assumed to arrive during the a.m. peak period and depart during
the p.m. peak period. The 83 roundtrip truck deliveries were distributed across the 10-hour daily
construction schedule; as such, an estimated 16 total truck deliveries were assumed during both the
a.m. and p.m. peak periods (8 in, 8 out), respectively.


Site Construction Trip Distribution and Assignment
Based on trip distribution pattern estimates by Tesoro Savage, all construction worker traffic will use
the Old Lower River Road entrance from Lower River Road (SR 501). Tesoro Savage also estimates
that 11% of trucks will use Old Lower River Road entrance from Lower River Road (SR 501), 3% will
use Gateway Avenue, and 86% will use the private access drive east of FarWest Steel.


Construction Year 2014 Total Traffic Conditions
The impact of construction site generated trips on intersection operations are shown in Table 14 as
well as Figures 6 and 7 for the a.m. and p.m. peak periods, respectively. As shown, the study
intersections operate acceptably in both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

Appendix "M" contains the construction year 2014 traffic conditions operational analysis worksheets.


Construction Truck Traffic
As stated previously, there will be up to an estimated 83 round-trip truck deliveries (83 in, 83 out)
occurring on weekdays at the site over the course of the 9-month construction schedule. These trips
will generally occur within the construction staging period between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. During
peak traffic periods on the adjacent major street network, only 16 trucks (8 in, 8 out) are estimated
to occur during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively.

occasion, when traffic congestion occurs along I-5, truck drivers may use the designated truck route
along Fruit Valley Road via either 39th Street or 78th Street. However, the magnitude of truck trips is
anticipated to be small, given the low peak hour truck trip projections and presence of other truck
route options. The Applicant will make best efforts to require construction truck drivers to route their
deliveries via Mill Plain Boulevard and Fourth Plain Boulevard.

It should also be emphasized, again, that the primary function of the proposed facility is to transfer
petroleum from rail cars onto nearby barges. Therefore, post-construction operations of the
proposed development are not expected to generate any significant truck traffic on the external
street network save for typical delivery and service vehicles.

INTERSECTION TRAFFIC CONTROL CHANGES
While the operational analyses documented in this report found adequate capacity is available at the
study intersections, four traffic control changes and/or enhancements are recommended as
described below1.

           The applicant should work with the Port of Vancouver and City of Vancouver to post a 25
           MPH speed limit on Old Lower River Road south of SR 501, where no posted speed sign exists.
           Based on a review of turn movement patterns, intersection configuration, and the Manual on
           Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD, Reference 7), the applicant should work with the
           Port and WSDOT to post a YIELD sign to control the channelized northbound right-turn
           maneuver from Old Lower River Road onto SR 501. A YIELD sign is appropriate given that
           northbound right-turn drivers have sufficient sight distance to make a decision to enter and
           merge with the highway traffic stream, and the ability to enter the highway without stopping
           reduces the time and distance drivers need to fully merge into the through lane, benefiting
           both side street and highway traffic.
           The applicant should work with the Port and City of Vancouver to reconfigure traffic control
           devices at the Old Lower River Road/Old Alcoa Facility Access Road intersection.
           The applicant should work with the Port to add texturing/coloring treatments to the striped
           crosswalk on the private access approach to Lower River Road (SR 501), between the Far
           West Steel operation and the proposed Storage Tank area. This treatment is intended to
           enhance the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians using this crosswalk as part of the adjacent
           multi-use path.


CONCURRENCY CORRIDOR TRIP ASSIGNMENT
As part of the transportation impact analysis, the number of trips assigned to the City of Vancouver's
Transportation concurrency corridors has been evaluated. The two corridors impacted by the
development are Mill Plain Boulevard (Fourth Plain Boulevard to I-5) and Fourth Plain Boulevard (Mill
Plain Boulevard to I-5).

Table 15 summarizes the total number of weekday p.m. peak hour trips entering each of the City's
adopted concurrency corridors. Assigned trips were recorded counting trips only once along each of
the specified sections.

    Regardless of site development, the changes below could also be implemented by the Port of Vancouver in
advance of site development, subject to local agency and Port approval.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the transportation impact analysis, the proposed Tesoro Savage Vancouver
Energy Distribution Terminal can be developed while maintaining acceptable levels of service and
safety on the surrounding transportation system. The analysis developed the following findings and
recommendations.


Findings
           All study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
           hours and are projected to do so in 2020 and 2025 with site development.

           A review of historical crash data identified no safety-related mitigation needs at the study
           intersections.
           Intersection sight distance is adequate at all study intersections.
           The proposed development is estimated to generate 332 additional daily trips, 48 weekday
           a.m. peak hour trips (40 in, 8 out), and 46 weekday p.m. peak hour trips (10 in, 36 out).


Recommendations
           The applicant should work with the Port of Vancouver and City of Vancouver to post a 25
           MPH speed limit on Old Lower River Road south of SR 501, where no posted speed sign exists.
           The applicant should work with the Port and WSDOT to post a YIELD sign to control the
           channelized northbound right-turn maneuver from Old Lower River Road onto SR 501.
           The applicant should work with the Port and City of Vancouver to reconfigure traffic control
           devices at the Old Lower River Road/Old Alcoa Facility Access Road intersection.
           The applicant should work with the Port to add texturing/coloring treatments to the striped
           crosswalk on the private access approach to Lower River Road (SR 501), between the Far
           West Steel operation and the proposed Storage Tank area.
           Any new landscaping, signage, and/or above-ground utilities installed along the site frontage
           and internal roadways should be properly located and maintained to ensure that adequate
           sight distance continues to be available.
We trust this report adequately addresses the traffic impacts and associated with the proposed
Tesoro Savage Vancouver Energy Distribution Terminal. Please contact us if you have any questions
or comments regarding the contents of this report or the analyses performed.

Level of Service Concept
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed by traffic engineers to gauge the overall quality of the
travel experience through an intersection or roadway segment as it is perceived by the traveler. Six
categories are used to denote the various levels of service, which range from A to F.


Signalized Intersections
At signalized intersections, level of service is defined by a single performance measure: average
control delay per vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-
up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Table A1 provides a qualitative description of
each LOS category as it applies to signalized intersections, and Table A2 identifies the average control
delay threshold point used as the boundary for each LOS category. LOS thresholds for the specific
reviewing jurisdiction(s) are described in the body of the report.

                                                      Table A1
                                Level of Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

   Level of Service                                                     Average Delay per Vehicle
                         Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable,
          A              and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also
                         contribute to low delay.
                         Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This
          B              generally occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A,
                         causing higher levels of average delay.
                         Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These
                         higher delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear
          C
                         at this level. The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the
                         intersection without stopping.
                         Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The
                         influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable
          D
                         progression, long cycle length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not
                         stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.
                         Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is
          E              usually considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor
                         progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                         Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This
                         condition often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many
          F
                         individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values, even
                         when the volume/capacity ratio is significantly below 1.0.

Unsignalized Intersections
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled
(AWSC) intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual provides models for estimating average
control delay at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. Table A3 provides a qualitative description of
each LOS category as it applies to unsignalized intersections, and Table A4 identifies the average
control delay threshold point used as the boundary for each LOS category. LOS thresholds for the
specific reviewing jurisdiction(s) are described in the body of the report.

                                    Nearly all drivers find freedom of operation with very little time spent waiting for an acceptable gap.

                                    It is not uncommon for an arriving driver to find a standing queue of at least one additional vehicle.

It should be noted that the level of service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is
that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities.
The expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less onerous than at unsignalized intersections.
For example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers
on the minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of
identifying acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the
amount of delay experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized
intersections. For these reasons, the control delay threshold for any given level of service has been
set to be less for an unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall
intersection level of service is calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated
for the minor approaches and the major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No
delay is assumed to the major street through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall
intersection level of service remains undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor
street lane.

In the performance evaluation of unsignalized intersections, it is important to consider other
measures of effectiveness (MOE's) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements,
average queue lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst
movement only, such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic
control decisions.

Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay (HCM 2000).
Vehicle movement LOS values are based on average delay per movement
Minor Road Approach LOS values are based on average delay for all vehicle movements.
NA: Intersection LOS and Major Road Approach LOS values are Not Applicable for two-way sign control since the average delay is not a good
LOS measure due to zero delays associated with major road movements.
HCM Delay Model used. Geometric Delay not included.

Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay (HCM 2000).
Vehicle movement LOS values are based on average delay per movement
Minor Road Approach LOS values are based on average delay for all vehicle movements.
NA: Intersection LOS and Major Road Approach LOS values are Not Applicable for two-way sign control since the average delay is not a good
LOS measure due to zero delays associated with major road movements.
HCM Delay Model used. Geometric Delay not included.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Proposed Development Plan
The proposed Humboldt County Community Corrections Reentry Resource Center (HCCCRRC) and New
County Office Facility constitute an ultimately 80,000 square feet expansion to the existing Humboldt
County Courthouse and Jail Complex in the City of Eureka bounded by 4th Street to the north, 5th Street
to the south, K Street to the east and the existing Humboldt County Jail to the west. Phase 1 of
HCCCRRC will result in 25 employees relocating from a facility located two blocks from the Site and 12
employees shifting over from the existing jail. No new employees will be hired for Phase 1. And in Phase
2 (total build-out), the New County Office Facility would add an additional 77 employees.


Trip Generation
Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition (commonly referred
to as the ITE Trip Generation Manual), the proposed HCCCRRC and New County Office Facility would
generate an estimated total of 20 a.m. and 23 p.m. peak hour trips in Phase 1 and 67 a.m. and 84 p.m.
peak hour trips in Phase 2.

The project’s traffic impacts were estimated by considering the amount of traffic to be generated by
the project and the directional distribution of that traffic. Existing and future a.m. and p.m. peak hour
conditions with and without the project were analyzed for this project.


FINDINGS

Existing No Project Conditions
Under Existing No Project conditions, the following intersections are expected to perform below the
applicable level of service standards (LOS C for the City of Eureka and Caltrans District 1):
               o 4th Street & K Street; and,
               o 4th Street & L Street.
All other study intersections were found to be operating at a satisfactory level of service based on the
applicable standards and no signal warrants were met. No queueing issues were identified at any of the
study intersections using 95th percentile queue analysis.


Existing Plus Project Phase 1 Conditions
With the addition of project traffic from Phase 1,



                                                                     9

          The following intersections are expected to perform below the applicable level of service
           standards:
               o 4th Street & K Street; and,
               o 4th Street & L Street.
          All other intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily.
          None of the unsignalized study intersections met signal warrants.
          No queueing issues were identified at any of the study intersections using 95th percentile
           queue analysis.
Based on the provided City of Eureka traffic study guidelines and Caltrans Traffic Impact Study
Guidelines1, there are no significant impacts requiring mitigations.


Existing Plus Project Phase 2 Conditions
With the addition of project traffic from Phase 2 (total build-out including Phase 1),

          The following intersections are expected to perform below the applicable level of service
           standards:
               o 4th Street & K Street; and,
               o 4th Street & L Street.
          The project’s impacts were found to be significant at the 4th Street & K Street intersection.
           Mitigation measures to reduce the project’s impacts to less than significant are summarized in
           Table 1.
          All other intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily.
          None of the unsignalized study intersections met signal warrants.
          No queueing issues were identified at any of the study intersections using 95th percentile
           queue analysis.


Cumulative (2035) No Project Conditions
Using a growth rate provided by the City of Eureka – 1.4 percent per year, existing a.m. and p.m. peak
hour turning movement volumes at the study intersections were increased to turning movement
volumes in the Cumulative (2035) year.

In summary, in the Cumulative (2035) No Project scenario,

          The following intersections are expected to perform below the applicable level of service
           standards:
               o 4th Street & K Street;

               o 4th Street & L Street; and,
               o 5th Street & K Street.
         None of the unsignalized study intersections met signal warrants.
         The following intersections had 95th percentile queues that exceeded the available storage:
               o 4th Street & H Street;
               o 4th Street & J Street;
               o 5th Street & H Street;
               o 5th Street & J Street; and,
               o 5th Street & L Street.
         All other intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily.


Cumulative (2035) Plus Phase 2 (Total Build-Out) Conditions
With the addition of Phase 2 (Total Build-Out) project traffic to the Cumulative scenario,

         The following intersections are expected to perform below the applicable level of service
          standards:
             o 4th Street & K Street;
             o 4th Street & L Street; and,
             o 5th Street & K Street.
         The project’s impacts were found to be significant at the above three intersections. Mitigation
          measures to reduce the project’s impacts to less than significant are summarized in Table 1.
         All other intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily.
         None of the unsignalized study intersections met signal warrants.
         The following intersections had 95th percentile queues that exceeded the available storage:
               o 4th Street & H Street;
               o 4th Street & J Street;
               o 5th Street & H Street;
               o 5th Street & J Street; and,
               o 5th Street & L Street.
The project will not significantly impact bicycle and pedestrian circulation. Although not required as
mitigation for the project, after review of the existing conditions the following recommendations have
been developed to improve bicycle and pedestrian circulation. It’s recommended that ADA
improvements be made to the curb ramps at the study intersections in the project vicinity and possible
routes for potential north-south bicycle lanes be explored to provide a marked bicycle facility across the
US 101 couplet (4th and 5th streets). Additionally, to address estimated 95th percentile queues exceeding
available storage, the City and Caltrans should explore signal re-timing possibilities and improved signal
coordination along 4th Street and 5th Street.

INTRODUCTION

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The proposed Humboldt County Community Corrections Reentry Resource Center (HCCCRRC) and New
County Office Facility constitute an ultimately 80,000 square feet expansion to the existing Humboldt
County Courthouse and Jail Complex in the City of Eureka bounded by 4th Street to the north, 5th Street
to the south, K Street to the east and the existing Humboldt County Jail to the west. Phase 1 of
HCCCRRC would consist of a 37 employees. And in Phase 2 (total build-out), the New County Office
Facility would add an additional 77 employees, for a total of 114 new employees.


STUDY AREA
Existing and future overall peak hour traffic conditions were evaluated at fourteen intersections that
would most likely be impacted by the project. The following intersection locations were studied:

          1.        4th Street (US 101) & H Street
          2.        4th Street (US 101) & I Street
          3.        4th Street (US 101) & J Street
          4.        4th Street (US 101) & K Street
          5.        4th Street (US 101) & L Street
          6.        5th Street (US 101) & H Street
          7.        5th Street (US 101) & I Street
          8.        5th Street (US 101) & J Street
          9.        5th Street (US 101) & K Street
          10.       5th Street (US 101) & L Street
          11.       6th Street & H Street
          12.       6th Street & I Street
          13.       7th Street & H Street
          14.       7th Street & I Street

The study intersections were evaluated against the standards set forth by the City of Eureka and
Caltrans.

Traffic conditions at the intersections were analyzed for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours of
traffic. The a.m. peak hour is typically between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and the p.m. peak hour is
typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM.

Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:

                                                                     14

Scenario 1:         Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from recent traffic counts.

Scenario 2:         Existing Plus Project Conditions (Phases 1 and 2). Project generated traffic volumes were
                    added to the Existing traffic volumes. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated
                    relative to existing conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

Scenario 3:         Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative Conditions traffic volumes were developed using a
                    growth rate for the city provided by the City of Eureka.

Scenario 4:         Cumulative Plus Project Conditions (Phase 2). Project generated traffic volumes were
                    added to the cumulative traffic volumes. Cumulative plus project conditions were
                    evaluated relative to cumulative conditions in order to determine potential cumulative
                    project impacts.

Southern Humboldt Intercity Transit routes. These stops provide good transit connectivity to the
project both locally and to the greater Humboldt region.


EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
The existing traffic volume levels in the vicinity of the project were determined by collecting a.m. and
p.m. peak hour turning movement counts at the fourteen study intersections. The traffic counts were
collected on July 15, 2014, which according to the City of Eureka and Caltrans District 1 staff represents
a higher traffic-volume condition due to seasonal, summer visitor/vacationing traffic. Figure 3 shows
the turning movement counts as well as the existing geometries and controls at the study intersections
for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODOLOGY
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative indication of the level of delay and congestion experienced by
motorists using an intersection. Levels of service are designated by the letters A through F, with A being
the best conditions and F being the worst (high delay and congestion). The City of Eureka considers LOS
A through C to be acceptable operating conditions for intersections within the City’s jurisdiction.
Caltrans considers LOS A through C to be acceptable operating conditions for state highway facilities.

The following intersections lie within the City of Eureka’s jurisdiction, and therefore, LOS C is acceptable
for these intersections:

         6th Street & H Street
         6th Street & I Street
         7th Street & H Street
         7th Street & I Street

The following intersections and roadway segments lie within the jurisdiction of Caltrans, and therefore,
LOS C is also acceptable for these intersections:

         4th Street (US 101) & H Street
         4th Street (US 101) & I Street
         4th Street (US 101) & J Street
         4th Street (US 101) & K Street
         4th Street (US 101) & L Street
         5th Street (US 101) & H Street
         5th Street (US 101) & I Street
         5th Street (US 101) & J Street
         5th Street (US 101) & K Street
         5th Street (US 101) & L Street
The methods used for the analyses are described below.


Signalized Intersection Analysis
All signalized intersections (those controlled by traffic signals) were analyzed using the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 signalized intersection methodology. This procedure calculates an
average stopped delay per vehicle at a signalized intersection, and assigns a level of service designation
based upon the delay. Table 2 presents the HCM 2010 delay and level of service definitions. Existing
signal phasing and timing plans were obtained from the City of Eureka and Caltrans for all signalized
intersections. These plans were used for the existing and existing plus project scenarios. Optimized
timings were assumed for all cumulative scenarios.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
At an unsignalized intersection, most of the major street traffic is not delayed, and by definition have
acceptable conditions. The major street left-turn movements and the minor street movements are all
susceptible to delay of varying degrees. Generally, the higher the major street traffic volumes, the
higher the delay for the minor movements.

Two-Way Stop Controlled (TWSC) Intersection Analysis: Non-signalized TWSC intersection analyses
were conducted using the operational methodology outlined in the HCM 2010. This procedure
calculates an average stopped delay per vehicle for each movement and assigns a level of service
designation based upon the minor leg’s worst movement’s average delay. For the intersection of 5th
Street & K Street, microsimulation was used to evaluate level of service given the effect of an adjacent
upstream signalized intersection (5th Street & J Street) that is not taken into account in the HCM 2010
procedure which assumes steady-state conditions where demand is constant. Microsimulation is able
to capture the real effect of vehicles platooning from signalization that results in gaps in traffic flow that
allow vehicles to enter from a nearby, downstream side-stop-controlled intersection with less delay.
The average total delay per vehicle from the simulation output is reported for the side-stop controlled
intersection of 5th Street & K Street. HCM 2010 definitions for delay and level of service at unsignalized
intersections are shown in Table 3.

SIGNAL WARRANTS
Unsignalized intersections were evaluated using the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) in the
Caltrans Traffic Manual. Non-signalized intersections shown to trigger the peak hour signal warrant are
identified in this analysis for discussion purposes. However, the decision to install a traffic signal should
not be based solely upon a single warrant. The additional eight other warrants should be examined as
well.

Warrant 3 addresses peak hour traffic volume levels above which it is presumed that the need for a
traffic signal is warranted. Traffic signals tend to reduce the potential for right-angle type collisions but
also tend to increase the potential for less severe read-end collisions. Signal warrant peak hour volumes
represent the threshold point at which the potential for more rear-end collisions is offset by the
potential for fewer more severe right-angle collisions.

All unsignalized intersections were evaluated using total approach volumes. Where signal warrants
were met with total approach volume, right turn volumes were reduced if a dedicated right turn only
lane was present in accordance with the California MUTCD. A common approach to determining the
amount of the reduction involves subtracting 85% of the right turn lane’s capacity from the number of
right turns on the approach. If the result is less than or equal to zero, no right turns are included in the
warrant for that approach.


QUEUE ANALYSIS
Queue lengths were examined to determine if available intersection approach storage capacity is
adequate. Queues were evaluated based on 95th percentile queues estimated using Synchro and
compared with the available storage capacity.


IMPACT SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

City of Eureka
According to the traffic impact study guidelines received from the City of Eureka, the following are
thresholds of significance, which are used to determine if an impact is significant and requires
mitigation.

For unsignalized and signalized intersections, a project is considered to have a significant effect if it
would:

         degrade an intersection operating at an acceptable LOS (A, B, or C) to deteriorate to an
          unacceptable LOS (D, E, or F); or,
         if intersections affected by increased project traffic are already below LOS C and the added
          project traffic results in an additional delay of 5 seconds added to the intersection.

                                                                     25

Caltrans
Per Caltrans guidelines2, Caltrans endeavors to maintain a target LOS at the transition between LOS “C”
and LOS “D” on State highway facilities. This is the case of SR 101 (4th Street and 5th Street) going
through the City of Eureka.

LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS

Intersection
Table 4 presents the results of the level of service analysis for the Existing (No Project) conditions. The
following intersections are expected to perform below the applicable level of service standards:

          4th Street & K Street; and,
          4th Street & L Street.

All other study intersections were found to be operating at an acceptable level of service. LOS
worksheets for the Existing No Project Scenario are provided in Appendix 2.

The California MUTCD Peak Hour Signal Warrant (#3) was used for the signal warrant analysis.



INTERSECTION CRASH EVALUATION
Crash data were obtained and reviewed for each of the study intersections. The data were collected
from California Highway Patrol’s Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) using the
database years between 2009 and 2013.

During the last five consecutive year period, there were a total of 192 crashes that occurred at the
study intersections. Of which, more than 20 crashes occurred at 3 study intersections (#11-13) and less
than 10 crashes occurred at 5 intersections (#2,3,6,7,9). The number of crashes by severity type
occurred at each intersection is shown in Table 6 and their crash rates are shown in Figure 4.


                                                                     28

The intersection crash rate was calculated using the following equation:

                                                                   𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝑟𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑠 × 1,000,000
         𝐶𝑟𝑎𝑠ℎ 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 (𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑣𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠) =
                                                             𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 × 365 × 𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒

The daily traffic volume was obtained from a conversion from peak hour to daily volume. It can be
typically assumed that the a.m. peak hour volume accounts for 8% of daily volume and the p.m. peak
hour volume accounts for 10% of daily volume. The following intersections experienced relatively
higher total crash rate than the others:

          Intersection #11 – 6th Street and H Street (0.90 crashes per million vehicles)
          Intersection #12 – 6th Street and I Street (1.10 crashes per million vehicles)
          Intersection #13 – 7th Street and H Street (0.98 crashes per million vehicles)
          Intersection #14 – 7th Street and I Street (0.87 crashes per million vehicles)

All other study intersections had less than 0.40 crashes per million vehicles. There was no fatality crash
observed at any of the study intersections. In addition, the intersection #14 was found to have the
highest injury crash rate (0.55 crashes per million vehicles) compared to others.

Figure 5 shows a summary for crashes by collision type and Table 7 presents the three most common
collision types occurred at each of the study intersections. A broadside collision was found to be the
most frequent incident type at 10 out of 14 intersections (#1, #4-7, and #10-14) regardless of their
control type. This collision type typically occurs when a driver runs a stop sign or a red light into an
intersection. In addition, other two collision types, sideswipe and rear end collisions were also found to
be the most common types at the intersections #2, #3, and #9 (for sideswipe) and at the intersections
#4-5 and #8 (for rear end). Other collision types occurred at the study intersections include vehicle-
pedestrian, overturned, hitting-object, and head-on.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Crash Evaluation
In addition, bicycle and pedestrian crashes were evaluated separately to determine any bicycle- or
pedestrian-specific safety concerns at any of the study intersections. Table 8 provides a summary of
pedestrian and bicycle crashes for the 14 study intersections. None of the intersections reported a
bicyclist or pedestrian fatality over the time period evaluated. There were a total of 11 pedestrian
injuries, with four of those injuries occurring at the 4th Street & H Street intersection. Both the 4th Street
& H Street and the 4th Street & L Street intersections had three pedestrian crashes. Only three
intersections had bicycle crashes and those crashes only resulted in one reported bicyclist injury at the
4th Street & I Street intersection.

Bicycle and pedestrian volumes were collected as part of the turning movement counts used to
evaluate vehicular level of service. Volumes for pedestrians and bicyclists for the count collection
periods are shown below in Table 9. The intersection of 4th Street & J Street had the highest pedestrian
volumes, with 168 pedestrians crossing the intersection during the a.m. count period (7:00 a.m. to 9:00
p.m.) and 84 during the p.m. count period (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m). Very few bicyclists were observed
through the 14 study intersections, with the intersections of 5th Street & K Street and 7th Street & I
Street both having five total bicyclists observed during the two count periods. Given this volume
information, the concentration of pedestrian crashes at the intersections of 4th & H Street and 4th Street
& L Street stands out given the lower relative pedestrian activity at these intersections, especially at the
intersection of 4th Street & L Street.

INTERSECTION SIGHT DISTANCE EVALUATION
Sight distance at the three unsignalized intersections was evaluated using guidance from the AASHTO
2011 A Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets, 6th Edition. AASHTO values often serve as
the minimum design requirements for transportation agencies, and are used in this study to represent
minimum design dimension and speed guidance for sight distance.

Intersection Sight Distance (ISD) is defined in AASHTO as “the sight distance… at intersections to allow
the drivers of stopped vehicles a sufficient view of the intersecting highway to decide when to enter the
intersecting highway or cross it.” Additionally, AASHTO recommends that,

      [t]he driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection should have an unobstructed view of the entire intersection,
      including any traffic-control devices, and sufficient lengths along the intersecting highway to permit the driver
      to anticipate and avoid potential collisions. The sight distance needed under various assumptions of physical
      conditions and driver behavior is directly related to vehicle speeds and to the resultant distances traversed
      during perception-reaction time and braking.

ISD was calculated for a stopped passenger vehicle turning left from the minor road (Case B1), turning
right from the minor road (Case B2), and crossing major road (Case B3). AAHSTO defines intersection
sight distance (ISD) for “Case B – Intersections with Stop Control on the Minor Road” as the sight

                                                                     33

distance required to allow minor-road vehicle operators to proceed safely without forcing a major-road
vehicle to stop.

The ISD evaluation was conducted based on field and aerial map surveys as shown in Figures 1 through
3. The required ISD values were based on a passenger vehicle as the design vehicle with speed equals to
the posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour (mph) on major road (Vmajor).

Following AASHTO, the time gap (tg) required for left-turn, right-turn, and through movements are 7.5,
6.5, and 7.5 seconds (6.5 + (2 x 0.5)), respectively. For example, a driver in a passenger vehicle turning
left from a stop to major road with a speed of 30 mph would require approximately 335 feet of
intersection sight distance to decide when to enter the major road (ISD = 1.47Vmajortg).

The range of available sight lines was established by considering the decision point of the departure
vehicle from a stopped position. The decision point distance is typically measured along minor road
between the driver’s eyes of the stopped vehicle and the edge of the major-road traveled way, which is
typically 14.5 ft. A departure sight triangle (Figure 6) was determined for each approach of the minor
road as shown in Figure 7 through Figure 9, where the clear sight line required to meet AASHTO
guidance (in yellow) and the available sight line (in red) are shown on each figure. The intersection sight
distance along the major road is identified by distance “b” in Figure 6.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
To develop the Existing Plus Project traffic conditions, the traffic generated by the proposed project is
added to the Existing traffic volumes. Existing Plus Project conditions are compared relative to the
Existing conditions to determine the potential impacts due to the proposed project.


Project Traffic
The project’s traffic impacts were estimated in this section by considering the amount of traffic to be
generated by the project and the directional distribution of that traffic. The project site is proposed to
have one access point mid-block on K Street between 4th and 5th Streets.


TRIP GENERATION
The projected weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour vehicle trip ends for the proposed development were
based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. The rates used in the a.m. and p.m. weekday
analysis are presented in Table 11 and Table 12, respectively.

Using these rates, during the normal weekday a.m. and p.m. commute peak hours the Proposed Project
is expected to generate a total of 20 a.m. peak hour trips (17 inbound and 3 outbound) and 23 p.m.
peak hour trips (7 inbound and 16 outbound) during Phase 1. During Phase 2 (Total Build-out), the
proposed HCCCRRC and New County Office Facility are estimated to generate a total of 67 a.m. peak
hour trips (58 inbound and 9 outbound) and 84 p.m. peak hour trips (26 inbound and 58 outbound). At
total build-out, the entire proposed project generates a maximum of 791 daily trips (ITE daily trip rate
of 7.75 per employee for government office complex). Table 13 and Table 14 present the trip
generation by peak hour for each phase of the project.

Trip Distribution
To evaluate the traffic related effects of the project, trips that would be generated by the project were
distributed onto the roadway network. Trip distribution simulates the circulation pattern of travel, by
matching trips generated by one type of land use (e.g., residential) with trips generated by other types
of land uses (e.g., employment, shopping, and education). Trip distribution patterns to and from the
proposed project were estimated by evaluating the existing roadway network, existing travel patterns
from counts, nearby population centers, and current land use patterns. Trip distribution patterns for
inbound and outbound trips are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11. Figure 12 presents the project’s
turning movement volumes at the study intersections for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours under Phase 1
conditions. Figure 13 presents the project’s turning movement volumes at the study intersections for
the a.m. and p.m. peak hours under Phase 2 conditions.

LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Existing Plus Project intersection peak hour volumes for Phase 1 and Phase 2 were computed as the
sum of the Existing peak hour volumes and Project Only peak hour volumes for Phase 1 and Phase 2,
respectively. Figure 14 and Figure 15 present the peak hour volumes including the project trips for each
respective phase. Table 15 and Table 16 present the level of service at the study intersections under
Existing Plus Project conditions for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 scenarios, respectively.

The following intersections are expected to perform below the applicable level of service standards
under Existing Plus Project Phase 1 and Phase 2 conditions:

         4th Street & K Street; and,
         4th Street & L Street.

All other study intersections were found to be operating at an acceptable level of service. LOS
worksheets for the Existing Plus Project Scenarios are provided in Appendix 3.

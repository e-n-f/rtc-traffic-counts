EXPLANATIONS

QTb - Boring Lavas (Pliocene to Pleistocene) ­ Light-gray to gray, diktytaxitic, olivine- (less commonly
plagioclase-) phyric basalt and basaltic andesite flows erupted from a series of local vents. Eruptive
activity associated with Boring lavas build cones (e.g., Mount Sylvania and Cooks Butte) composed of
interstratified cinders and lava. Boring lava flows are poorly exposed due to variable degrees of deep
weathering and/or mantling by loess. Exceptions occur where catastrophic flood waters have eroded
away overlying deposits or in excavations. Boring lava flows typically display blocky to columnar jointing
and, if preserve, vesicular flow tops. Thickness of unit QTb is highly variable, ranging from >600 ft at a
vent to <50 ft for individual flows away from the vent. Age of unit QTb within the map area is poorly
constrained; reversed magnetic polarity of all sampled flows within the map area (based on portable
fluxgate magnetometer determinations) indicate an age of >700,000 years. Boring flows can be

distinguished from older basalt units on the basis of physical appearance, stratigraphic position,
lithology, and major oxide composition (Table 1)
Columbia River Basalt Group (middle Miocene) ­ Miocene tholeiitic flood-basalt flows that were
erupted from long linear fissure systems in northeastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and western
Idaho from approximately 17 to 6 Ma (Swanson and others, 1979; Hooper, 1982). Many individual flows
are known to be huge in size, often covering thousands to tens of thousands of square miles and ranging
from hundreds to thousands of cubic miles in volume (Tolan and others, 1989). These flows entered
western Oregon via a wide gap in the northern Oregon Miocene Cascade Range (Beeson and others,
1985; Beeson and Tolan, in press); some flows even reached the Pacific Ocean (Beeson and others,
1979). Significant differences and variations in the geochemical, paleomagnetic, and lithological
properties of Columbia River Basalt Group flows allow this series of flood-basalt flows to be formally
divided into five formations (Swanson and others, 1979) and also enable these formations to be further
subdivided into a host of mappable members and units (Swanson and others, 1979; Beeson and others,
1985, Reidel and others, 1989). Members and units belonging to the Wanapum and Grande Ronde
Basalts, two of the five Columbia River Basalt Group formations, are present within the map area and
have a collective thickness ranging up to >670 ft

Tfsh - Basalt of Sand Hollow (middle Miocene) ­ Four flows are present within the map area. Flows
typically are blocky to columnar jointed, but occasionally display entablature/colonnade jointing style.
Fresh exposures are dark gray to black; weathered surfaces are typically greenish gray to black. The
three oldest flows ("+3, +4, and +5" units of Beeson and others [1975]) are find to coarse grained,
occasionally diktytaxitic, and sparsely plagioclase phyric, with phenocrysts <2 cm in size. The youngest
Sand Hollow flow is typically diktytaxitic, medium to coarse grained, and plagioclase phyric, with
phenocrysts and glomerocrysts that commonly range from 2 to 5 cm in size. Unit thickness is variable,
ranging from <50 to >200 ft. Sand Hollow flows can e distinguished from both the Sentinel Gap and
Ginkgo flows on the combined basis of stratigraphic position, lithology, and composition (Table 1). Both
low- to intermediate-P2O5 compositional types (Beeson and others, 1985) are present within the map
area. Beeson and others (1985) report a K0Ar date of 15.3 Ma for this unit

Tfg - Basalt of Ginkgo (middle Miocene) ­ Two flows are present within the map area. Flows are
commonly blocky to columnar jointed, often displaying well-formed prismatic colonnades. Fresh
exposures are dark gray to black; weathered surfaces are commonly reddish brown to gray. Both flows
are typically medium-grained, plagioclase-microphyric basalt, with laths <0.1 cm in size, and abundantly
plagioclase phyric, with phenocrysts and glomerocrysts ranging from 0.3 to 2 cm in size. The upper
Ginkgo flow is commonly diktytaxitic. Thickness of this unit varies from 50 to >200 ft within the map
area. Ginkgo flows can be distinguished from plagioclase-phyric Sand Hollow flow on the combined basis
of stratigraphic positions, composition (Table 1), and excursional paleomagnetic polarity (Beeson and
others, 1985). This unit commonly overlies a thin (commonly approximately 1-ft-thick), discontinuous,
sedimentary interbed that ranges from fluvial arkosic, micaceous sandstone to paleosol. This sediment is
equivalent to the Vantage Member of the Ellensburg Formation (Swanson and others, 1979; Beeson and
others, 1985) and is not shown here as a separate map unit because of its relative thinness

Tgsb - Grande Ronde Basalt (middle Miocene), Sentinel Bluffs unit (middle Miocene) ­ Within the map
area, two flows that were formerly designated as "-1 and -2 flows" of Beeson and Moran (1979) are
present. Flows typically display blocky to columnar jointing and rarely display an entablature/colonnade
jointing pattern. Fresh exposures are light to dark gray; weathered surfaces are greenish gray to dark
gray. The lower flow is typically fine- to medium-grained basalt and sparsely plagioclase phyric, with
small (<0.5 cm) tabular plagioclase phenocrysts. The upper flow is fine to medium grained, commonly

diktytaxitic, and aphyric. Unit thickness ranges from 25 to 150 ft within the map area. Sentinel Bluffs
flows are distinguished from both younger Frenchman Springs units and older Grande Ronde units on
the basis of stratigraphic position, composition (Table 1), lithology, and normal paleomagnetic polarity
(see Reidel and others, 1989; Beeson and others, 1989). Long and Duncan (1982) report a 40Ar/29Ar date
of approximately 15.6 Ma for the youngest flows of this unit on the Columbia Plateau

Tgww - Winter Water unit (middle Miocene) ­ Within the map area, two flows that were formerly
designated as the "-3 flow" of Beeson and others (1975) or "N2 low-MgO flows" of Beeson and Moran
(1979) are present. Winter Water flows display a wide range of jointing patterns, from columnar to
entablature/colonnade. Fresh exposures are dark gray to black; weathered surfaces are greenish gray to
grayish black. Both flows are typically glassy to fine grained and phyric to abundantly phyric, with small
(<0.3 cm) plagioclase glomerocrysts that often display a distinctive radial or spoke-shaped habit.
Distribution of glomerocrysts is often uneven and tends to be less abundant in the basal portion of the
flow. Unit thickness ranges from 25 to 100 ft within the map area. Winter Water flows are distinguished
from other Grande Ronde units on the basis of lithology, composition (Table 1), stratigraphic position,
and normal paleomagnetic polarity (see Reidel and others, 1989; Beeson and others, 1989)

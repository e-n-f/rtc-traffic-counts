1.       INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Study (TIS) for the Autobahn Motors
Showroom Expansion Project, located at 700 Island Parkway, in Belmont, California (Project). This chapter
discusses the TIS purpose, analysis methods, criteria used to identify significant impacts, and report
organization.



STUDY PURPOSE

The study's purpose is to evaluate the potential transportation impacts of the Autobahn Motors
Expansion. The Project site is located within the City Belmont in San Mateo County, as shown on Figure 1.
The Project proposes to modify the existing site by adding approximately 5,400 square feet of sales
floor/office space and removing nine of the 27 vehicle service bays. A conceptual site plan is shown on
Figure 2. Autobahn Motors also owns and operates a service center located at 500 Harbor Boulevard, in
unincorporated San Mateo County. The service center is also undergoing a separate reconfiguration to
increase the number of service bays. Under both existing and proposed conditions, all customers for sales
and service access the sales site on Island Parkway. Some vehicles remain at the sales site for service, while
most are shuttled to the service site on Harbor Boulevard. The general operations between the two sites
will be retained; however, with a reduction in service bays at the sales site, it is anticipated that
proportionately fewer vehicles would be serviced there, and thus more vehicles would be shuttled to the
service site.

This study addresses the Project's impacts on the roadway system under two scenarios (Existing Plus
Project and Cumulative Plus Project) and discusses the adjacent bicycle, pedestrian, and transit network. A
site plan review and a sight distance analysis were also conducted.



STUDY LOCATIONS AND ANALYSIS SCENARIOS

Project impacts to study area roadway facilities were determined by measuring the effect Project traffic
would have on intersection operations in the vicinity of the site during the weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00
AM) and weekday evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak periods. The weekday peak periods were chosen for
analysis because these are typically the periods with highest adjacent roadway traffic and highest trip
generation potential. Weekend peak periods are occasionally considered for analysis where Project-
related trips may be significantly higher and adjacent roadway traffic may also be high. For this study, we

                                                                                                             1

looked at weekday peak periods only, and did not include a weekend peak period analysis. The analysis
periods were selected with input from City of Belmont staff. A weekend peak period was not studied
because of the much lower vehicle volumes on adjacent roadways and the more sporadic nature of
Project-related trips on a weekend as opposed to a weekday (i.e. trips are much more spread-out during a
weekend day and therefore the effects of one peak hour would likely be minimal). The following
intersections, as shown on Figure 1, were selected based on a review of the project location, the amount
of traffic that could be added to the intersections in the vicinity of the site, and consultation with City staff:

         1.   Project Driveway / Island Parkway

         2.   Ralston Avenue / Marine Parkway / Island Parkway / US 101 Northbound (NB) Ramps

         3.   Ralston Avenue / US 101 Southbound (SB) Ramps

         4.   Ralston Avenue / Old County Road

         5.   Ralston Avenue / El Camino Real

         6.   Harbor Boulevard / Old County Road

The following US 101 freeway segments were also analyzed:

         1.   North of the Ralston Avenue/Marine Parkway interchange

         2.   Between the Ralston Avenue/Marine Parkway and Harbor Boulevard interchanges

         3.   South of the Harbor Boulevard interchange

For this study, the following scenarios were evaluated:

Existing ­ Existing (2013) conditions based on recent traffic counts

Existing Plus Project ­ Existing (2013) conditions plus Project-related traffic

Cumulative Without Project ­ Future forecast conditions, which considers local and regional traffic
growth

Cumulative Plus Project ­ Future forecast conditions plus Project-related traffic

ANALYSIS METHODS

The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term "level of service" (LOS). LOS is a
qualitative description of traffic flow from a vehicle driver's perspective based on factors such as speed,
travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels of service are defined ranging from LOS A (best
operating conditions) to LOS F (worst operating conditions). LOS E corresponds to operations "at
capacity." When volumes exceed capacity, stop-and-go conditions result and operations are designated
as LOS F.


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

Traffic conditions at signalized intersections were evaluated using the method documented in Chapter 16
of the Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The HCM method
calculates control delay at an intersection based on inputs such as traffic volumes, lane geometry, signal
phasing and timing, pedestrian crossing times, and peak hour factors. Control delay is defined as the
delay directly associated with the traffic control device (i.e., a stop sign or a traffic signal) and specifically
includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. These
delay estimates are considered meaningful indicators of driver discomfort and frustration, fuel
consumption, and lost travel time. The relationship between average control delay, driver's perception of
traffic, and LOS for signalized intersections is summarized in Table 1. The City of Belmont Guidelines for
Traffic Impact Studies (City of Belmont, 2012) does not define a specific acceptable level of service for
signalized intersections, but does specify a series of significance thresholds which are described later.
Many communities select LOS D as the threshold for acceptable operations, where LOS E would be
unacceptable.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

For unsignalized (all-way stop-controlled and side-street stop-controlled) study intersections, the
Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method for unsignalized
intersections was used. With this method, operations are defined by the average control delay per vehicle
(measured in seconds). The control delay incorporates delay associated with deceleration, acceleration,
stopping, and moving up in queue. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for
unsignalized intersections. At side-street stop-controlled intersections, the delay is calculated for each
stop-controlled movement, the left-turn movement from the major street, as well as the intersection
average. The intersection average delay and highest movement/approach delay are reported for side-
street stop-controlled intersections. The City of Belmont Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies generally

FREEWAY SEGMENTS

Traffic conditions on freeway segments (basic, merge, and diverge) near the Project site were evaluated
using the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology. Service levels on each segment are
determined based on vehicle density and volume to capacity ratios, as calculated using the freeway
volumes and the ramp volumes at each study location. Some on- and off-ramps are modeled as basic
segments when a lane is added to the mainline as a continuation of the on-ramp lane. The operating
characteristics of segments are described using the concept of LOS. Table 3 summarizes the LOS criteria
for basic segments, while Table 4 summarizes the LOS criteria for merge and diverge segments.

REGULATORY SETTING CITY OF BELMONT

The Belmont General Plan 1982 serves as the blueprint for the City's future growth and development. The
Circulation Element of the General Plan does not include any new major roadways or changes to the
existing system. The General Plan's transportation goal is:

    Goal 2: To accommodate each mode of transportation on a route designed and located to provide
    for the enjoyment and safety of the individual and to cause minimum interference with adjacent uses
    of land


CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (CALTRANS)

Caltrans is the state agency responsible for the construction, maintenance, and operation of interstate
freeways, freeway ramps, and state highways in California. Within the Project study area, Caltrans manages
US-101 and State Route 82 (El Camino Real). Fehr & Peers coordinated with Caltrans to collect signal
timing data for study intersections located on these facilities.


REGIONAL AGENCIES

The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is a regional planning agency consisting of members of
all nine counties and 101 cities within the Bay Area. The agency determines coordinated policies, provides
service programs (such as financing, risk management, and employee training), and advocates for
beneficial legislation. In collaboration with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, ABAG developed
the Bay Area's first Sustainable Communities Strategy, called Plan Bay Area, which is a long-range,
integrated transportation and land use strategy that was approved in July 2013.The Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC) serves as the transportation planning, coordinating, and financing
agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. In April 2009, the MTC adopted the Transportation
2035 Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area, which specifies how some $218 billion in anticipated federal,
state and local transportation funds will be spent in the nine-county Bay Area during the next 25 years.
The vision for Transportation 2035 is to support a prosperous and globally competitive Bay Area
economy, provide for a healthy and safe environment, and promote equitable mobility opportunities for
all residents. More recently, the MTC worked with ABAG to develop the Plan Bay Area Sustainable
Communities Strategy as required by SB 375.

The City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo County (C/CAG) is a county-level planning
agency consisting of members of all cities within San Mateo County. The agency studies issues that affect
quality of life (transportation, air quality, waste, etc.) and is the Congestion Management Agency for the

County. C/CAG recently published its 2013 Congestion Management Plan, which was developed to be
consistent with the recently adopted Plan Bay Area.



SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

The following transportation and circulation significance criteria are based on the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines and the City of Belmont Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies (May 2012). The
CEQA Guidelines specify that a project would have a significant traffic and circulation impact if it:

Causes an increase in traffic which is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and capacity of the
street system (i.e., results in substantial increase in either the number of vehicle trips and/or the volume to
capacity ratio on roads, or congestion at intersections), or

Exceeds, either individually or cumulatively, a level of service standard established for designated roads or
highways.

Since the Project lies within City jurisdiction and many of the transportation facilities that may be affected
lie within the city, the City of Belmont's impact criteria will be used to assess the Project's impacts.

The City of Belmont Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies includes traffic level of service standards for
signalized and unsignalized intersections. These criteria and interpretations are presented below.


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

The Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies defines a series of significant impact thresholds for signalized
intersections based on a combination of increases in control delay and the demand to capacity (V/C) ratio,
which are summarized in Table 5.

Notes:
    1. As defined in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (Transportation Research Board, 2000).
    2. Signalized Intersections: If the addition of project traffic results in a reduction (rather than an increase) in intersection
          control delay, evaluation should then consider significant if 35 or more project vehicle trips are added to an intersection
          operating at LOS E, or 20 or more project vehicle trips are added to an intersection operating at LOS F.


UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

All-Way Stop Intersections

The citywide LOS standard from the Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies for all-way stop sign controlled
intersections is LOS D. The City has also developed a series of significance thresholds for unsignalized
intersections based on average control delay, summarized in Table 6.

Side Street Stop Intersections

The citywide LOS standard from the Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies for side street stop sign
controlled intersections is LOS D, though the significance thresholds in Table 6 also apply. The guidelines
also state that the criteria do not apply to low volume roadways, though it does not specify when a
roadway is considered "low volume."

OTHER INTERSECTION-LEVEL CRITERIA

The Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies also state that there would be a significant impact at an
intersection if:

     ·    The project traffic causes the intersection to meet or exceed Caltrans signal warrant criteria. For
          intersections that already exceed signal warrant criteria, project traffic increases the V/C ratio by
          0.01.

     ·    The project traffic increases volumes to a level meeting or exceeding criteria for provision of a
          right or left-turn lane on an intersection approach. For intersections that already exceed turn lane
          warrant criteria, project traffic increases peak hour volume by more than 1%.

     ·    The project creates or adds to an existing unsignalized intersection such that it does not have
          adequate sight lines based upon Caltrans criteria and/or criteria for City intersections.

     ·    The project traffic creates vehicle queues exceeding turn lane capacity or causes problematic
          back-ups of traffic on driveways or roadways on or off the project site. For intersections where
          this is already occurring, project traffic increases vehicle queues by 1%


OTHER SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

In addition to the criteria listed above, the Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies define specific significance
criteria for On-Site Roads and Frontage Improvements, Parking, Emergency Access, Policies and Plans, and
Road Hazards.

On-Site Roads and Frontage Improvements

The guidelines define on-site roads and frontage improvement impacts as significant if the proposed on-
site circulation would not meet the City's minimum standards for roadway or driveway design, or, in the
opinion of the registered traffic engineer conducting the study, results in safety hazards to pedestrians,
bicyclists or vehicles.

Parking

The guidelines define parking impacts as significant if the project's proposed on-site vehicle or bicycle
parking supply would not be adequate to accommodate demand based upon City code criteria.

Emergency Access

The guidelines define emergency access impacts as significant if the project site would have inadequate
emergency access.

Policies and Plans

The guidelines define policy and plan impacts as significant if the project would conflict with adopted
policies, plans, or programs.

Road Hazards

The guidelines define road hazard impacts as significant if the project would substantially increase
hazards to pedestrians, bicyclists or vehicles due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous
intersections) or incompatible uses.


FREEWAY SEGMENTS

The Belmont Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies do not specify formal guidelines for freeway significance
criteria. However, C/CAG's Congestion Management Program (2013) specifies a LOS standard of E for US-
101 within the Project area. In addition, C/CAG's Policy on Traffic Impact Analysis (2006) provides the
following guidelines for determining significant traffic impacts on freeway segments:

For freeway segments currently in compliance with the adopted LOS standard:

    ·    A project is considered to have a CMP impact if the project will cause the freeway segment to
         operate at a level of service that violates the standard adopted in the current Congestion
         Management Program (CMP).


                                                                                                           13
Transportation Impact Study for Belmont Autobahn Motors Expansion
March 2014




     ·   A project will be considered to have a CMP impact if the cumulative analysis indicates that the
         combination of the proposed project and future cumulative traffic demand will result in the
         freeway segment to operate at a level of service that violates the standard adopted in the current
         Congestion Management Program (CMP) and the proposed project increases traffic demand on
         the freeway segment by an amount equal to one (1) percent or more of the segment capacity, or
         causes the freeway segment volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio to increase by one (1) percent.

For freeway segments currently not in compliance with the adopted LOS standard:

     ·   A project is considered to have a CMP impact if the project will add traffic demand equal to one
         (1) percent or more of the segment capacity or causes the freeway segment volume-to-capacity
         (v/c) ratio to increase by one (1) percent, if the freeway segment is currently not in compliance
         with the adopted LOS standard.

2.      EXISTING CONDITIONS

This chapter describes the transportation facilities in the Project study area, including the surrounding
roadway network, as well as transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities. Existing intersection and freeway
segment operations are also described.



ROADWAY SYSTEM

The Project site is located on the west side of Island Parkway north of the Ralston Avenue/US-101
interchange. The site is connected to US-101 via both Island Parkway and the major east-west segment of
Ralston Avenue/Marine Parkway. Ralston Avenue also provides connections to local office and residential
areas, as well as the Belmont Caltrain Station. Additional roadways that intersect with Ralston Avenue
within the study area include El Camino Real and Old County Road. Harbor Boulevard, located south of
and parallel to Ralston Avenue, is also included in the study area since it provides access to the off-site
service center for Autobahn Motors.

US-101 is located west of and adjacent to the site and is a major north-south freeway that provides
regional access. The freeway extends southward to San Jose and beyond and northward to San Francisco
and beyond. Near Ralston Avenue, US-101 provides four travel lanes in each direction, with auxiliary lanes
in both the northbound and southbound directions. An interchange at Ralston Avenue/Marine Parkway
provides access from US-101 to the Project site. The posted speed limit is 55 mph. A bicycle/pedestrian
bridge crosses US-101 just north of the Ralston Avenue/Marine Parkway interchange, providing access to
the Bay Trail multiuse path east of the Project site.

Island Parkway is a north-south four-lane roadway with a center median and a posted speed limit of 30
mph. Island Parkway extends from the Ralston Avenue interchange with US-101 and terminates north of
the Project site at Concourse Place. Island Parkway serves as the primary access route from US-101 to the
Project site. Island Parkway is designated as a Class II bicycle facility (bike lanes) north of the Project Site.

Ralston Avenue is an east-west four-lane arterial roadway with a center median in most locations within
the study area. The posted speed limit is 30 to 35 mph. On-street parking is provided on both sides of the
street in most areas between Furlong Street and Old County Road. SamTrans bus routes 260 and 262
operate along Ralston Avenue within the study area.

                                                                                                   Macrh 2014




Old County Road is a north-south two-lane roadway that runs parallel to US-101 and El Camino Real
from Bing Street to Laurie Meadows Drive, where it becomes Pacific Boulevard. On-street parking is
provided on both sides of the street in most locations. The posted speed limit is 30 mph. Old County
Road is designated as a Class III bicycle route, but does not have shared-lane ("sharrow") lane markings.

El Camino Real is a north-south four-lane arterial roadway that runs parallel to US-101 and provides
alternative regional access to the Project site. El Camino Real extends south from San Francisco and ends
near San Jose to the south. On-street parking is provided on both sides of the street in most locations
within the study area. The posted speed limit is 35 mph. SamTrans bus routes 397, ECR, and KX operate
along El Camino Real within the study area.

Harbor Boulevard is an east-west, four-lane roadway that extends west from US-101 and ends at El
Camino Real. On-street parking is provided on both sides of the street in most locations. The posted
speed limit is 35 mph. Harbor Boulevard provides direct access to US-101 and the Autobahn Motors
service center, located at 500 Harbor Boulevard.



EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES

PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals. In general, sidewalks are
provided on both sides of the study roadways. The exception is Island Parkway, which only has a sidewalk
along its western side. This is primarily due to the configuration of the US-101/Ralston Avenue
interchange. At signalized study intersections, pedestrian signals are provided where crosswalks are
striped. With the exception of intersections near the US-101/Ralston Avenue interchange, striped
crosswalks and pedestrian signals are provided on all approaches. The unsignalized intersection of Island
Parkway and the Project driveway has an unstriped pedestrian crossing on the west approach (Project
driveway) created by the sidewalk along Island Parkway and a striped crosswalk across Island Parkway to
the north of the intersection that provides access to the Bay Trail multiuse path.


BICYCLE FACILITIES

Bicycle facilities in the study area are shown in Figure 3, and include the following:

Bike paths (Class I) ­ Paved trails that are separated from roadways




                                                                                                            17
Transportation Impact Study for Belmont Autobahn Motors Expansion
March 2014




Bike lanes (Class II) ­ Lanes on roadways designated for use by bicycles through striping, pavement
legends, and signs

Bike routes (Class III) ­ Roadways designated for bicycle use by signs only; may or may not include
additional pavement width and/or shared-lane markings ("sharrows") for cyclists

There are several bicycle facilities near the Project site:

Island Parkway is designated as a Class II bicycle facility, with bicycle lanes beginning just north of the
Project site and terminating at Concourse Place, which also has Class II bike lanes.

Industrial Road is designated as a Class II bicycle facility that extends south from Harbor Boulevard to
Whipple Avenue near Redwood City.

Masonic Way is designated as a Class II bicycle facility, which extends west from Hiller Way to Old County
Road.

Old County Road is designated as a Class III bicycle route, though it does not provide shared-lane
markings on the roadway.

The Bay Trail passes to the east of the Project site and is a 330-mile network of Class I bicycle paths and
hiking trails around the Bay Area, with a planned network of over 500 miles of trails. There is also a Class I
bicycle path that begins north of the Project site near the Bay Trail, crosses US-101 via a dedicated bridge,
and travels alongside Ralston Avenue where it terminates at Hiller Street.

In addition, Ralston Avenue, Harbor Boulevard, and El Camino Real, while not officially designated routes,
are "cyclist suggested" routes (San Mateo County Bike Map, 2010), while El Camino Real is noted as a less
preferred route due to high traffic volumes.



EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE

Transit service in the study area is shown in Figure 3, which includes service provided by San Mateo
Transit District (SamTrans) and the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (Caltrain).


SAN MATEO COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT (SAMTRANS)

San Mateo Transit District (SamTrans) provides local transit (bus) service throughout San Mateo County
and regional service to San Francisco. The following SamTrans routes operate within the study area:

Francisco and Palo Alto primarily via US-101 and El Camino Real. Within the study area, Route KX operates
along El Camino Real. The closest stop to the Project site is located at the Belmont Caltrain Station ­ a 0.7
mile walk from the Project Site.


PENINSULA CORRIDOR JOINT POWERS BOARD (CALTRAIN)

Caltrain provides regional commuter rail service primarily between San Francisco to the north to San Jose
to the south via Local, Limited-stop, and Baby Bullet (i.e., express service) trains. Caltrain provides rail
service to Belmont via a station located immediately north of Ralston Avenue between El Camino Real and
Old County Road. Only Local and Limited-stop trains serve the Belmont station, with four to five Limited
Trains serving the station in each direction during the morning and afternoon peak periods. For access to
Baby Bullet rail service, Caltrain provides a free shuttle from the Belmont station to the Hillsdale station,
which is served by two to three Baby Bullet trains in each direction during the morning and afternoon
peak periods.

                                                                                                              19

EXISTING TRAFFIC COUNTS

Weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak period intersection turning
movement counts were conducted at the study intersections on Tuesday, December 10, 2013, including
counts of pedestrians and bicyclists. For the study intersections, the single hour with the highest traffic
volumes during the count periods was identified. Eastbound and westbound through movements on
Ralston Avenue represent the major AM and PM peak hour vehicle movements at most signalized study
intersections, with volumes gradually increasing towards the US-101/Ralston Avenue interchange.
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes are low in the study area. The counts generally indicated at most 10
pedestrian crossings per hour at study intersection crosswalks, with the exception of the intersections
adjacent to the Belmont Caltrain station, which saw around 20 to 30 pedestrians per hour. Bicycle volumes
were low, ranging from one to nine peak hour movements at most intersections. Peak hour vehicle
volumes are presented on Figure 1, along with existing lane configurations and traffic control devices (i.e.,
stop signs and traffic signals). The traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.

EXISTING ROADWAY OPERATIONS

INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE

Existing intersection operations were evaluated for the weekday AM and PM peak hours using the
methods described in Chapter 1; the results are summarized in Table 8. The analysis was based on the
volumes, lane configurations and traffic control shown on Figure 1. Observed peak hour factors 1 were
used at all intersections for the existing analysis.

As shown in Table 8, most of the signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better during the AM and
PM peak periods. The exception to this is the intersection of Ralston Avenue and El Camino Real, which
operates at LOS E during the PM peak period. The unsignalized intersection of the Project Driveway and
Island Parkway operates at LOS B or better during both the AM and PM peak periods, though the side-
street movements operate slightly worse due to delays for drivers waiting for gaps in the Island Parkway
traffic flow. Detailed intersection LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix B. Field
observations were used to calibrate and confirm the calculated levels of service.


SIGNAL WARRANTS

To assess the need for signalization of stop-controlled intersections, the California Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (California MUTCD) (Caltrans, 2006) presents eight signal warrants. The Peak Hour
Volume Warrant was used in this study as a supplemental analysis tool to assess operations at
unsignalized intersections. 2 Based on this analysis, the unsignalized study intersection at the Project
Driveway and Island Parkway does not meet the peak hour signal warrant for the Existing AM or PM peak
hours. Peak Hour signal warrant worksheets are included in Appendix C.




1
  The relationship between the peak 15-minute flow rate and the full hourly volume is the peak-hour factor (PHF) as defined in the
following equation: PHF=Hourly volume/(4 x volume during the peak 15 minutes of flow). The analysis of level of service is based on
peak rates of flow occurring within the peak 15 minutes of the peak hour because substantial short-term fluctuations typically occur
during an hour.
2
  Unsignalized intersection warrant analysis is intended to examine the general correlation between existing conditions and the need
to install new traffic signals. Existing peak-hour volumes are compared against a subset of the standard traffic signal warrants
recommended in the California MUTCD and associated State guidelines. This analysis should not serve as the only basis for deciding
whether and when to install a signal. To reach such a decision, the full set of warrants should be investigated based on field-
measured traffic data and a thorough study of traffic and roadway conditions by an experienced engineer. Furthermore, the decision
to install a signal should not be based solely on the warrants because the installation of signals can lead to certain types of collisions.
The responsible State or local agency should undertake regular monitoring of actual traffic conditions and accident data and
conduct a timely re-evaluation of the full set of warrants in order to prioritize and program intersections for signalization.

FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE

Existing weekday AM and PM peak hour operations of the freeway mainline segments on US 101 and
ramp merge and diverge areas were evaluated using the methods described in Chapter 1. As shown in
Table 9, all freeway segments operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak
periods. Therefore, the freeway segments are operating in compliance with the adopted LOS standard set
by the C/CAG Congestion Management Program (LOS E or better for study segments).

Detailed freeway segment LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix B.

3.       PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS

This chapter provides an overview of the proposed Project components and addresses the proposed
Project trip generation, distribution, and assignment characteristics, allowing for an evaluation of Project
impacts on the surrounding roadway network (discussed in the next chapter). The amount of traffic
associated with the Project was estimated using a three-step process:

     1) Trip Generation ­ The amount of vehicle traffic entering/exiting the Project site was estimated.
     2) Trip Distribution ­ The direction trips would use to approach and depart the site was projected.
     3) Trip Assignment ­ The specific roadways and intersection trips would use were determined.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The 3.6 acre Project site is currently developed with an Autobahn Motors sales and service center.
Autobahn Motors also operates out of two other sites in the vicinity - vehicle parking/storage on
approximately 2.2 acres across Island Parkway from the Project site, and an approximately 3.3 acre
service-only site on unincorporated San Mateo County land approximately one mile to the southeast at
500 Harbor Boulevard. The current Project proposes changes only to the site at 700 Island Parkway. The
Project location is shown on Figure 1.

The 500 Harbor Boulevard site is undergoing a separate re-configuration to allow for more vehicles
servicing during normal business hours and less reliance on multi-shift usage of bays. The service site
would be able to accommodate changes in servicing location resulting from the proposed Project as
detailed below.

Under both existing conditions and conditions with the proposed project, customers for both sales and
service go to the 700 Island Parkway site. Vehicles for service that are not serviced at the 700 Island
Parkway site are shuttled between the two sites by employees. (Customers do not access the service site
on Harbor Boulevard directly.) No changes in the general operations between the two sites are proposed;
although with a reduction in the service bays at the 700 Island Parkway site from 27 to 18, it is anticipated
proportionately fewer vehicles would be serviced there that would instead be shuttled to and serviced at
the Harbor Boulevard site.

The Project involves demolition of the existing 51,006-square foot Autobahn Motors facility at 700 Island
Parkway and construction of a 56,365-square foot structure serving the same general purpose. The stated
intent of the Project is to modernize the facilities and re-organize the space to better fit current usage

requirements. As a whole, the Project proposes an increase of 5,359 square feet for the facility at 700
Island Parkway, representing a 10.5 percent increase in total square footage. A summary of the proposed
changes to existing uses within the facility is shown in Table 10 below.

PROJECT TRIP GENERATION

Trip generation refers to the process of estimating the amount of vehicular traffic a project would add to
the surrounding roadway system. Estimates are created for the peak one-hour periods during the
morning and evening commute periods when traffic volumes on the adjacent streets are highest. Project
trip generation is typically estimated using rates that are published in the Institute of Transportation
Engineers Trip Generation (9th Edition), using common land uses that best match proposed project land
uses. However, this project's unique land use characteristics have no comparable published trip
generation rates. Therefore, Fehr & Peers conducted trip generation counts at the existing Autobahn
facility during the AM and PM peak periods of a typical weekday. This empirical data, along with
information provided by Autobahn Motors, was used to develop trip generation rates to forecast the net


                                                                                                           27

number of trips that the proposed Project would generate. Project trips were split to account for two
types of trips ­ trips associated with the overall building expansion and trips associated with the service
bay reduction and increased vehicle shuttling to the off-site service center. The trips associated with the
building expansion were based on the increase in overall square footage at the site (approximately 10.5
percent). The trips associated with the increased shuttle trips were based on the number of service bays
removed from the site (approximately 33.3 percent). The resulting trip generation forecasts are shown in
Table 11. The proposed Project is estimated to generate an additional 44 AM peak hour vehicle trips (27

PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

Trip distribution percentages were developed based on the location of the site, surrounding land uses
(schools, employment and retail destinations, etc.), known regional travel routes, current traffic turning
movements, and previous traffic studies in the area, as depicted on Figure 4. The Project trips were
assigned to the roadway system based on the directions of approach and departure, also shown in Figure
4. For all Project trips associated with the proposed square footage expansion, the directions of approach
and departure were based on existing Autobahn customer travel patterns. For the portion of Project trips
that are attributed to the decrease in service bays, the trip directions were based on the existing shuttle
route to the service center on Harbor Boulevard used by employees, which is also shown on Figure 4.

4.      EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

This chapter evaluates potential off-site traffic impacts under Existing Plus Project conditions.



EXISTING PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES

The Project traffic volumes were added to the existing peak hour traffic volumes (Figure 1) to estimate
the Existing Plus Project peak hour traffic volumes, as shown on Figure 5.



ANALYSIS OF EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE

Existing Plus Project conditions were evaluated using the same methods described in Chapter 1. The
Existing Plus Project intersection analysis results are presented in Table 12, based on the traffic volumes
presented on Figure 5. Table 12 also includes the operations results for the Existing conditions as a
comparison.

The intersections would continue to operate at the same levels of service with the addition of Project
traffic. Most signalized intersections would continue to operate at LOS D or better during both peak
hours. In addition, no signalized intersection would experience an increase in control delay beyond the
thresholds established in Table 5, resulting in a less-than-significant impact. The intersection of Ralston
Avenue and El Camino Real, which already operates at LOS E under Existing conditions, would experience
an increase in control delay of approximately two seconds and continue to operate at LOS E, resulting in a
less-than-significant impact.

The unsignalized intersection of the Project Driveway and Island Parkway would not experience an
increase in delay of more than five seconds and would continue to operate at better than LOS D during
both peak hours. Therefore, the project impact to this unsignalized intersection is considered less-than-
significant.

FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVEL OF SERVICE

Existing Plus Project freeway operations were evaluated using the methods described in Chapter 1. The
Existing Plus Project freeway segment analysis results are presented in Table 13, which also includes the
operations results for the Existing conditions for comparison.

With the addition of Project traffic, all freeway segments continue operate at an acceptable LOS D or
better during both the AM and PM peak periods. All segments continue to operate in compliance with the
adopted LOS standard set by the C/CAG Congestion Management Program (LOS E or better for study
segments), representing a less-than-significant impact to freeway segments near the Project site.

SIGNAL WARRANTS

A traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted at the unsignalized intersection of the Project Driveway
and Island Parkway under Existing plus Project conditions. Based on this analysis, the intersection does
not meet the peak hour signal warrant for the AM or PM peak hours. Peak Hour signal warrant worksheets
are included in Appendix C.

5.      CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

This chapter discusses Cumulative traffic conditions both without and with the Project. The future traffic
conditions analysis considers the build-out of the Project as well as other reasonably foreseeable new
development and planned roadway improvements in the surrounding areas.


CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC FORECASTS

The Cumulative scenario presented here represents year 2018 forecasts which include completion of other
approved and pending projects in the Project area and additional growth consistent with the C/CAG
regional travel demand models that were validated for traffic forecasting as part of the US 101/Holly
Street Interchange Project Approval and Environmental Document. The C/CAG models include the land
use changes (consistent with ABAG Projections 2011) and funded regional transportation projects. There
are no major roadway improvements planned in the vicinity of the Project; however, there is a significant
amount of land use growth projected in the area.

Year 2018 represents a reasonable Cumulative baseline scenario. It represents a timeline that would likely
see all pending/approved projects (including the proposed Project) to be completed and occupied. A
scenario reflecting conditions beyond the year 2018 may deemphasize Project trips and potential Project
impacts, because of significant growth around the project site.

The details of approved and pending projects in the Project area were provided by City of Belmont staff,
which included location, proposed land use type(s), and size. The trip distributions for these projects were
developed based on the characteristics of the projects and local knowledge of the area. Trip generation
and distribution details for pending projects are included in Appendix D.

The resulting Cumulative Without Project forecasts are presented on Figure 6. The Cumulative lane
geometries and traffic control devices are also shown. The peak hour Project volumes from Figure 4 were
added to the Cumulative Without Project traffic volumes to determine cumulative traffic volumes with the
proposed Project, as presented on Figure 7.

ANALYSIS OF CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS

INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE

The Cumulative Without and With Project conditions intersection analysis results are presented in Table
14. In the Cumulative Without Project condition, most study intersections are expected to operate at
acceptable service levels during both peak hours, with the exception of the signalized intersection of
Ralston Avenue and El Camino Real, which operates at LOS F and E during the AM and PM peak hours,
respectively.

With the addition of Project traffic, most signalized intersections would continue to operate at LOS D or
better during both peak hours. In addition, no intersection would experience an increase in control delay
beyond the thresholds established in Table 5 and Table 6, resulting in a less-than-significant impact.
While the intersection of Ralston Avenue and Island Parkway degrades from LOS D to LOS E during the
PM peak period with the addition of Project traffic due to an increase in control delay of three seconds,
this increase is below the City's established threshold of four seconds, resulting in a less-than-significant
impact.

The unsignalized intersection of the Project Driveway and Island Parkway would not experience an
increase in delay of more than five seconds and would continue to operate at better than LOS D during
both peak hours. Therefore, the project impact to unsignalized intersections is considered less-than-
significant.

All detailed intersection LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix B.

Although there are no significant impacts related to intersection LOS that are expected with the addition
of Project traffic, the City may consider revising intersection signal timings to improve operations and
better accommodate future levels of traffic.

Notes:
1. Signal = signalized intersection, SSS = side street stop controlled intersection.
2. Traffic operations results include delay (seconds per vehicle) and LOS (level of service). LOS is based on delay thresholds published
in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (Transportation Research Board, 2000). For side-street stop controlled intersections, average
delay is listed first followed by the delay for the worst approach in parentheses.
3. Bold denotes unacceptable level of service.

FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVEL OF SERVICE

The Cumulative Without and With Project conditions freeway segment analysis results are presented in
Table 15. In the Cumulative Without Project condition, all freeway segments operate at an acceptable
LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak periods.

With the addition of Project traffic, all freeway segments continue to operate at an acceptable LOS D or
better during both the AM and PM peak periods. All segments continue to operate in compliance with the
adopted LOS standard set by the C/CAG Congestion Management Program (LOS E or better for study
segments),representing a less-than-significant impact to freeway segments near the Project site.

Detailed freeway segment LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix B.

SIGNAL WARRANTS

A Cumulative Plus Project signal warrant analysis was conducted for the intersection of the Project
Driveway and Island Parkway using the method described in Chapter 2. Based on this analysis, the
unsignalized study intersection does not meet the peak hour signal warrant in either the morning or
evening peak hour. Signal warrant calculations are included in Appendix C.

6.      SITE PLAN REVIEW AND IMPACT SUMMARY

This chapter addresses site access and internal circulation for vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, and
emergency vehicles based on the site plan presented previously on Figure 2. It also reviews the parking
and sight distance requirements of the project site.



VEHICULAR SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

All vehicular access to the project site will be via the existing driveway off of Island Parkway. Island
Parkway ends just north of the project site in an area that is nearly fully developed. Therefore only modest
traffic volume increases will occur. , As a result the roadway would be adequate to handle all future year
forecasted volumes including the addition of Project traffic. Since the Project generates a relatively low
number of trips during the peak periods, and since off-peak trips to the site will be sporadic throughout
the rest of the day, one driveway would be sufficient to accommodate vehicular traffic. The Project
driveway as currently proposed is approximately 40 feet wide, which should be adequate to accommodate
typical project traffic maneuvers.



PEDESTRIAN ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

Pedestrian access to the project site would continue to be provided via a sidewalk along the western side
of Island Parkway from the US-101 Ramps to Concourse Drive, which passes adjacent to the project site.
This sidewalk provides access to pedestrian facilities along Ralston Avenue with adequate crossing
locations and pedestrian signals. The pedestrian facilities along Island Parkway are consistent with the
suburban nature of the area and the low volume of pedestrians, representing a less-than-significant
impact and no mitigation measures are required.



BICYCLE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

The proposed project would not substantially affect bicycle conditions in the area. Bicycle access to the
project site would continue to be provided by the Class II bicycle facility along Island Parkway, which

                                                                                                   Macrh 2014




provides connections to the Bay Trail, the multiuse pedestrian/bicycle bridge that crosses US-101 to the
west, and other bicycle routes near the City of Belmont. Therefore, the proposed project's impacts to
bicycle access and circulation will be less-than-significant.



TRANSIT ACCESS

The nearest transit stops are located near the intersection of Ralston Avenue and Hiller Street along San
Mateo Transit Routes 260 and 261, which is about 0.5 miles, or about a 10 minute walk, from the project
site. The stops are located immediately west of the intersection for both directions of travel. Although the
proposed project site is not immediately adjacent to transit facilities, a 10-minute walk is considered a
reasonable distance to transit. Further, the proposed project is not expected to generate substantial
amounts of new transit riders; therefore, the proposed project's impacts to transit are considered less-
than-significant.

Although the potential impact related to transit access is expected to be less-than-significant, Autobahn
Motors may consider offering a complimentary shuttle between the Project site and the Belmont Caltrain
Station as a customer amenity and to further encourage transit use in the area.



PARKING

The Belmont General Plan 1982 specifies that no new non-residential development shall be permitted
unless adequate off-street parking and loading spaces can be provided. Since there is no on-street
parking near the project site, all parking must be contained on-site for this project. The Project proposes
to provide 229 parking spaces, which includes spaces for employees and visitors, service bays, and vehicle
display. This amount of parking is equal to the number of parking spaces provided at the existing site.
Based on observations, the existing parking supply is adequate to accommodate the existing parking
demand. While the proposed project is expected to generate some additional trips to the project site, the
amount of parking provided would be sufficient to accommodate this additional demand and represents
a less-than-significant impact and no mitigation measures are required. The city may choose to monitor
parking at the site and implement additional parking requirements if on-site parking proves to be
problematic.

SIGHT DISTANCE REVIEW

Sight distance is a term generally used to define the distance of roadway visible to a driver. One of its
main applications is to inform whether a driver has adequate visibility to exit an intersection or driveway
and safely join the traffic stream in either direction. The project driveway must meet or exceed the
minimum required sight distance, as outlined in the applicable design manual.


METHODOLOGY

There are two widely accepted methodologies used to determine the minimum required sight distance:

     ·     A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (the American Association of State Highway
           and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), 2004)

     ·     Highway Design Manual (Caltrans)

Both methods take into account similar roadway design characteristics, however, AASHTO tends to
produce slightly more conservative results. In order to represent a more conservative analysis, we use the
AASHTO method for all calculations in this report.

Minimum stopping sight distances should be provided at intersections or driveways, and is defined as
follows:

           Stopping sight distance ­ Distance required by the driver of a vehicle, traveling at a given
           speed, to bring the vehicle to a stop after an object on the road becomes visible in advance
           of reaching the object.

Stopping sight distance is measured along the length of the roadway from the location of the vehicle on
the cross street or driveway. A clear line of sight should be maintained from the driver on the cross street
or driveway to the vehicle on the major street, located at a distance equal to the stopping sight distance.
Minimum recommended stopping sight distances are presented in Table 16.

PROJECT DRIVEWAY OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS

The Project driveway is located at the terminus of a slight vertical curve on Island Parkway, with the
southbound approach on Island Parkway relatively flat, while the northbound approach has a slight
downward grade. The posted speed limit on Island Parkway is 30 miles per hour.

The observed sight distance for the existing southbound approach to the Project driveway is
approximately 550 feet, while the observed sight distance for the existing northbound approach is
approximately 300 feet. Since the northbound approach to the driveway has a slight downward grade, a
three percent downgrade was assumed. The Project does not include any modifications to the existing
driveway access, therefore our existing site observations are also used to represent Project conditions.


Based on a design speed of 30 miles per hour and assuming a level grade for the southbound approach
and a three percent downgrade for the northbound approach, the minimum recommended stopping
sight distance for drivers traveling along Island Parkway is 200 feet in the southbound direction and 205
feet in the northbound direction (see Table 16). These results indicate that the observed sight distances
for drivers traveling in both directions along Island Parkway exceed the minimum recommended stopping
sight distances based on AASHTO guidelines, representing a less-than-significant impact and no
mitigation measures are required.

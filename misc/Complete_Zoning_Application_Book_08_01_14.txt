August 1, 2014

1. Introduction

This narrative is submitted in support of the submission made to the Covington Planning and
Zoning Commission under the Covington City Zoning regulations (The regulations) for the new
additions to Saint Scholasitca Academy as follows:

   •   Area 1: New Gymnasium, multi-purpose, classroom and support facilities in the block
       bounded by South Jancke Ave, East 21st Avenue, East 20th Avenue and South Massachusetts
       Street.

       General Description of the Work: Demolition of the existing Wisdom Hall and
       Gymnasium and construction of a new gymnasium, multi-purpose facility, classroom
       building and support facilities. The new facilities will include a new gymnasium with seating
       capacity for 1000 (A Louisiana High School Athletic Association requirement) with dressing
       rooms, weight training facilities and support space, a new multi-purpose facility with seating
       for 720 in chairs with stage and support space, four (4) classrooms and five (5) training labs.
       Refer to Sheets mark PZ2.1 & PZ2.2 for floor plans showing the proposed structure.

       In addition to the building construction noted above, there are proposed site improvements
       both on and off site that include the following:

           o     Handicapped parking spaces on the South east side of the site
           o     Reorganized on-street parking on the North side of the site
           o     Reorganized on-street parking on both sides of East 21st Street
           o     A service drive on the South west side of the site
           o     Raised plaza and walk at the main entry to avoid affecting tree root systems
           o     A redeveloped interior parking lot at the corner of Jahncke & 21st Ave.
           o     Improved & reorganized parallel parking along East Rutland


   •   Area 2: New surface parking lot located in the existing lot presently containing an apartment
       complex owned by the Arch Diocese of New Orleans.

       General Description of the Work: Demolition of the existing apartment complex and
       construction of a new surface parking lot containing 32 new parking spaces. The new
       parking lot will be paved using concrete curbs and gutter with limestone aggregate surface.


2|Narrative: Additions to St. Scholastica
        The purpose of the limestone surface is to allow percolation of rainwater and to slow down
        the runoff of precipitation.

2. Zoning Classification

A review of the zoning map indicates that the property associated with Area 1 is zoned ID-
Institutional (Section 3.19) and Area 2 is zoned CDB- Community Business (Section 3.17).
Reference is made to the current City of Covington published Zoning Map. In both cases the uses
proposed meet the requirement of their respective sections.

3. HDC Overlay District

Both of the areas noted above are located within the City of Covington HDC Overlay District. A
review of the requirements of this overlay district indicate that the overlay district requirements and
guidelines are less stringent than that of the ID (Institutional District) Zoning classification
requirements. Therefore, this application follows the guide as outlined by the ID Zoning
classification are the guide in meeting the requirements for this project.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the New Construction Project was submitted to the Covington
Historic District Commission on April 8, 2014 and was unanimously approved. The April 8th
approval contained the demolition of Wisdom Hall and the Existing Gymnasium as well as the
design for the all of the proposed new construction located on square 33 of Area 1 of this
application. The color renderings from that presentation are included herein for reference.

Additionally, a second appearance, on May 13, 2014, was made before the Covington Historic
Commission for the approval to demolish the existing Bogue Falaya Apartments located on square 3
to make way for the proposed new surface parking lot in Area 2 of this application. Again the
CHDC application was unanimously approved.

Copies of both Certificates of Appropriateness from the Covington Historic District Commission
are attached herein for reference.

4. Zoning Data for ID Zoning District

Reference is made to Sheet PZ1.0 – Covington Zoning Data Table. The following covers the issues
addressed within this table:

Set Back Requirements within the ID District

The ID Zoning designation defines set back requirements within Section 3.19 of the regulations.
Since the site covers an entire block, a determination was required as to the defined front / side / rear


3|Narrative: Additions to St. Scholastica
yard locations. The regulations state that “on corner lots, the front yard shall be considered as parallel to
the street on which the lot has the least dimension” (reference is made to page 20 or 21 yard, front
definition). Since this is a whole block and the lot length is least along East 21st and East 20th Street,
the front yard was defined as the side facing east 21st Street. Section 3.1905 outlines the
requirements for setbacks as follows:

    •   Front yard -     Ten (10) Feet
    •   Side yard-       Fifteen (15) Feet (Corner lot requirement)
    •   Rear yard-       Ten (10) Feet

Reference is made to the attached drawing sheet mark PZ1.0, where the set back lines are indicated.
The building lines fall within the setback lines required above. The following yard setbacks have
been achieved on this proposed plan:

    •   Front yard :     Fifteen (15) Feet – Along East 21 St.
    •   Side yard 1:     Fifteen (15) Feet- Along South. Massachusetts St.
    •   Side yard 2:     Twenty-One (21) Feet along South Jahncke St.
    •   Rear yard:       Twenty (20) Feet- Along East 20th Ave.



5. Lot Coverage Limitations within the ID District

 The site is located within the ID District limits the maximum lot coverage to 60% of the total area
of the lot. The requirement notes “maximum lot coverage: The lot coverage of all principal and accessory
buildings on a zoning lot shall not exceed 60% of the total area of the lot.” The lot in question is defined
as Square 33 which contains a total area of 60,000 square feet. The total footprint of the ground
floor equals to 30,700 square feet or 51% of the lot area. The lot area coverage is therefore achieved.

6. Maximum Height

Section 3.1907 of the regulations states “Height requirements- No building or structure shall exceed 35
feet above the finished grade of the property….”. The building elevations (refer to sheets PZ3.1 &
PZ3.2) indicate the following heights;

    •   Height to ridge of parapet walls:         35 feet
    •   Height to peak of gymnasium:              35 feet
    •   Height to roof edge:                      29 feet




4|Narrative: Additions to St. Scholastica
The vast majority of the roof is the 29 foot height which is well within the 35 foot maximum height
limitation, therefore this requirement is achieved.



7. Traffic Impact Study

Section 3.1913 of the regulations requires that a traffic impact study be done if the development
exceeds the criteria outlines in section 4.6 of the regulations. Section 4.603(b) of the regulations
states that if an institutional use is proposed that exceeds 40,000 square feet, a traffic impact study is
required. The proposed addition to the site is a net add of 32,463 square feet and once demolition
takes place a total of 48,529 new square feet will exist on the site. SSA commissioned Tom Swanson,
PE, PTOE, a qualified transportation planner licensed by LAPELS to undertake a traffic study. The
study found no impact from this proposed project. Reference is made to the attached Traffic Impact
Study conducted by GEC Engineers, 06/26/2014 .



8. Landscape Ordinance: Tree Planting Areas

Area 1

Section 4.208 requires street plantings for all new construction in ID Institutional zoned areas.
Street planting areas are designated on the attached drawings marked PZ1.1 & PZ1.2. 4.208.1c
states “When a corner property faces onto any two public streets, a ten-foot wide street planting area will
be required on the side street in addition to the front 15-foot street planting requirement”. In accordance
with this requirement the following conditions are achieved:

    •    Front Yard, East 21st Ave.                       15 feet Street Planting Area (Continuous)
    •    Corner Side Yard, Massachusetts St.              10 feet Street Planting Area (Continuous)
    •    Corner Side yard, Jahncke Ave.                   10 feet Street Planting Area (Continuous)
    •    Rear Yard, East 20th Ave.                        15 feet Street Planting Area (Continuous)

Within the described Street Planting Areas listed above section 4.208. 6a requires that “a min. of one
Class A tree for every 20 linear feet of building site frontage”. Furthermore, the same section indicates
that “Credit will be given on a one-to-one basis for existing trees preserved and protected in the street
planting area” In accordance with this requirement, the following conditions will be met.

    •    East 21st Ave. = 240 feet of frontage,                           requires 12 Class A trees
                                          2 existing trees within planting area will be preserved
                 Therefore,                                        10 Class A Trees are required

5|Narrative: Additions to St. Scholastica
   •   Massachusetts St. = 250 feet of frontage                       requires 13 Class A trees
                                      1 existing tree within planting area will be preserved
             Therefore,                                       12 Class A Trees are required


   •   Jahncke Ave. = 250 feet of frontage                     requires 13 Class A trees
                                      2 existing trees within planting area will be preserved
              Therefore,                                       11 Class A Trees are required


   •   East 20th Ave. = 240 feet of frontage                   requires 12 Class A trees
                                       1 existing tree within planting area will be preserved
               Therefore,                                      11 Class A Trees are required


Within Area 1, at the corner of Jahncke and 20th Ave., a newly resurfaced and improved interior
surface parking lot is planned. This new parking lot is approximately 3,968 square feet. . Section
4.209.1a requires “landscaping for parking lots with more than seven parking spaces or that are larger
than 3000 square feet”. And Section 4.209.1b requires that “Planting areas shall be a minimum of ten
percent of the paved parking area”. The attached drawing mark PZ1.1 illustrates the following:

   •   3,968 square feet x 10%=        Required Planting Area of 396 square feet.
   •   Planting Area Shown=            396 square feet

Planting Requirements: Section 4.209.2e requires “a minimum of one Class B tree be planted for every
seven parking spaces” The attached drawing mark PZ1.2 illustrates the following:

   •   11 parking spaces:      Requires two (2) Class B Trees



Within Area 1, at the corner of Jahncke and 21st Ave., a newly resurfaced and improved interior
surface parking lot is planned. This new parking lot is approximately 4,259 square feet. . Section
4.209.1a requires “landscaping for parking lots with more than seven parking spaces or that are larger
than 3000 square feet”. And Section 4.209.1b requires that “Planting areas shall be a minimum of ten
percent of the paved parking area”. The attached drawing mark PZ1.1 illustrates the following:

   •   4,259 square feet x 10%=        Required Planting Area of 425 square feet.
   •   Planting Area Shown=            634 square feet

Planting Requirements: Section 4.209.2e requires “a minimum of one Class B tree be planted for every
seven parking spaces” The attached drawing mark PZ1.2 illustrates the following:

    •    12 parking spaces:     Requires two (2) Class B Trees



Area 2

The new surface parking lot within Area 2 is approximately 11,524 square feet. Section 4.209.1a
requires “landscaping for parking lots with more than seven parking spaces or that are larger than 3000
square feet”. And Section 4.209.1b requires that “Planting areas shall be a minimum of ten percent of
the paved parking area”. The attached drawing mark PZ1.2 illustrates the following:

    •    11,524 square feet x 10%=      Required Planting Area of 1,152 square feet.
    •    Planting Area Shown for Area 2=        3,325 square feet

Planting Requirements: Section 4.209.2e requires “a minimum of one Class B tree be planted for every
seven parking spaces” The attached drawing mark PZ1.2 illustrates the following:

    •    32 parking spaces:     Requires five (5) Class B Trees



9. Preservation of Existing Live Oak Trees

Approval of a Tree Removal Application is pending.

SSA has already requested a permit for the removal of (2) two Live Oak Trees located on block 33.
One tree measures 52”dbh and the other measures 48“dbh. A tree inventory and condition report
has been prepared by Bayou Tree Service, who is a licensed arborist specializing in the care and
preparation of Live Oak Trees for nearby construction. In the report, the two trees identified as
SSA-3 (52”dbh) & SSA-5 (48“dbh), are deemed in poor health and have structural issues that could
pose a safety hazard. The design team has made significant efforts to limit the impacts of
construction to as few trees as possible. There are (10) ten Live Oak Trees on site. Only the two
identified as SSA-3 & SSA-5 will be removed. The remaining trees will be prepared and monitored
by the owner’s licensed Arborist, per the attached report, to strengthen the health of the trees and
prepare them for construction. It should be noted that this team (Bayou Tree Service and Holly &
Smith Architects) have successfully executed a similar scope of work on the United States Federal
Courthouse in Baton Rouge and at the West Feliciana Parish Courthouse in St. Francisville. Both
of these projects were very similar in scope and complexity to what exists at SSA. The Federal

7|Narrative: Additions to St. Scholastica
Courthouse in Baton Rouge was completed in 1993 and the West Feliciana Courthouse was
completed in 2005. All of the trees which were preserved and prepared for construction are alive
and thriving.

10. Parking Requirements

The construction program consist of an approach to the phased construction that will allow use of
the existing gym while the multi-purpose space is being constructed and then the use of the multi-
purpose for daily physical education while the new gym is under construction. The construction
process will create congestion and as a result it is proposed that a pre-step be made to remove the
apartments on East Rutland in order to provide additional parking (32 spaces) for use during the
construction process.

 A review of the parking regulations (refer to section 4.1 table 41.1) relative to this use indicates the
following requirements:

    •   High School:                     10 parking spaces / classroom
    •   Training Labs:                   10 spaces / training lab
    •   Junior High School:              4 spaces / classroom
    •   Indoor Recreational:             1 Space / 10 seats
    •   Public Assembly/Theaters:        1 space / 6 seats

In order to establish parking requirements the entire campus will have to be considered since parking
requirements are calculated by instructional space for the entire campus. As a result of making this
count, the following exists:

NORMAL EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES

Classrooms

    •   Existing Classrooms on campus not affected by Construction:                       36 Classrooms
    •   New Classrooms that replace Wisdom Hall:                                           4 Classrooms


        Total Classrooms after Completion of Construction:                                40 Classroom

Of the classrooms outlined above the following applies to SSA:

    •   High School Classrooms (10th,11th, & 12th grades):          25 Classrooms
    •                               th     th
        Junior High Classrooms (8 & 9 grades):                      15 Classrooms



8|Narrative: Additions to St. Scholastica
As a result of the above determination, the following parking spaces are required for the educational
use:

   •   High School Classrooms:         25 Classrooms @ 10 space / classroom=           250 Spaces
   •   Junior High Classrooms:         15 Classrooms @ 4 spaces per classroom=          60 Spaces


       Total Spaces required for Classrooms:                                           310 Spaces




MULTI-PURPOSE, GYMNASIUM & TRAINING LAB FACILITIES

Multi-Purpose Building

The attached drawing mark PZ2.1 shows a seating capacity of the new multi-purpose building of
720 seats. The requirement for multi-purpose is listed on page 2 of 37 in Table 41.1 under “Public
Assembly / Arenas / Theaters” as 1 space per 6 seats. Therefore the following parking requirement
applies:

   •   Multi-Purpose Space: 720 seats @ 1 space per 6 seats =                         120 Spaces

Gymnasium Building

The attached drawing marks PZ2.1 & PZ2.2 show a seating capacity of 1000 seats in the new
gymnasium. This is based on the count of retractable bleacher seating. The requirement for
gymnasium is listed on page 2 of 37 in Table 41.1 under “Indoor Recreation” as 1 space per 10 seats.
Therefore the following parking requirement applies:

   •   Indoor Recreation Space: 1000 seats @ 1 space per 10 seats=                    100 Spaces

Training Labs

The attached drawing marks PZ2.1 & PZ2.2 show a total of Five (5) Training Labs. These spaces
are not classrooms. They are intended as multi-purpose spaces to be used for after school
extracurricular functions as well as STEM Labs (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics).
The presence of theses labs do not add to the total student population. They will be used non-
concurrently to the normal academic classrooms. The requirement for training labs is listed on page
2 of 37 in Table 41.1 under “High Schools and Vocational Schools” as 10 spaces per training lab.
Therefore the following parking requirement applies:


9|Narrative: Additions to St. Scholastica
    •   Training Labs: 5 Labs @ 10 space / Lab =                                               50 Spaces


        Total Spaces required for Multi-Purpose, Gymnasium & Training Lab = 270 Spaces



Parking Count at the end of this Construction Program

As a result of completion of this construction program, the total parking count will be as follows:

    •   Off-street parking (SSA property):                                                   145 Spaces
    •   On-street parking:                          147 spaces – 4 for On-Street Credits = 143 Spaces
    •   Shared Parking (with St. Peters Catholic School):                                      57 Spaces
        Total Parking                                                                        345 Spaces

The above represents an increase of 46 spaces from the existing parking count of 299 spaces

Reduction of Parking Requirements allowed by Regulations

Section 4.103 of the regulations addresses combination of uses whereby it states “Off Street parking
for separate uses may be provided collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the
sum of the spaces required for each separately.”

Spaces Provided =                   345 Spaces
Therefore per section 4.103:        345 is greater than 310 (Classroom requirement) and,
                                    345 is greater than 270 (Gym & M.P. requirement).

Section 4.103 goes on to say in subparagraph 1 that “Joint use of 50 percent of required parking spaces
may be permitted for two or more uses, provided that the use of such facility by each user does not occur at
the same time.”

SSA meets this definition in that the use of the gym and multi-purpose is primarily an after school
use and when the gym or multi-purpose is in use during the school day it is being used by the
students of the school. As a result the following applies:

Classroom Requirement: 310 spaces x 50% =                                                    155 Spaces

Gymnasium & Multi-Purpose Requirement: 270 spaces x 50% =                                    135 Spaces

Total Combined Use requirement:                                                              290 Spaces

Reference to On-Street Parking

As mentioned previously, a traffic impact study has been conducted and is included herein with this
application. Within the study, it has been determined that none of the roads immediately
surrounding the SSA campus which contain on-street parking meet the LADOTD minimum design
guidelines for functional classification as an arterial or collector, so all would be considered local
roads. Therefore, section 4.105.2e stating that “parking spaces located on arterial and/or collector
streets may not be used for credited on-street parking…” does not apply. On-street parking is
considered in the overall parking counts.

Furthermore, SSA understands that exclusivity is not allowed. Per section 4.105.2f, “On street
parking spaces credited for a specific use shall not be used exclusively by that use, but shall be available for
general public use at all times.” SSA will not engage in any actions or signage that would limit general
public use of these on-street spaces.

Clearance from Fire Hydrants
Per the advisement of Al Courouleau, the City of Covington Building Inspector, no parking will
occur within 10’ of a fire hydrant. Existing fire hydrants locations are shown on drawing mark
PZ1.0.

Parking Conclusion
The primary goal of this new expansion project is to provide essential facilities necessary for the
continued success of St. Scholastica Academy. In conjunction with that, it is the desire of SSA to
improve the parking and traffic situation both immediately on and around the SSA campus. This
project will relieve parking congestion in the immediate area of the site which will benefit the
community and make conditions around the campus safer. There is a plan to develop a more orderly
and logical traffic pickup and drop off sequence that will create a safer condition on public streets
and relieve some of the congestion on Jahncke Ave. This plan will need to be reviewed and
coordinated with the Covington Police Department before moving forward. Furthermore,
developing the new gymnasium as well as new parking configurations will create an opportunity to
improve site lines at the corners. This is especially so at the corner of 21st and Massachusetts, where
the footprint of the new gymnasium will be moved within the current required setbacks, thus
backing it away from the corner property line.

12. Water and Sewer Service Connections

The water and sewer connections to the proposed structures will be made to the existing lines that
are located in the street rights-of-way surrounding Square 33. We anticipate reusing the existing
sewer connections that presently handle the waste from the Gymnasium and the Wisdom Hall.

For the water service, the existing connections will be evaluated to determine whether they are
adequate for the proposed improvements. This determination will be made in the design phase of
the project when the actual demands for the buildings will be established. As part of this project, a
new 6” fire connection will be made to the City’s water distribution system. The location for this
connection will be determined during the design phase.

13. Signage

Signage is not planned as part of this project at this time. If it does become evident that owner
requires and/or desires signage at a later date, Part 6, Covington Sign Regulations will be followed
and the signage will be submitted to both Planning & Zoning as well as the Covington Historic
District Commission for approval.

14. Exterior Site Lighting

Exterior lighting is to be Pulse Start Metal Halide and LED type. Control of exterior lighting will be
through time clock and photocell. Exterior lighting will be served at 277 volt, single phase where
possible to minimize voltage drop. All exterior lighting shall be full cut-off, dark sky compliant.
Light spillage past the property line will be limited to less than 2 foot candles.

Lighting types for each space type will be the following types:
Parking Lot & Pedestrian Way – 15’ Pole with a single 150w Metal Halide Lamp
Sidewalks – Wall Mounted LED wall packs

Lighting in each space will generally provide the following illumination level:
Parking Lot & Pedestrian Way – 2 foot candle average
Sidewalks – 1 foot candle average

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
OVERVIEW
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the traffic impacts associated with the renovation of
the St. Scholastica Academy, an all-girls high school located at the southwest corner of the
intersection of Boston Street and South Massachusetts Street in Covington, LA. The scope
of this study includes the physical description of the existing location, traffic data such as
current turning movement counts, and technical analyses to evaluate existing traffic volumes.
It includes trip generation estimates and future traffic operations. It should be noted that
school was in session at the time of the data collection, but the seniors had already been
dismissed for the school year, so and estimate of their numbers will be added traffic
volumes.

The school is located in a fully developed area in the city of Covington. The heaviest traffic
around the proposed redevelopment is along S. Jahnke Ave, which borders the southeast
edge of the property being developed.

The improvement of this facility is not expected to have significant impact on traffic
volumes. After a review of the volumes at the area around the school facility, it is anticipated
that the studied intersections are expected to operate within the acceptable Level of Service
thresholds.

RECOMMENDATIONS

There are numerous sidewalks in the neighborhood surrounding the school. To improve
pedestrian safety and traffic flow in the vicinity of the school improvements, the following
improvements should be considered:

Painted crosswalks connecting sidewalks on the following intersections:
 S. Massachusetts and E. Rutland St. at E. 21st St.
 E. Rutland St. at N. Vermont St.
 E. 21st St. at S. Jahncke Ave.
 S. Massachusetts at 20th
 E. 20th St. at S. Jahncke Ave.

I. INTRODUCTION

Purpose of Study

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the traffic impacts associated with the renovation of
the St. Scholastica Academy, which includes the gymnasium and multi-purpose facility,
additional classroom space and gym support facilities, located in the southwest corner of the
intersection of E. 21st Avenue and South Massachusetts Street in Covington, LA. (See Figure
1).

The objectives of this study are:
    To adequately assess the traffic impacts associated with the addition of the proposed
       school building, and to identify traffic control improvements required to service the
       studied area;
    To provide public agencies a comprehensive study which evaluates and documents
       the traffic impacts and recommended improvements, where warranted;
    To provide a technically sound basis to identify impacts and related mitigation
       requirements in response to surrounding traffic impacts.

This study includes an evaluation of the traffic operations at the studied intersections using a
comparison of the Synchro analysis output reports for the post-construction scenario with
existing volumes (year 2014), and the Year 2017 scenario demonstrates that the existing
roadway network is capable of accommodating the development and natural growth of the
area.

II. STUDY AREA
The studied area roadway system identified for investigation includes five intersections in the
immediate vicinity of the proposed new school building. Figure 1 is a map of the study area
and illustrates the five intersections studied in this analysis. None of the roads listed below
meet the LADOTD minimum design guidelines for a functional classification as a collector,
so all would be considered local roads
.


Existing Roadway Network

S. Jahnke Street operates as a two-way, two-lane roadway with some restricted parking on
the east side of the street.

S. Massachusetts Street operates as a one-way, single-lane roadway between E. 20th Avenue
and E. 21st Avenue, with some roadside parking. It continues as a two lane two way roadway
from N. Massachusetts Street from 21st Avenue (including roadside parking) and southward
from 20th Avenue. It runs generally north to south.

E. Rutland Street operates as a two-way, two-lane roadway with roadside parking not
permitted between E. 20th Avenue and E. 21st Avenue, it runs parallel to S. Massachusetts
Street up to E. 21st Avenue.

E. 21st Avenue operates as a one-way, single-lane roadway with roadside parking Between S.
Jahnke and S. Masachusetts Street. It operates as two way two lane roadway as it continues
generally east. Some roadside parking is permitted.

E. 20th Avenue operates as a two-way, two-lane roadway on the southern edge of the school
complex. There is roadside parking along the north side of the street.

N. Vermont Street operates as a two-way, two-lane roadway north of the school site from
the intersection of E. Rutland Street and S. Jahnke Street.

Listed below are the study intersections.

       S. Massachusetts and E. Rutland St. at E. 21st St.
       E. Rutland St. at N. Vermont St.
       E. 21st St. at S. Jahncke Ave.
       S. Massachusetts at 20th
       E. 20th St. at S. Jahncke Ave.

A brief description of each study intersection is listed below.

       S. Massachusetts and E. Rutland St. at E. 21st St. - A four-legged intersection
        with stop controls on Massachusetts St. The existing campus is located on the
        southwest corner of this intersection. The facility expansion is in the southeast corner
        of this intersection.

       E. Rutland St. at N. Vermont St. - A four-legged intersection with stop controls on
        all four approaches.

       E. 21st St. at S. Jahncke Ave. - A four-legged intersection with stop controls on the
        21st St. approaches.

       S. Massachusetts at 20th St. – A four-legged intersection with stop controls on the
        S. Massachusetts approaches. The existing campus is located on the northwest corner
        of this intersection. The facility expansion is in the northeast corner of this
        intersection.

       E. 20th St. at S. Jahncke Ave.- A four-legged intersection with stop controls on the
        20th St. approaches.


Discussion

No crosswalk paint is visible at most of the surrounding intersections.

For the most part roadside parking is gravel shoulders.

III. DEVELOPMENT
Description

The new facilities will include a gymnasium and multi-purpose facility, replacing the existing
gymnasium in the same location, including gym support facilities and additional classroom
space. Some current gravel parking will be replaced by marked paved parking along the
roadside.

In addition, a new 44 space parking lot will be constructed on the north side of E. Rutland St.
between 21st Avenue and S. Jahnke Street with access to N. Massachusetts Street and E.
Rutland Street.

The gym and multi-purpose facility will serve purposes outside its functions as part of the
school. There will be a potential for up to 1800 occupants. These functions, however, will not
be part of the daily routine and are not expected to contribute any trips during the hours of
peak traffic volumes.

IV. TRIP GENERATION
Site Traffic Generation

Site traffic generation determines the additional traffic attributable to the development, more
specifically, the vehicle trips entering and exiting the site. Trip generation can be defined as an
estimate of the number of trips generated by specific building or land uses. These trips
represent the volume of new traffic added to the roadways due to the proposed development
as well as traffic diverted from the existing traffic stream and other on-site land uses. The
volume of traffic generated by a site is dependent on the intended land use and size of the
development. Trip Generation,v.8 by Trafficware, a software package based on Trip
Generation, 9th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), was
used as a reference for this information.

The school serves approximately 640 students. We used the equivalent of a ‘High School’
land-use (ITE Land Use Code: 530).

Traffic volumes were collected while school was in session; however, the senior class had
already been dismissed for the school year. The school issues 180 student parking passes for
the school year. For purposes of this study, it is assumed that seniors account for most of the
parking passes. 70% (126) of the 180 will be added to the surrounding roadway network to
account for seniors. To be conservative, the entire 126 vehicles will be distributed to the
network for the am peak for arrivals, and 126 vehicles will be added to the PM peak for
departures.

After the reconstruction, the school is expected to serve a maximum of 700 students. Table 1
shows the trip generation summary for the ITE Code 530 ‘High School’ land-use. All trip
generation rates/calculations for the High School land-use are included in the Appendix A of
this report.

The increase in trip generation estimates during the peak hours is 26 in the AM peak and 8 in
the PM peak period. This is an insignificant amount. Additionally, the potential increase in
student body is not connected to the renovation, thus was not considered to be a result of the
proposed construction.

V. SITE TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION
Site Traffic Distribution

The cumulative effect of site traffic on the transportation network is dependent on the origins
and destinations of that traffic and the location of the access drives serving the site. The
proposed arrival/departure distribution of traffic to be generated at this site is considered a
function of several parameters, including the following:

                             Travel patterns at the existing site
                             Existing traffic conditions and controls
                             Proposed site access drive locations
                             Population centers in the area
                             Existing highway network

The methodology for the site traffic distribution is based on existing traffic counts and the
location of trip generators and trip attractions in the vicinity of the proposed site.

The traffic volumes in this roadway network are fairly low, and the difference trip generation
values for this development would add an insignificant amount of traffic to the surrounding
roadway, so for purposes of this study, they will not be considered.


Figure 3 depicts the overall percentage of traffic approaching and departing on the major
approaches around the new development.

Figure 4 depicts the projected additional volumes due to the seniors. As previously
described, 126 vehicles will be arriving in the AM peak, and 126 vehicles leaving in the PM
peak. These additional vehicles will be propagated along the network in proportion to the
existing movement volumes.

VI. INTERSECTION ANALYSES
Analysis Methodology
The capacity of a highway system is predicated by two components: the capacity of the
included roadway sections and the capacity of the affected intersections along the route.
Intersecting roadways generally provide the initial constraint on a system's capacity.
Efficiency at the intersections becomes the critical constraint for capacity. Vehicle
interactions at these points must therefore be analyzed to assess the projected operation and
capacity levels.

The standard procedure for capacity analysis of signalized and unsignalized intersections is
outlined in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research
Board. Synchro 8 Software was used in analyzing operating conditions at study area
intersections. The procedure yields a Level of Service (LOS) as an indicator of how well
intersections operate.

The concept of LOS is defined as a qualitative measurement describing operating conditions
within a traffic stream and their perception by motorists and/or passengers. LOS is defined
in terms of delay which is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and
lost travel time.

Six Levels of Service, with corresponding levels of delay are defined for analysis. They are
assigned letter designations, from “A” to “F”, with LOS “A” representing the best conditions
(little or no delay), LOS “C” average conditions and LOS “F” the worst (excessive delay). The
projected traffic volumes, generated by the site and added to the background traffic volumes,
are analyzed to assess the capacity potential of the study area intersections.

Table II depicts LOS criteria for Two-Way-Stop-Control (TWSC) and All-Way-Stop-Control
(AWSC) Intersections and Table III depicts LOS criteria for signalized intersections.

VII. BASELINE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
Existing Traffic Volume Data

Given the functional characteristics of the study area and the land use for the site, the peak
hours selected for analysis were weekday AM and PM peak periods. The combination of site
traffic and adjacent thru traffic produces the greatest demand during these time periods.

Weekday AM and PM peak traffic counts were obtained by GEC, Inc., at the study area
intersections previously identified. Data collection occurred between 6:00 to 9:00 AM and
3:00 to 7:00 PM. These time frames were selected because they represent the greatest
combination of traffic on the adjacent highways for the type of land use proposed for the site.
All turning movement count data was collected on Tuesday May 20, 2014. The turning
movement count data is included in Appendix C.

As previously described, the additional projected trips generated by the difference in student
body was not considered, and estimated seniors were added to the existing Year 2014 peak
hour volumes to obtain the baseline pre-development peak hour volumes.

The peak hour operations at the study intersections were analyzed using Synchro 8 software
with the existing roadway geometry and existing Year 2014 traffic volumes, with trip volumes
estimated by the seniors added. A diagram illustrating the counted intersection volumes with
additional senior projected traffic is shown in Figure 5. Capacity analysis results of the
Existing Year 2014 conditions are contained in Table IV.

IX. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS (YEAR
2017)
Post Development Volumes
The Year 2017 build-out year post-development volumes were obtained by projecting
network traffic volumes out to determine Year 2017 traffic volumes.

This is a well-developed residential area; overall traffic growth is expected to be low. A
projection of traffic volume for 3 years in the future was created assuming a growth rate of
1.5%.

The future weekday peak hour operations at the study intersection were analyzed using
Synchro 8 software with the existing roadway geometry to determine Year 2017 projected site
traffic volumes.

A diagram illustrating the projected intersection volumes post-development is shown in
Figure 6. Capacity calculation results for baseline conditions and post development
conditions are shown in Table VI.

It should be noted, that the intersection of S. Massachusetts/E. Rutland Ave. AT
E. 21st Ave. /S. Massachussets St. is not an allowed configuration for HCM analysis, but the
intersection operates well in simulation.

X. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
   The school is located in a fully developed area in the city of Covington. The heaviest traffic
   around the proposed redevelopment is along S. Jahnke Ave, which borders the southeast
   edge of the property being developed.

   The improvement of this facility is not expected to have significant impact on traffic volumes.
   After a review of the volumes at the area around the school facility, it is anticipated that the
   studied intersections are expected to operate within the acceptable Level of Service
   thresholds.

   Recommendations

   There are numerous sidewalks in the neighborhood surrounding the school. To improve
   pedestrian safety and traffic flow in the vicinity of the school improvements, the following
   improvements should be considered:

   Painted crosswalks connecting sidewalks on the following intersections:
    S. Massachusetts and E. Rutland St. at E. 21st St.
    E. Rutland St. at N. Vermont St.
    E. 21st St. at S. Jahncke Ave.
    S. Massachusetts at 20th
    E. 20th St. at S. Jahncke Ave.

1. PROJECT BACKGROUND

The Cesar Chavez East Community Design Plan (CCEDP) is a community-supported visioning and design process reimaging the Cesar Chavez corridor
between Hampshire Street in the Mission District to Illinois Street in the Dogpatch neighborhood as a safe, comfortable and accessible street for the
adjacent residents and businesses. The CCEDP would extend the planned streetscape enhancements currently being constructed on the western portion of
Cesar Chavez between Guerrero Street and Hampshire Street. The approximate plan area boundary is shown in Figure 1.

As the flattest and most continuous roadway in the area, Cesar Chavez connects the Mission District, Potrero Hill, Bernal Heights, Bayview and Dogpatch
neighborhoods and serves as a vital link to the Blue Greenway and Bay. The CCEDP identifies short-term and long-term solutions to make Cesar Chavez a
multimodal corridor that accommodates pedestrians, bicyclists, cars, and trucks and that can offer recreational, ecological, and cultural opportunities for
people who live and work in the area. The project is an interagency effort led by the Planning Department, with support from the San Francisco Municipal
Transportation Authority (SFMTA), San Francisco City and County Transportation Authority (the Authority) and Department of Public Works (DPW), funded
by a California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Environmental Justice: Context Sensitive Design Program Grant.

While the CCEDP focuses on short-term solutions, the Planning Department also sought to develop longer-term solutions for the Cesar Chavez-Potrero-
Bayshore-US 101 interchange area (herein "the Hairball") shown in Figure 2. The purpose of this longer-term interchange area planning study is to
evaluate the potential opportunities to improve circulation within the interchange area for all travel modes. The Hairball was given focused attention due to
the complexity of the existing transportation network and the magnitude of solutions being envisioned for the area. The CCEDP identifies short-term
solutions for the interchange to improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety, address concerns about personal safety in the existing pathways, and generally
make the area more consistent with the streetscape improvements planned on either side of the interchange.

The Hairball study discussed in this report addresses long-term changes to the area that require coordination with Caltrans, including reconfiguration of the
existing ramp structures, modification of vehicle circulation through the interchange, and new pedestrian and bicycle paths through the area. Specifically,
this transportation options analysis reviews existing conditions in the Hairball project study area, identifies and analyzes three potential redesign options,
and provides an evaluation framework for identifying the key benefits and constraints of the proposed options.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS

During the CCEDP process, circulation within and through the Hairball was identified as a critical concern for the community. This section describes the
existing vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation within the Hairball.

ROADWAY NETWORK

As presented in Figure 2, the Hairball is the junction of three major arterial city streets ­
Cesar Chavez, Bayshore Boulevard, and Potrero Avenue ­ and the freeway on- and off-
ramps from U.S. 101. There are also several smaller, local streets within the interchange
area that provide local access to nearby residential and industrial neighborhoods.

The Potrero Avenue-Bayshore Boulevard corridor is the historical surface alignment of
major north-south traffic through the area between the Bayview, Mission District, and
South of Market neighborhoods prior to the construction of the US 101 viaduct in the
1950s (Image 1). The corridor continues to be a primary vehicle route through the area,
serving nearly 40,000 vehicles through the interchange on a typical weekday on four to
six travel lanes. Both Potrero Avenue and Bayshore Boulevard are considered major
arterials1 within the San Francisco General Plan and are included in the City's Congestion
Management Program (CMP) and Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS) roadway
networks. The corridor is also a major transit corridor and a secondary transit street
within the General Plan. The 9/9L Bayshore bus routes, major crosstown transit lines,
travel north-south through the interchange from the Bayview and Visitacion Valley
neighborhoods to Downtown. Bayshore Boulevard is a designated Class III bicycle route
and Potrero Avenue is has striped Class II bicycle lanes; however, as discussed under
existing bicycle conditions, there is no direct bicycle route through the interchange area.

from and to the freeways; these are routes generally of citywide significance; of varying capacity depending       (source: GoogleEarth)
on the travel demand for the specific direction and adjacent land uses.

                                                                                                                                                       February 2012


Cesar Chavez (formerly Army Street) is the primary east-west corridor between the Mission District, Potrero Hill, and Central Waterfront neighborhoods.
East of the Cesar Chavez/US 101 interchange, Cesar Chavez has two lanes in each direction and serves as the primary gateway to the mostly industrial
southeastern portion of San Francisco from the US 101 and I-280 freeways. West of US 101, Cesar Chavez is a six lane major arterial through the mostly
residential and commercial Mission and Noe Valley neighborhoods. The off-ramps from US 101 provide access to both directions of Cesar Chavez;
however, there is no direct access from eastbound Cesar Chavez to northbound US 101 or from westbound Cesar Chavez to southbound US 101. These
movements are currently accommodated by making other non-direct movements, including using Kansas Street and Marin Street and the Potrero-
Bayshore southbound ramp to access US 101 Northbound and making a U-turn at Bryant Street to access US 101 Southbound. Circuitous routes are
generally not considered favorable access to state freeway facilities. Cesar Chavez is considered a major arterial within the San Francisco General Plan and
is included in the City's Congestion Management Program (CMP) and Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS) roadway network.

The Department of Public Works (DPW) has begun implementing a streetscape master plan (Image 2) for Cesar Chavez between the Hampshire Street
and Guerrero Street. The street segment is currently under construction, and the plan includes reducing the number of travel lanes to two lanes in each
direction, left turn pockets at key intersections, a planted median, and Class II bicycle lanes. The streetscape improvements would stop at Hampshire Street.
The Planning Department is currently working on designing the enhancements that would extend from Hampshire Street to Illinois Street.

February 2012


One of the primary vehicle circulation challenges in the area is access to and from
the two major arterial corridors and the US 101 on- and off-ramps. The following
sets of schematic drawings (Image 3) indicate the permitted and restricted
movements in the Hairball area. As indicated, the following movements are not
currently possible for vehicles to make:

    1.   Westbound Cesar Chavez to Northbound Potrero Avenue

    2.   Eastbound Cesar Chavez to Northbound Potrero Avenue

    3.   Southbound Potrero Avenue to Eastbound Cesar Chavez

    4.   Southbound Potrero Avenue to Northbound US 101

    5.   Eastbound Cesar Chavez to Southbound US 101

    6.   Northbound Bayshore Boulevard to Southbound US 101

Although possible, the movement from eastbound Cesar Chavez to Northbound US
101 requires vehicles to make three successive right turns on Kansas Street and
Marin Street.

                                                                           from the northbound off-ramp to surface streets require using Bayshore Boulevard
                                                                           and ramp connections through the Hairball. As a result, northbound Bayshore
                                                                           Boulevard has seven lanes of traffic approaching the interchange area at Jerrold
                                                                           Street.

                                                                           Vehicle Wayfinding

                                                                   Within the interchange, the vehicle connections tend to be confusing and
                                                                   circuitous, requiring drivers to make quick decisions about when and where to turn
                                                                   to reach their preferred direction. For example, within 400 feet , or five seconds, of
                                                                   exiting southbound US 101, drivers choose between a Potrero-Cesar Chavez ramp
                                                                   and a Bayshore-Cesar Chavez Ramp. Within 500 feet, or six seconds, of the initial
                                                                   split, drivers must choose between northbound Potrero or westbound Cesar
                                                                   Chavez and between southbound Bayshore or eastbound Cesar Chavez. Similarly,
                                                                   southbound Potrero splits into three separate ramps ­ westbound Cesar Chavez,
                                                                   southbound US 101, and southbound Bayshore. The northbound Bayshore
                                                                   Boulevard approach to the interchange is marked with lanes designated feeding
into westbound Cesar Chavez, northbound Potrero, eastbound Cesar Chavez, and northbound US 101. Signage indicating the appropriate eastbound
Cesar Chavez to southbound Bayshore Boulevard is limited and immediately proceeds the US 101 southbound on-ramp.

Existing Traffic Operations

Vehicle traffic through the Hairball is heavy, but is generally free-flowing, consistent with the existing configuration of the ramps. Field observations indicate
that some congestion occurs on the southbound US 101 on-ramp, where the Potrero and Cesar Chavez ramps leading to the freeway mainline merge. The
shore merge causes vehicles to slow before entering the acceleration lane on the freeway. Congestion also occurs frequently at the Bayshore/Jerrold/US
101 Off-Ramp intersection. Traffic counts were conducted on every roadway, on-ramp and off-ramp in the Cesar Chavez/US 101 interchange study area.
Existing daily, AM and PM peak hour vehicle volumes are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

Cesar Chavez-Potrero-Bayshore/US 101 Interchange Study
February 2012


The following key points emerge from the existing data:

     1.   Cesar Chavez west of the interchange has an average daily volume of about 52,000 vehicles per day; east of the interchange, the average daily
          volume drops to about 30,000 vehicles per day.
     2.   Traffic on Cesar Chavez tends to be directional, with higher eastbound volumes during the AM peak hour and higher westbound volumes during
          the PM peak hour.
     3.   The Potrero-Bayshore connection serves about 17,300 vehicles per day; however, the northbound connection carries most of that daily volume, or
          about 11,800 vehicles per day.
     4.   Approximately 24,000 vehicles per day access US 101 Southbound via the Potrero and Cesar Chavez On-Ramps at the interchange. Similarly,
          about 22,000 vehicles per day access US 101 Northbound via Bayshore Boulevard or Cesar Chavez.
     5.   The US 101 Southbound Off-Ramps to Cesar Chavez and Bayshore serve approximately 21,400 vehicles per day. The US 101 Southbound off-
          Ramp to Potrero Northbound serves about 2,200 vehicles per day.
     6.   Several ramps had afternoon peak hours that occurred between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, immediately before the standard PM peak period (3:00 PM
          to 7:00 PM) and slowly decreased volume until the end of the peak period. The data suggest that the interchange is active throughout the day,
          and not just during peak hours.

Truck Traffic

The Hairball serves a substantial volume of heavy vehicle and truck traffic traveling to and from US 101 and the southeastern industrial waterfront areas and
San Francisco Port. The data collected in 2010 show that about 10 percent of all vehicles in the area are heavy vehicles. This substantial heavy vehicle
volume is important as both an economic condition and for design considerations. SFMTA designates Cesar Chavez as a truck traffic route east of the
Hairball. Within the Hairball, clearance is limited to 14 feet 5 inches under the US 101 overpass.

                                                                                       Class II (Bicycle Lanes) are striped lanes on roadways designated for use by

Hairball. Bicycle facilities are comprised of bike paths, bike lanes and bike
routes. Eastbound bicyclists use a multi-use path along the southern edge of           Class III (Bicycle Routes) are designated roadways for shared bicycle/vehicle use
the Hairball. The path crosses over the ramp serving the Cesar Chavez to               indicated by signs only; may or may not include additional pavement width for
                                                                                       cyclists. The majority of San Francisco's bicycle facilities are Class III facilities. In
Bayshore Boulevard movement, then cyclists use a signalized crosswalk at the           San Francisco, Class III Bicycle Routes are routinely striped with the shared-lane

at the US 101 off-ramp to Cesar Chavez. The eastbound path is shared with
pedestrians.

Westbound bicyclists can use a bicycle bridge between the northbound US 101
on-ramp and Bayshore to Potrero ramp before merging with traffic on the
Bayshore to Cesar Chavez ramp. The lack of a striped bicycle lane and mixing
zone at the northbound US 101 on-ramp makes merging onto the bicycle
bridge from the east challenging for less-confident bicyclists. Likewise, bicyclists
merging onto Cesar Chavez on the west side of the bicycle bridge must
interact with fast moving traffic from the Bayshore to Cesar Chavez ramp.

Northbound and southbound bicyclists have few options in the Hairball, and no direct connection exists in either direction. Bicycle lanes are striped on
Potrero Avenue beginning at the Hairball; however, no bicycle facilities are signed or striped on the ramps through the interchange. Northbound cyclists
can share the road with traffic on Bayshore Boulevard, cross over the interchange on the Bayshore ramp and merge onto Potrero Avenue like cars do
today. Alternatively, bicyclists can use the sidewalk path along the eastern edge of the Bayshore to northbound US 101 ramp, cross at an unsignalized
crossing at Vermont Street, and use the bicycle lanes of Vermont Street to go to 23rd Street and Potrero Avenue. This route is also available to southbound
bicyclists from Potrero to Bayshore. Although this route is less trafficked, it is approximately 1,300 feet longer and requires climbing a hill (Vermont Street)
compared to a straight connection between Bayshore and Potrero.

February 2012


Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian access through the Hairball is limited. Similar to bicyclists, pedestrians have no direct north-south connection from Bayshore Boulevard to
Potrero Avenue. East-west access is also limited to the multi-use path on the south side of Cesar Chavez. Pedestrian access on the edges of the study area
is also limited. To the east, pedestrians cross at the Kansas Street signal. On the west, pedestrians must use the pedestrian overcrossing at Hampshire
Street. The nearest crosswalk on the northern edge of the study area is at Potrero Avenue/25th Street. Pedestrians are permitted along the northern
sidewalk between Hampshire Street and Potrero Avenue; however, the crosswalk across the Potrero US 101 off-ramp is unsignalized, non-ADA compliant,
and has limited sight distance.

EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE

SFMTA provides Muni transit service (Figure 7) within San Francisco. Two bus routes ­ the 9 Bayshore and 9L Bayshore Limited pass through the Hairball,
but do not stop at Cesar Chavez. There is no east-west transit service along Cesar Chavez. Several transit routes operate near the Hairball, but do not pass
through or stop in the study area, including the 10 Townsend, 33 Stanyan, 48 Quintara, 19 Polk, and 8X Bayshore Express.

RELATIONSHIP TO PLANNED PROJECTS

The Hairball is located near several on-going land use development projects that may affect traffic and circulation through the area. In particular, the Cesar
Chavez corridor is a major gateway into the Candlestick Point-Hunters Point Shipyard Phase II project area and is the southern boundary of the Eastern
Neighborhoods area. Both of these projects would increase the number residents and jobs in the southeastern and eastern waterfront of the City.

Candlestick Point-Hunters Point Shipyard Phase II

For almost 20 years, the Candlestick Point area and the Hunters Point Shipyard in San Francisco have been in the planning phase to transform a former
naval shipyard and surrounding industrial area into a modern, mixed-use, transit-oriented neighborhood with over 10,500 new homes, parks, and nearly
30,000 new jobs. The land use plan incorporates a dense, compact development pattern centered on mixed-use transit nodes. To accommodate this
growth, the project includes transit, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements, including roadway improvements between the Hairball and Hunters Point.

Eastern Neighborhoods

The Eastern Neighborhoods Land Use Plan and Transportation Study and
Environmental Impact Report analyzed the potential impacts associated
with the rezoning of major portions of the eastern neighborhoods of San
Francisco. The Eastern Neighborhoods' Plan forecasted future growth in
four major subareas in the eastern portion of San Francisco. The area
would grow by nearly 10,000 new housing units and over one million
square feet of employment space.

The Hairball would be the southern-most gateway into this area, and
Cesar Chavez would be a primary east-west corridor for the residents and
businesses in the area.

Potrero Annex and Terrace

Potrero Annex and Terrace are located along a steep ridge at the southern edge of San
Francisco's Potrero Hill. The 33-acre developments, built in two phases, the first in 1941
and second in 1955, are home to approximately 1,200 people. The Potrero Annex and
Terrace sites are being revitalized as part of the City of San Francisco's HOPE SF program a
partnership between the Mayor's Office of Housing and the San Francisco Housing
Authority aimed at revitalizing distressed public housing developments. In 2008, BRIDGE
Housing Corporation and its affiliate BUILD were selected to lead the redevelopment
effort. The development team plans to replace all public housing apartments and integrate
additional affordable and market-rate homes into the community along with amenities
such as open space, neighborhood services, and retail opportunities. The project would be
located with access from Cesar Chavez at Connecticut Street.

Future Traffic

To forecast future traffic conditions in the interchange area, the San Francisco Travel Demand Model, the SF-CHAMP maintained by the San Francisco
County Transportation Authority (SFCTA), was reviewed. The SF-CHAMP model is a sophisticated model that takes land use, socioeconomic characteristics,
and the transportation system, including local and regional roadway capacity and transit service, and creates a synthetic population to determine travel
characteristics throughout the City. SF-CHAMP accounts for variables including employment type (e.g., Industrial, Service, Hospitality), US Census
demographic data, and documented travel characteristics of San Francisco residents and visitors. The model tracks each person 's trips through the day to
determine origin and destination pairs, travel routes, and mode choice. The model has been developed to be sensitive to the dense mix of land uses and
transportation options (including transit, walking and biking) within the City and linked trips (i.e., a person can't drive to work, walk to the store, and take
transit home for the day - the modes in a chain must be consistent). The SFCTA routinely updates and validates the model when new data about
population, housing characteristics, and employment projections are available.

Post-processing of SF-CHAMP model output to determine Future Year volumes for the U. S. Highway 101-Bayshore-Portrero-Cesar Chavez interchange
project is summarized in Appendix X.

After a travel demand model is run, outputs include the assigned roadway traffic in the form of "loaded networks." Upon receipt of the loaded networks
from the SFCTA, roadway segment volumes in the Project study area were be reviewed to ensure that the magnitude and direction of roadway changes
were logical. For example, if a TAZ is coded with extensive land use changes, then nearby roadway segments would likely have volume shifts as a result.
Likewise, the roadway network will be reviewed to assess whether the roadways where new trips were assigned was logical. In travel demand forecasting

models, trips are generally assigned to the route with the shortest expected travel time. Roadway speed, capacity, and facility type play a role in the
attractiveness of a given route. Upon review, if roadway segment volumes are illogical (i.e., the roadway seems attractive but does not have any new trips,
or all new trips are being assigned to a local roadway), then nearby routes are evaluated to see whether there are any attributes that made adjacent
facilities more or less attractive than the roadway in question. Model outputs that are found to be inconsistent with logic or past experience may require
further investigation, possibly resulting in additional model runs.

In general, the base year model volumes on individual streets produced by SF-CHAMP do not match the existing traffic counts. This is not surprising,
because of the complex network of roadway links within the US 101/Cesar Chavez interchange. Also, the model is a citywide model that has not been
calibrated based on the new data collected in this study. Throughout the Project study area, the model tended to over-estimate the base year traffic
volumes in the area.


Although the model is not precise in estimating individual link volumes, the

Since the SF-CHAMP model output tends to be irregular though the
interchange, a hybrid approach was used to develop future year forecasts for the individual links in the study area. First, annual percentage growth for each
link was calculated from the model. As described earlier, these rates were generally consistent with the development expected to occur in the study area
over the next 25 years. Based on the growth rates observed in the SF CHAMP model, an average annual growth rate of 0.7 percent was developed by
averaging the growth rates for AM and PM peak hour conditions.

3. DESIGN OPTIONS

The San Francisco Planning Department, SFMTA, and the Authority developed three design options for the Hairball based on community feedback during
the CCEDP process in 2010. The options reflect community concerns with pedestrian and bicycle access through the existing Hairball overpass ramps and
agency concerns with coordinating any future redesign of the interchange with Caltrans. The three selected design options are shown below.

                                                                        February 2012


    OPTION A: TIGHT (DIVERGING) DIAMOND INTERCHANGE

    Option A, as shown to the left, would remove all of the existing ramp
    structures and replace the interchange with a tight diamond interchange.
    The existing northbound US 101 off-ramp touchdown would be
    relocated from the intersection of Bayshore and Jerrold to Cesar Chavez.
    The southbound on-ramp would be located at the southbound off-ramp
    touchdown near the freeway viaduct. Potrero and Bayshore Avenues
    would be a continuous city surface street adjacent to the interchange.

    A diverging diamond interchange, or DDI, is a type of diamond
    interchange that uses crossover movements at the ramp intersections.
    The design was chosen for this option because it could allow for fewer
    lanes on Cesar Chavez compared to a normal tight-diamond
    interchange. All turns to and from ramps are right-turns (eliminating the
    need for left-turn storage), and the intersections can be operated with
    two phases instead of three. The DDI configuration would likely provide
    higher capacity than a standard diamond configuration, but Caltrans
    would require additional traffic analysis to determine if it is the superior
    alternative to a standard diamond.

    Pedestrian Accessibility and Safety

    This Option improves pedestrian circulation by consolidating ramps at
    Cesar Chavez, providing sidewalks on the sides of all of the surface
    streets, and reducing the number of conflict points where vehicles yield
.
    to pedestrians. The Option also reduces the vehicle capacity of the
    Bayshore and Jerrold intersection, thereby improving access to the
    businesses on the west side of Bayshore Boulevard near the study area.
    However, by replacing ramps with surface streets, the Option would
    increase pedestrian delay through the interchange and increase the
    number of vehicle lanes that a pedestrian would have to cross in one
    movement. For example, pedestrians at the intersection of Potrero/Cesar
    Chavez would have to cross up to seven lanes of traffic.

                                                                                  21

Given the complexity of the area, some special considerations should be       Sample Dual-Right On-Ramp with Advance Limit Lines

made to accommodate pedestrians in the design of this option.

Crosswalks could be provided on all four intersection approaches at the
Potrero-Bayshore/Cesar Chavez intersection, since this intersection
would become a local intersection and the crosswalks would serve land
uses on all four quadrants around the intersection. Similarly, crosswalks
could be included on all four approaches of the Bayshore/Jerrold
intersection and Kansas/Cesar Chavez intersection.

At the ramp intersections, crosswalks could be provided across the ramp
approaches (to accommodate east-west travel); however, crosswalks
across Cesar Chavez would not serve adjacent land uses and may
decrease vehicle capacity. A crosswalk could be provided on the east
side of the eastern ramp interchange to serve the north and south

As the options are refined, accommodating transit could be a priority for
this corridor. One potential enhancement to minimize impacts to transit
is to retain a fly-over ramp but convert it to a transit-only use, along the
Bayshore-Potrero corridor.

Implementation

Option A would generally be considered an attractive design option
because it creates a tight-diamond interchange; however, the diverging
diamond configuration is a new interchange design for Caltrans. This
may require exceptions and documentation for the design process,
which would extend the approval process for any changes to the
interchange. There are no diverging diamond interchanges in California;
however, these designs are functional in Missouri and Utah.

Option A would require major reconstruction of the northbound off-
ramp to bring the touchdown to Cesar Chavez, the redesign of the
Bayshore/Jerrold intersection, and educational campaigns to education
the public about driving through the interchange design.

All Options require major demolition, reconstruction, and staging to
accommodate the proposed redesigns; therefore, this option is not a
distinguishing factor in the evaluation.

OPTION B: SINGLE POINT URBAN INTERCHANGE

Option B, shown to the left would remove the existing ramp structures
and consolidate the northbound on-ramp, southbound on-ramp, and
southbound off-ramp into a single-point interchange ("SPUI") under the
US 101 viaduct. The northbound off-ramp would remain at the Bayshore
and Jerrold intersection. To facilitate movement between the interchange
at Cesar Chavez and Bayshore, a bypass would be constructed between
the SPUI and Marin Street.

While SPUIs can minimize the right of way required for overall ramp
designs, they do not accommodate pedestrian crossings very effectively
and often create challenges for bicyclists with their numerous conflict
points and high speed turns. A SPUI generally has a very large area of
uncontrolled pavement in the middle of the intersection, and traffic
signals need a longer yellow and red phase to clear the intersection,
making the timing insufficient for a bicyclist entering late on green or in
the yellow phase to make it across the intersection. Additionally, because
of all the movements served with a single traffic signal, a separate phase
is not typically available for pedestrians to cross the arterial without
conflict.



Pedestrian Accessibility and Safety

Option B provides direct and logical pedestrian connections between
Potrero Avenue and Bayshore Boulevard and between the eastern and
western portions of Cesar Chavez. The interchange ramps have been
consolidated; however, the size of the interchange causes the area to
remain dominated by vehicle traffic destined to and from the ramps.
Additionally, keeping the northbound off-ramp at Bayshore/Jerrold does
not provide opportunities to enhance the pedestrian realm south of the
Hairball. Furthermore, a pedestrian would have to cross eight lanes of
traffic at Potrero Avenue.

                                                                             27
Cesar Chavez-Potrero-Bayshore/US 101 Interchange Study
February 2012




Given the complexity of the area, some special considerations should be
made to accommodate pedestrians in the design of this option.
Crosswalks north-south across Cesar Chavez should be placed at the
adjacent intersections (e.g., Potrero and Kansas) since there are not
pedestrian-activated land uses expected under the freeway and access
can be more safely accommodated in these locations.

The inset to the right illustrates a schematic design for a SPUI
interchange. Given the expected pedestrian and vehicle volumes in this
location, the crosswalks at the ramps should be signalized.

Bicycle Accessibility and Safety

Option B provides direct bicycle connections through the interchange
and would separate bicyclists from vehicle traffic where feasible.
However, bicyclists may need to share some crossings with pedestrians.
More advanced cyclists may choose to travel on-street, rather than in
off-street paths, since the crosswalks at the interchange would require
them to mix with pedestrians and make less direct movements.
Additionally, the northbound bicycle route would continue to be
challenging, since bicyclists would need to either share the lane with
vehicles or use the side path/crosswalks.

Thus, bicyclists should be accommodated through skip striping within a
SPUI. Due to the large, uncontrolled intersection area, SPUIs can be
difficult for drivers who are unfamiliar with the interchange types..

Land Use

This option provides the largest and most connected access to the
interior portions of the Hairball. This space could be used for wastewater
wetlands or for passive or active recreation space. It could also be used
as parking for the surrounding industrial uses.

Implementation

Although this design may consist of standard surface streets, it is not a
typical interchange configuration. Given the complexity of the street
system and the volume of traffic in the area, it would not be a
straightforward design during the Caltrans approval process.

This option may require the reconstruction of US 101 and the
construction of a particularly steep southbound on-ramp. However, most
of the roadways would be surface roadway and the northbound off-
ramp would not need to be reconstructed.

All Options require major demolition, reconstruction, and staging to
accommodate the proposed redesigns; therefore, this option is not a
distinguishing factor in the evaluation.

4. OPTION EVALUATION

The Cesar Chavez East Project Team developed a set of goals for the study area and the interchange specifically. Using this set of goals, an evaluation
framework was developed to compare the alternative interchange re-design options. This framework includes criteria and specific metrics that can be
generated for each criterion.

The evaluation process involves an assessment of how each of the proposed design alternatives meets the performance measures associated with each of
the suggested criteria. The criteria include feasibility factors including, but not limited to: travel conditions through the interchange by all modes, cost, and
implementation, including the process for obtaining Caltrans design approvals. Table 4 scores each Option with arrow signs representing a high score
when comparing the option to the existing condition. The appendix contains the complete evaluation criteria matrix, as well as the information that was
used to develop the scoring next to each category. This evaluation is not intended to identify a preferred option, rather, the results indicate areas where
each design might need additional refinement or considerations.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS

This document presents a high-level transportation planning study of three potential re-envisioned options for the Cesar Chavez-Potrero-Bayshore/US 101
interchange area. The three options evaluated ­ the diverging diamond, the half SPUI, and the signaled rotary ­ present a departure from the current aerial
structures that dominate the transportation system in the Hairball area. Although the three options presented would fundamentally change the area, this
study identified key challenges that each option has if carried forward. Specifically,

    1.   Each option creates a substantial increase in vehicle delay through the study area. Although an increase in vehicle delay can sometimes be a
         benefit to other uses ­ notably in instances where auto capacity is given up for pedestrian or bicycle facilities ­ the vehicle delay in the options
         presented occur even though the roadways are wide and accommodate additional vehicles, as well as pedestrians and bicyclists. As shown in the
         option figures in Chapter 3, many of the options have roadway segments with six or eight lanes of traffic at an intersection where a pedestrian
         would be crossing. Additionally, the lanes of traffic would necessitate an off-street bicycle path, since an on-street bicycle facility might be
         uninviting to less confident cyclists.

    2.   Each option creates a substantial decrease in transit travel speeds and subsequent increase in transit delay. The Potrero-Bayshore corridor is a
         critical north-south transit corridor that is expected to grow in importance as growth in southeastern San Francisco occurs. Although the options
         presented here can accommodate transit and transit preferential treatments (e.g., contra-flow transit lanes and signal timing), the elimination of an
         aerial, unsignalized ramp system to a surface street system creates delay for transit. If or when these options move forward, transit treatments that
         minimize or eliminate (e.g., a direct aerial ramp connector) transit delay should be considered.

    3.   The ultimate preferred option will need to undergo a thorough evaluation to meet Caltrans engineering and design requirements. The options
         presented in this report are not currently standard designs for the state freeway system, and each would require some level of design exception.
         Option 1, the diverging diamond, is the closest to a typical Caltrans design ­ the tight diamond interchange. It is likely that this option would need
         to show clear benefit over a traditional tight diamond interchange before being carried forward in a Caltrans process.

    4.   Creation of a surface street system was a goal because surface streets improve access to adjacent land. To some extent, the options presented in
         this study improve access; however, the capacity needed to accommodate future vehicle demand and truck demand create large surface
         roadways that may reduce the desirability of the land opened up by the interchange re-design options.

    5.   As mentioned, the surface streets in the options create imposing crossings and facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. One key advantage of the
         existing system of pedestrian and bicycle ramps is that pedestrians and bicyclists can move through the area uninterrupted and separate from
         high-volume and high-speed traffic. Though a surface street system may slow vehicle speeds, pedestrians and bicyclists would still be required to
         interface with a substantial vehicle volume.


                                                                                                                                                                 35

     6.   Design options and signal timing inputs were developed so as not to increase queues on off-ramps (to avoid mainline impacts). However,
          additional refinements to the traffic microsimulation model would be needed to confirm that the redesign does not affect mainline operations.

     7.   None of the options developed provide the level of benefit to pedestrians and bicyclists or improve the quality and potential use of adjacent land
          to such an extent that they would justify the enormous expense associated with reconstructing the Hairball. There are circumstances that could
          occur in the future, including need to replace aging Hairball structures, which could change this conclusion.



This study reveals particular challenges to this interchange study area. If or when the project moves forward into the Caltrans project study report (PSR)
process, the options presented here may need to be further refined in concept before being analyzed in any further detail.

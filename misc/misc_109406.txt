                 Introduction and Summary

                 Introduction
                 This report presents the results of TJKM's traffic impact analysis for the proposed expansion of
                 Hillbrook School which is located at 300 Marchmont Drive in the Town of Los Gatos. The existing
                 Hillbrook School (a K-8 private school), is proposing an expansion of the school enrollment from the
                 current 315 students to 414 students, an increase in enrollment of 99 students. The school is not
                 expecting to build additional classrooms or buildings at the project site. The access to the school
                 site is via Marchmont Drive only and this roadway ends at the school entrance. Figure 1 illustrates
                 the project location and its vicinity. Figure 2 shows an aerial photo of the existing school site.

                 Summary
                 Based on the current school peak hour trip data, the proposed project expansion (an increase in
                 student enrollment by 99 students) is expected to generate 98 a.m. peak hour trips (53 inbound
                 trips and 45 outbound trips) and 84 school p.m. peak hour trips (42 inbound trips and 42 outbound
                 trips) in addition to the existing trip counts.

                 Currently, all study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service during the a.m. peak hour
                 and the school p.m. peak hour (LOS D or better).

                 All the study intersections are expected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS
                 D or better) for the Existing plus Approved, Existing plus Project, Background (Existing +
                 Approved) plus Project and Background (Existing + Approved) plus Project plus Pending Conditions
                 scenarios.

                 Based on queuing analysis, the vehicle accumulation of drop-off/pick-up activity is expected to be
                 contained within the school site during both a.m. and p.m. school peak hours with the proposed
                 increase in school enrollment.

                 The following are the recommended traffic improvement measures for the proposed project:
                     ·    TJKM recommends that the project applicant prepare and implement a more thorough,
                          aggressive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan to improve the current
                          procedures as specified in the "Hillbrook School Handbook". Some of the TDM measures
                          may include proactive plans to encourage carpooling and transit use, including strong
                          incentives, staggered drop-off/pick-up schedules for students, etc.
                     ·    The intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue is timed and
                          coordinated with the intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Shannon Road. With additional
                          trips from the project, these two signals should be re-timed to maximize the efficiency of
                          signal coordination.

                 Intersection Analysis Methodology

                 Intersection Analysis Methodology
                 The following seven intersections were selected by Town staff for the traffic analysis:
                     1. Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue (Signalized)
                     2. Los Gatos Boulevard/Shannon Road (Signalized)
                     3. Shannon Road/Englewood Avenue (One-way Stop Control)
                     4. Englewood Avenue/Marchmont Drive (One-way Stop Control)
                     5. Englewood Avenue/Kennedy Road (All-way Stop Control)
                     6. Shannon Road/Hilow Road (Two-way Stop Control)
                     7. Marchmont Drive/Hilow Road (All-way Stop Control)

                 The following five scenarios were addressed in this study:
                    1. Existing Conditions ­ Current (Year 2011) traffic volumes and roadway conditions.
                    2. Existing plus Approved (Background) Conditions ­ Current (Year 2011) traffic volumes and
                         roadway conditions with the addition of traffic from approved developments within the
                         Town of Los Gatos.
                    3. Exiting plus Project Conditions ­ Current (Year 2011) traffic volumes and roadway
                         conditions with traffic added just from the proposed project expansion.
                    4. Background plus Project Conditions ­ Identical to Background Conditions, but with traffic
                         added from the proposed project expansion.
                    5. Background plus Project plus Pending Conditions ­ Identical to Background plus Project
                         Conditions, except for additional (forecasted) traffic from future pending projects within
                         the Town of Los Gatos.

                 Level of Service Analysis Methodology
                 The operating conditions at all the study intersections were evaluated using the 2000 Highway
                 Capacity Manual (HCM) Operations Method contained in TRAFFIX software. The default
                 saturation flow rates were adjusted to comply with the Congestion Management Program (CMP)
                 methodology, adopted by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). Peak hour
                 intersection conditions are reported as average delay in seconds per vehicle with corresponding
                 levels of service (LOS). A level of service ratings is qualitative descriptions of intersection
                 operations and is reported using an A through F letter rating system to describe travel delay and
                 congestion. Level of Service A indicates free flow conditions with little or no delay and LOS F
                 indicates jammed conditions with excessive delays and long back-ups. The methodology is
                 described in detail in Appendix A.

                 Significant Impact Criteria
                 The Town's level of service standard is LOS D. Intersections that fall below LOS D are considered
                 impacted and should be considered for mitigation. Also, the proposed project is considered to
                 have a significant impact if it causes the levels of service for the study intersections to drop more
                 than one level if it is at LOS A, B, or C, and drop any further if it is at D or worse.

                 Existing Traffic Conditions

                 Level of Service Analysis
                 Peak hour turning movement counts at the study intersections were conducted in May2011 when
                 the Hillbrook School was in regular session. Based on the traffic counts, the school's peak hours
                 are morning peak from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and afternoon school peak from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
                 Raw traffic counts and 85th percentile speed data are provided in Appendix B. Figure 3 illustrates
                 the existing lane geometry, traffic control, and the peak hour turning movement volumes at the
                 study intersections. A graphic illustrating a summary of average daily traffic (ADT) counts is
                 provided in Appendix B. Table I summarizes the results of the intersection analysis under Existing
                 Conditions. The detailed LOS calculations (TRAFFIX Output) are contained in Appendix C.

                 Under the Existing Conditions, all study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service
                 (LOS D or better). During the a.m. peak hour, the intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/
                 Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue operates at LOS D with noticeable vehicle queuing on both
                 Los Gatos Boulevard and Kennedy Road. The congestion due to queuing is particularly visible
                 during the peak 15-minute interval of the school peak periods. Currently, the signal at this
                 intersection is timed and coordinated with the intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Shannon Road.
                 With additional trips from the project, these signals should be re-timed to maximize the efficiency
                 of signal coordination.

                 At the Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue intersection, TJKM staff observed a
                 queue length of approximately 19 vehicles on Kennedy Road during a peak 15-minute interval of
                 the a.m. peak hour. This observed queue length is within the range of the 85th-percentile queue
                 length as reported in the detailed LOS calculations in Appendix C.

                 Roadway Conditions on Marchmont Drive
                 Currently, Marchmont Drive/Hilow Road, a gateway intersection to the school site, is a four-legged
                 unsignalized intersection with an all-way stop control. Marchmont Drive runs in the east-west
                 direction and Hilow Road runs in the north-south direction. Marchmont Drive is a two-lane
                 roadway with a posted speed limit of 25 mph between Englewood Avenue and Hilow Road and
                 15 mph between Hilow Road and the school entrance.

                 During the a.m. and the school p.m. peak periods, the queuing conditions were observed at the
                 critical study intersections. TJKM staff performed peak hour queue and delay studies at Marchmont
                 Drive/Hilow Road intersection. Based on the field studies, during the a.m. peak hour, the average
                 stop delay is approximately ten seconds per vehicle with a maximum observed queue of two
                 vehicles. It should be noted that these field observations are in same range as the HCM analysis
                 results and they are shown in Appendix C.

                 The capacity for a roadway is governed by a traffic control device (such as a stop sign or a traffic
                 signal) at an intersection, where a vehicle has to stop/wait for its turn. The first Stop control for
                 Marchmont Drive outside the school gate is at Hilow Road and currently the overall average
                 intersection delay is at 7.9 seconds (LOS A) during both the a.m. and the school p.m. peak hour
                 conditions.

                 85th Percentile Speed on Study Roadways
                 The speed at (or below) which 85 percent of the vehicles are observed to travel under free flowing
                 conditions on a roadway is termed as 85th percentile speed. TJKM collected machine count data
                 and 85th percentile speed data for six study locations and the speed data is summarized as shown in
                 Table II. In general, the 85th percentile speed for the study roadways is well within acceptable limits
                 per State of California standards for setting speed limits. Addition of the project trips along the
                 roadways is not expected to cause higher travel speeds.

                 Existing plus Approved (Background) Conditions
                 This Scenario is similar to Existing Conditions, but with the addition of traffic from the approved
                 developments within the site vicinity. Approved projects consist of developments that are either
                 under construction, are built but not fully occupied, or that are not built but have final development
                 approval from the Town.

                 Based on recent communication with the Town staff, the following eighteen approved projects are
                 expected to generate some traffic through the study intersections:
                     1. 15940 Blossom Hill Road (residential)
                     2. 15881 Linda Avenue (residential)
                     3. 371 Los Gatos Boulevard (residential)
                     4. 55 Los Gatos Saratoga (retail/office)
                     5. 15720 Winchester Boulevard (office development replaces a single-family home)
                     6. 14881 National Avenue (medical office development replaces a single-family home)
                     7. 15400 Los Gatos Boulevard (office/retail)
                     8. 16005 Los Gatos Boulevard (mixed-use)
                     9. 950 University Avenue (self-storage)
                     10. 15928 Union Avenue (residential)
                     11. Samaritan Way (medical office)
                     12. Town Library (new library replaces the existing library)
                     13. 55 Placer Oaks (single-family housing)
                     14. 16213 Los Gatos Boulevard (residential replaces auto dealership)
                     15. 800 Blossom Hill Road (senior adult residential)
                     16. Albright Way Development (office and residential)
                     17. 930 University Avenue (soccer complex)
                     18. 106 Town Terrace (single family residential)

                 These projects are expected to add a total of 1,196 vehicular trips during the commute a.m. peak
                 hour and 921 trips during the school p.m. peak hour in the Town of Los Gatos street network.

                 Level of Service Analysis (Existing plus Approved (Background) Developments)
                 Figure 4 illustrates the Existing plus Approved turning movement volumes and Table III summarizes
                 the results of the intersection analysis. The detailed LOS calculations are contained in Appendix D.

                 Based on the traffic analysis, the increase in average delay at the study intersections is limited (less
                 than three seconds of average delay). Under this scenario, all study intersections are expected to
                 continue to operate at acceptable conditions (LOS D or better).

                 Project Conditions Analysis

                 Existing plus Project Conditions
                 This Scenario is identical to the Existing Conditions, but with added traffic from the proposed
                 project expansion of Hillbrook School.

                 The existing Hillbrook School (a K-8 private school), is proposing an expansion of the school
                 enrollment from the current 315 students to 414 students, an increase of 99 students. The school
                 is not expecting to build additional classrooms or buildings at the project site. The access to the
                 school site is via Marchmont Drive only and this roadway ends at the school entrance.

                 TJKM reviewed Hillbrook School Handbook that provides detailed information on the current
                 procedures on carpooling, shuttle service, traffic and parking, student drop-off and pick up etc.
                 Based on this document, it is noted that the afternoon school peak has a staggered dismissal
                 schedule to alleviate the traffic queuing issues. Junior Kindergarten and Kindergarten classes are
                 dismissed at 2:45 p.m. and the parents are required to pick up their children by 3:00 p.m. Grades
                 one through four are dismissed at 3:00 p.m. and the parents are required to pick up their children
                 by 3:15 p.m. Similarly, grades five through eight are dismissed at 3:15 p.m. and the students are
                 required to be picked up by 3:30 p.m.

                 Project Trip Generation
                 The trip generation for the current land use, a K-8 private school estimated based on rates provided
                 in Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
                 are compared with the traffic counts conducted at the school entrance. Table IV shows the
                 summary of comparison between ITE based trip rates and the observed peak hour trip counts.

                 TJKM conducted a week-long hose counts for Marchmont Drive near the school gate during May
                 2011 and the trip counts shown on Table IV are for the highest day of the study week. TJKM
                 estimated the proposed project trips by extrapolating the five-year average (historical) counts (See
                 tail end of Appendix B for historical counts). This results in a higher number of a.m. peak hour and
                 school p.m. peak hour trips than the ITE peak hour trip rates. Table V shows the summary of
                 project trip generation estimates for the a.m. and the school p.m. peak hours.

                 The proposed project expansion (an increase in student enrollment by 99 students) is expected to
                 generate 98 a.m. peak hour trips (53 inbound trips and 45 outbound trips) and 84 school p.m.
                 peak hour trips (42 inbound trips and 42 outbound trips) in addition to the existing trip counts.

                              Projected counts were used to assign project trips at the study intersections for traffic analysis.

                 License Plate Survey
                 A license plate survey was conducted to obtain travel route information of Hillbrook School bound
                 trips within the study neighborhood streets. In this survey method, travel route information was
                 obtained by stationing one or more observers at each entrance and exit of the study area to record
                 the time and license plate information of each vehicle as it passes the observation station. The
                 license plate numbers are matched later and the travel route/time information for the study
                 roadways are summarized. Generally, video cameras and notepads are used to record the license
                 plate survey data.

                 As part of the project, TJKM and Quality Counts (traffic data collection firm/sub-consultant) were
                 tasked with collecting the license plate data during the regular a.m. and the school p.m. peak hours
                 at the following nine locations:
                     ·    Marchmont Drive west of Hillbrook School Entrance
                     ·    Ferris Avenue south of Loma Street
                     ·    Englewood Avenue north of Kennedy Road
                     ·    Marchmont Drive east of Englewood Avenue
                     ·    Stonybrook Drive north of Kennedy Road
                     ·    Kennedy Road east of Stonybrook Drive
                     ·    Englewood Avenue south of Shannon Road
                     ·    Hilow Road south of Shannon Road
                     ·    Shannon Road west of Bonnie Lane

                 The license plate data includes the license plate numbers, color of the vehicles, type of the vehicle
                 and the time stamp of the inbound and the outbound vehicles at each of the survey locations. The
                 raw data was thus processed to track the peak hour inbound and the outbound trip movement
                 along the study road segments. The summarized license plate survey data in combination with the
                 peak hour turn movement counts was used to determine existing school traffic travel patterns to
                 help assign the project trips to the study intersections. The summarized license plate survey results
                 are provided in Appendix E of this report.

                 Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
                 Trip distribution assumptions for the proposed project were developed based on existing travel
                 patterns, license plate survey data, knowledge of the study area and the input from Town staff.
                 Traffic from the proposed project is expected to travel to and from the site according to the
                 distribution assumptions shown on Figure 5 and described below:
                     ·    20 percent will travel to/from the north via Winchester Boulevard
                     ·    10 percent will travel to/from the west via Los Gatos Saratoga Road (Highway 9)

                                                                                                                              Page 13

                     ·      20 percent will travel to/from north via SR 17
                     ·      5 percent will travel to/from south via SR 17
                     ·      20 percent will travel to/from the north via Los Gatos Boulevard
                     ·      25 percent will travel to/from the south via Los Gatos Boulevard

                 As the proposed project school-bound trips converge into the study neighborhood streets, the
                 trips were manually distributed for each of the streets and study intersections using the
                 summarized results from License plate survey and the turn movement counts.

                 Traffic Impacts on Neighborhood Streets
                 As shown on Figure 5, the proposed project trips are expected to reach the project site located at
                 300 Marchmont Drive via local residential streets bordered by Los Gatos Blvd, Shannon Road, and
                 Kennedy Road. Among these local residential streets, Marchmont Drive, Hilow Road, and Englewood
                 Avenue are expected to carry majority of the school traffic. Based on the peak hour traffic analysis,
                 the study neighborhood streets and the intersections level of service are expected to remain well
                 within acceptable levels with the proposed increase in school enrollment as shown in Table VI.

                 Level of Service Analysis
                 Figure 6 illustrates the Existing plus Project turning movement volumes. The results of the LOS
                 analysis are summarized in Table VI and detailed calculations are provided in Appendix F. With the
                 addition of project trips, all the study intersections are expected to operate at essentially the same
                 level of service as Background Conditions but with slight increases in average delay at each of the
                 study intersections.

                 Based on the traffic analysis for this scenario, the addition of the project trips at the intersection of
                 Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue is expected to increase the westbound
                 approach queue by one vehicle length during the a.m. peak hour. Similarly, the addition of project
                 trips at the all-way stop control intersection of Marchmont Drive/Hilow Road is expected to
                 increase the queue length by no more than one vehicle at any approach.

                 Pedestrian, Bicycle and Transit Accessibility




                 Hillbrook School currently provides private shuttle service (Durham School Services) for its students
                 on two routes serving Los Altos, Cupertino, Saratoga, Rose Garden, Willow Glen and segments of
                 greater San Jose. The above graphic illustrates the path of the bus routes that serve an approximate
                 total of 50 students as of spring 2011. The school management informed the Town staff that they
                 started the shuttle service as part of new TDM (Transportation Demand Management) program for
                 the year 2010-2011 and they plan to add additional bus routes in the near future to improve their
                 commitment towards TDM measures which aims at reducing school peak hour trips.

                 Currently, there are sidewalks along Los Gatos Boulevard on both sides. There are no sidewalks
                 along the study road segments to the east side of Los Gatos Boulevard near project site and
                 along Marchmont Drive. Currently, the school bound students either walk or bike along
                 Marchmont Drive share the roadway with the traveling vehicles. There are Class II bike lanes
                 along Los Gatos Boulevard in the study area.

                 Based on field observations, Bus Route 49 runs along Los Gatos Boulevard in the vicinity of the
                 project site. Bus Route 49 operates between the Winchester Transit Center and the Los Gatos
                 Civic Center. The nearest bus stops for Bus Route 49 are located on Los Gatos Boulevard at both
                 Shannon Road and Kennedy Road. This project is not expected to cause any significant impact on
                 the transit system in the vicinity.

                 Collision Analysis
                 TJKM reviewed the SWITRS collision reports for the school traffic routes within the local
                 neighborhood streets including Englewood Avenue, Marchmont Drive, Hilow Road, and Topping
                 Way. The collision reports are provided by Town staff for the two-year period of June 2008
                 through May 2010. Only one accident at the Englewood/Kennedy intersection was reported within
                 the reviewed period. Based on the estimated trip rate numbers, the proposed project is expected
                 to have little or no impact on the collision rate (or safety) at the study segments and study
                 intersections.

                 On-site Traffic Circulation and Queuing Analysis
                 Prior to the traffic study, the school site provided three drop-off spots and four waiting aisles.
                 Based on TJKM's suggestion during the course of the current traffic study, the school re-striped the
                 waiting aisles and provided additional drop-off/pick-up spots. Thus, the overall capacity of the
                 service rate for the waiting and drop-off/pick-up zones were improved. TJKM staff conducted on-
                 site traffic circulation observations for the improved site, during the first week of December 2011
                 and the observations are discussed below.


                                      Drop-off/Pick-up Zone




                                                                                                                     Waiting

                 Note - The blue lines indicate the approximate location of the improvements currently in place.

                 During the a.m. peak period between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., the school bound vehicles (driven by
                 the parents of students) drop off students at the designated drop-off location by the school front
                 office. There are five waiting aisles of approximately 130 feet each and the vehicles stack up along
                 these aisles before they enter the drop-off zone. It takes approximately 15 to 22 seconds for a
                 vehicle to drop off a student at each of the five designated drop-off spots. It should be noted that
                 during the peak hour conditions the drop-off zone is managed by the school staff to assist the
                 parents. However, due to the stacking nature of the drop-off aisle, consisting of a series of five
                 drop-off spots parallel to the curb and sidewalk, on average approximately ten vehicles are serviced
                 per minute (10 vehicles/minute) based on TJKM staff field observations.



                                                                                                                            Page 19

                 Based on the observations and traffic counts made by TJKM staff, during the a.m. peak period the
                 vehicle accumulation is well contained within the school campus for the entire duration of a.m. and
                 the school p.m. peak hours. There were approximately three to four vehicles stacked along the
                 waiting aisles during the peak 15 minutes of a.m. peak hour and similar observations were made for
                 the school p.m. peak hour.

                 Currently, each aisle can hold a maximum of seven vehicles. With the proposed increase in the
                 school enrollment, the expected maximum queue is a total of 24 vehicles for a duration of
                 approximately ten minutes during the morning peak at around 8:00 a.m. In other words, this
                 means an additional three vehicles per aisle is expected with the project expansion. Based on
                 TJKM staff's observations, there is an adequate remaining capacity within the school campus waiting
                 aisles to hold the additional three vehicles per aisle after the school enrollment expansion.

                 During the school p.m. peak period between 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., the parent vehicles begin to
                 arrive at the pick-up zone (which is same as the drop-off zone) and also stack along the waiting
                 aisles. It should be noted that with the existing staggered nature of the p.m. pick-up schedule
                 (as described under project description on page 12), with student groups accompanied by
                 designated school staff to assist the pick-up activity, the queuing conditions are relatively less
                 intense compared to the a.m. peak drop-off activity.

                 Based on queuing analysis, the vehicle accumulation of drop-off/pick-up activity is expected to be
                 contained within the school site during both a.m. and p.m. school peak hours with the proposed
                 increase in school enrollment.

                 Neighborhood Traffic Impact
                 Although there is adequate capacity for the roadway system to accommodate the additional traffic
                 from the proposed 99 new students, TJKM recommends that the school adopt a strong TDM
                 (Transportation Demand Management) plan for reducing the trips and the impact to its minimum
                 possible.

                 The school could prepare and implement a more thorough, aggressive TDM plan to improve the
                 current procedures as specified in the "Hillbrook School Handbook." Some of the TDM measures
                 may include proactive plans to encourage carpooling and transit use, including strong incentives,
                 staggered drop-off/pick-up schedules for students, etc.

                 Background plus Project Conditions

                 This Scenario is identical to the Existing plus Approved Conditions, but with added traffic from
                 the proposed project expansion of Hillbrook School.

                 Level of Service Analysis
                 Figure 7 illustrates the Existing plus Approved plus Project turning movement volumes. The results
                 of the LOS analysis are summarized in Table VII and detailed calculations are provided in Appendix
                 H. With the addition of project trips, all the study intersections are expected to operate at
                 essentially the same level of service as Background Conditions.

                 Background plus Project plus Pending Conditions

                 This Scenario evaluates future conditions with the addition of traffic from pending projects added
                 to Background plus Project traffic. The pending projects are foreseeable developments that are
                 likely to add traffic to the study intersections. According to Town staff, the following ten
                 developments are pending projects:
                      1. North Forty Specific Plan (mixed-use)
                      2. 15500 Los Gatos Boulevard (re-development assumptions for Moore Buick GMC)
                      3. 620 Blossom Hill Road (re-development assumptions for Benteley Silicon Valley)
                      4. 20 Dittos Lane Apartments (residential)
                      5. Twin Oaks (single family residential)
                      6. 16212 Los Gatos Boulevard (residential replaces auto dealership)
                      7. 339-341 Bella Vista (single family residential)
                      8. 135 Riviera Drive (residential apartments expansion)
                      9. 15600 Los Gatos Boulevard (a pharmacy and commercial development)
                      10. 640 Blossom Hill Road (a restaurant)

                 These pending projects are expected to contribute a total of 1,509 vehicular trips during the a.m.
                 peak hour and 1,659 trips during the school p.m. peak hour on the Los Gatos street network.

                 Level of Service Analysis
                 Figure 8 summarizes the Background plus Project plus Pending peak hour turning movement volumes
                 and Table VIII summarizes the results of the LOS analysis. The detailed LOS calculations are contained
                 in Appendix I. With the addition of the pending project trips, all of the study intersections except
                 one are expected to operate at the same LOS as Background plus Project Conditions with a slight
                 increase in delay at each of the study intersections. The exception is the intersection of Los Gatos
                 Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue, which is expected to operate at an acceptable LOS D
                 (previous scenario at LOS C) during the p.m. peak hour under this scenario.

                 Conclusions and Recommendations

                 TJKM has reached the following conclusions regarding the proposed Hillbrook School expansion
                 (student enrollment increase by 99 students) in the Town of Los Gatos:
                     ·    The proposed project expansion (an increase in student enrollment by 99 students) is
                          expected to generate 98 a.m. peak hour trips (53 inbound trips and 45 outbound trips) and
                          84 school p.m. peak hour trips (42 inbound trips and 42 outbound trips) in addition to the
                          existing trip counts.
                     ·    Currently, all study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service during the a.m.
                          peak hour and the school p.m. peak hour. All the study intersections are expected to
                          continue operating at acceptable levels of service for the Existing plus Approved, Existing
                          plus Project, Background plus Project and Background plus Project plus Pending Conditions
                          scenarios.
                     ·    The intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue is timed and
                          coordinated with the intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Shannon Road. With additional
                          trips from the project, these two signals should be re-timed to maximize the efficiency of
                          signal coordination.
                     ·    The proposed project trips are expected to reach the project site located at 300
                          Marchmont Drive via local residential streets bordered by Los Gatos Blvd, Shannon Road,
                          and Kennedy Road. Among these local residential streets, Marchmont Drive, Hilow Road,
                          and Englewood Avenue are expected to carry majority of the school traffic. Based on the
                          peak hour traffic analysis, the study neighborhood streets and the intersections level of
                          service are expected to be well within acceptable levels with the proposed increase in
                          school enrollment.
                     ·    Based on queuing analysis, the vehicle accumulation of drop-off/pick-up activity is expected
                          to be contained within the school site during both a.m. and p.m. school peak hours with the
                          proposed increase in school enrollment.
                     ·    TJKM recommends that the project applicant prepare and implement a more thorough,
                          aggressive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan to improve the current
                          procedures as specified in the "Hillbrook School Handbook". Some of the TDM measures

      DESCRIPTION OF SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION CAPACITY ANALYSIS
                        Updated 2000 HCM METHOD


Background

The operations method of intersection capacity analysis found in Chapter 16, "Signalized
Intersections," of the Highway Capacity Manual 2000, Transportation Research Board, was used
for this study. This method is used in most analyses of existing conditions or of future situations
in which traffic, geometric, and control parameters were well established by projections and trial
designs.

This method addresses the capacity and level of service of intersection approaches, and the level
of service of the intersection as a whole. In this method, capacity and level of service are
evaluated separately, and are not related to each other in a simple one-to-one fashion. Capacity is
evaluated in terms of the ratio of demand flow rate to capacity (volume-to-capacity ratio), while
level of service is evaluated on the basis of control delay per vehicle (sec/veh).

The capacity of the intersection as a whole is not addressed by this method; the design and
signalization of intersections focuses on the accommodation of the major movements and
approaches comprising the intersection. Capacity is, therefore, only meaningful as applied to
these major movements and approaches. Capacity analysis results in the computation of volume-
to-capacity ratios for individual movements and a composite volume-to-capacity ratio for the sum
of critical movements or lane groups within the intersection. The volume-to-capacity ratio is the
actual or projected rate of flow on an approach or designated group of lanes during a peak 15-
minute interval divided by the capacity of the approach or designated group of lanes.

Level of Service

Level of service is based on the control delay per vehicle for various movements within the
intersection. While volume-to-capacity affects delay, there are other parameters that more
strongly affect it, such as the quality of progression, length of green phases, cycle lengths, and
others. Thus for any given volume-to-capacity ratio, a range of delay values my result, and vice-
versa. See the table "Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections" for the relationship
between the level of service and stopped delay per vehicle.

Because delay is a complex measure, its relationship to capacity is also complex. It is possible,
for example, to have delays in the range of Level of Service F while the volume-to-capacity ratios
is below 1.00, perhaps as slow as 0.75-0.85. Very high delays can occur at such volume-to-
capacity ratios when some combination of the following conditions exists: the cycle length is
long; the lane group in question has a long red time; and/or the signal progression for the subject
movement is poor.

The reverse is also possible. A saturated approach or lane group with a volume-to-capacity equal
to 1.00 may have low delays if the cycle length is short, and/or the signal progression is favorable
for the subject movement. Acceptable delay levels do not automatically ensure that capacity is
sufficient. The analysis must consider the results of the capacity analysis module and the level of
service module to obtain a complete picture of existing or projected intersection operations.

                                                                                                                  07/17/02
Thus, the designation of Level of Service does not automatically imply that the intersection,
approach, or lane group is overloaded, nor does a level of service in the A to E range
automatically imply that there is unused capacity available.

The procedures of this methodology require the analysis of both capacity and level of service
conditions to fully evaluate the operation of a signalized intersection.

               DESCRIPTION OF INTERSECTION CAPACITY ANALYSIS
                         UNSIGNALIZED 2000 METHOD


Background

The method of unsignalized intersection capacity analysis used in this study is from Chapter 17,
"Unsignalized Intersections" of the Highway Capacity Manual, Special report No. 209,
Transportation Research Board, updated October 2000.

This method applies to two-way STOP sign or YIELD sign controlled intersections (or one-way
STOP sign or YIELD sign controlled intersections at three-way intersections). At such
intersections, drivers on the minor street are forced to use judgement when selecting gaps in the
major flow through which to execute crossings or turning maneuvers. Thus, the capacity of the
controlled legs of an intersection is based on three factors:

1. The distribution of gaps in the major street traffic stream.
2. Driver judgement in selecting gaps through which to execute their desired maneuvers.
3. Follow-up time required to move into the front-of-queue position.

It is assumed that gaps in the traffic stream are randomly distributed. For this reason, the
methodology will be less reliable in situations in which the conflicting flows are strongly
platooned, as would be the case at many urban intersections where the major street is part of a
signalized network.

This method assumes that major street traffic is not affected by minor street flows. This
assumption is generally good for periods when the operation is smooth and uncongested. (When
congestion occurs, it is likely that major street traffic will experience some impedance due to
minor street traffic.) Left turns from the major street are assumed to be affected by the opposing
major street flow, and minor street traffic is affected by all conflicting movements.

Input Data

The general procedure to calculate the level of service is as follows:

1. Define existing geometric and volume conditions for the intersection under study.
2. Determine the conflicting traffic through which each minor street movement and the major
   street left-turn must cross.
3. Determine the size of the gap in the conflicting traffic stream needed by vehicles in each
   movement crossing the conflicting traffic stream.
4. Determine the capacity of the gaps in the major traffic stream to accommodate each of the
   subject movements that will utilize these gaps.
5. Adjust the capacities found to account for impedance and the use of shared lanes.
6. Estimate the average total delay for each of the subject movements and determine the level of
   service for each movement and for the intersection.


Gaps are utilized by vehicles in the following priority order:


                                                      c:\tjkm\templates\appendices-pleasanton office\unsig. method 2000.doc
                                                                                                                 07/17/2002
1.   Right turns from the minor street
2.   Left turns from the major street
3.   Through movements from the minor street
4.   Left turns from the minor street

For example, if a left-turning vehicle on the major street and a through vehicle from the minor
street are waiting to cross the major traffic stream, the first available gap of acceptable size would
be taken by the left-turning vehicle. The minor street through vehicle must wait for the second
available gap. In aggregate terms, a large number of such left-turning vehicles could use up so
many of the available gaps that minor street through vehicles are severely impeded or unable to
make safe crossing movements.

Level of Service

See the following table "Level of Service Criteria for Unsignalized Intersections" for the
relationship between delay and level of service.

           > 25-35 s/veh                                     D                                    Long traffic delays

              > 50 s/veh                                      F                                 Extreme traffic delay


The level of service criteria for Two-Way STOP controlled intersections is somewhat different
from the criteria used in Chapter 16 for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this is
the difference that drivers expect a signalized intersection to carry higher traffic volumes than
unsignalized intersections. Additionally, several driver behavior conditions combine to make
delays at signalized intersections less onerous than at unsignalized intersections.

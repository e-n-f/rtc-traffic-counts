                                 DAVIDSON, NORTH CAROLINA

1.        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
proposed West Branch Residential Development to be located along the west side of Davidson –
Concord Road south of Concord Road in Davidson, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is
to determine the potential impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic
generated by the proposed development.


The proposed site includes 199 detached single-family homes and 107 townhomes. The project is
expected to be completed by 2018. Access to the site is anticipated via a proposed full access
driveway on Davidson – Concord Road and four proposed full access driveways on Robert Walker
Drive.


The study area for the TIS was determined through coordination with the Town of Davidson and
the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) and consists of the following
intersections:
     1.   Davidson – Concord Road and Concord Road / East Rocky River Road (unsignalized)
     2.   Davidson – Concord Road and Robert Walker Drive (unsignalized)
     3.   Hudson Place and Samuel Spencer Parkway (unsignalized)

                                        WestBranch Residential Development – Traffic Impact Study

Based on coordination with NCDOT and the Town of Davidson, no offsite developments were
determined to have an impact on the project study area. In addition, no approved roadway projects
are expected to be constructed that would have an impact on the project study area.


Several scenarios were analyzed using traffic analysis software. Traffic operations during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours were modeled for each scenario. The results of each scenario
were compared in order to determine impacts from background traffic growth and the proposed
development. The following scenarios were modeled:
   •   2016 Existing
   •   2018 No-Build
   •   2018 Build
   •   2018 Build - Roundabout


Based on the analysis results, minor impacts are expected by the proposed development. No queue
issues are expected. The following improvements have been recommended to be constructed by
the developer:


Davidson-Concord Road and Robert Walker Drive
   •   Construct a southbound right turn lane on Davidson-Concord Road with 125’ of full width
       storage and appropriate taper.


Davidson-Concord Road and Site Drive 1
   •   Construct Site Drive 1 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       the eastbound approach.


Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 2
   •   Construct Site Drive 2 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       the southbound approach.

Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 3
   •   Construct Site Drive 3 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       the northbound approach.


Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 4
   •   Construct Site Drive 4 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       both the southbound and northbound approaches.


Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 5
   •   Construct Site Drive 5 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       both the southbound and northbound approaches.

2.       INTRODUCTION
2.1.     Purpose of Report
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
proposed West Branch Residential Development to be located along the west side of Davidson –
Concord Road south of Concord Road in Davidson, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is
to determine the potential impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic
generated by the proposed development.


2.2.     Study Objectives
The proposed site includes 199 detached single-family homes and 107 townhomes. The project is
expected to be completed by 2018. Access to the site is anticipated via a proposed full access
driveway on Davidson – Concord Road and four proposed full access driveways on Robert Walker
Drive.


Refer to Figure 1 of Appendix A for an illustration of the site location map, and to Figure 2 for the
preliminary site plan. Refer to Appendix A for all figures. The objective of this report is to
determine what geometric improvements are necessary to mitigate traffic conditions on the
transportation network surrounding the site with the proposed development fully built out.


3.       AREA CONDITIONS
3.1.     Transportation Network Study Area
3.1.1.   Area Roadway System
The project study area for this TIS was based on coordination with the Town of Davidson and the
NCDOT. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the roadways within the study area. The
NCDOT Functional Class map was used to determine the classification of each road. Traffic
Volume maps from NCDOT were used to find the average annual daily traffic (AADT) volumes in
vehicles per day (vpd) for the roadways.

3.1.1.1. Existing Roadway Conditions
Existing lane configurations (number of traffic lanes on the intersection approach), storage
capacities, and other intersection and roadway information was collected through field
reconnaissance by Ramey Kemp and Associates, Inc. (RKA). Refer to Figure 3 for the existing
lane configurations and traffic control at study intersections.


3.1.1.2. Future Roadway Conditions
Based on coordination with NCDOT and the Town of Davidson, no offsite developments were
identified to have an impact on the project study area. In addition, no approved roadway projects
are expected to be constructed that would have an impact on the project study area.


3.1.2.     Study Area and Existing Traffic Volumes
The study area for the TIS was determined through coordination with NCDOT and the Town of
Davidson and consists of the following intersections:
    1.     Davidson – Concord Road and Concord Road / East Rocky River Road (unsignalized)
    2.     Davidson – Concord Road and Robert Walker Drive (unsignalized)

       11. Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 4 (unsignalized – full access)
       12. Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 5 (unsignalized – full access)


Existing traffic volumes were determined through traffic counts conducted during the AM peak
period (7:00-9:00 AM) and the PM peak period (4:00-6:00 PM). A copy of the traffic count data
can be found in Appendix B of this report. The peak hour traffic volumes were not balanced
between intersections due to the locations of driveways throughout the network and the traffic at
the study intersections peaking during different time periods.            As suggested by NCDOT
Congestion Management, existing movements with zero volume were converted to four vehicles
per hour to prevent incorrect capacity calculations. Refer to Figure 4 for an illustration of the
existing peak hour traffic volumes.

3.2.        Study Area – Adjacent Land Use
3.2.1.      Existing Land Uses
The existing site is undeveloped. The surrounding land is primarily residential, institutional, and
commercial.

3.2.2.      Anticipated or Approved Future Development
Based on coordination with the NCDOT and the Town of Davidson, no offsite developments were
identified that would affect traffic operations within the study area.

        4.        PROJECTED TRAFFIC
        4.1.      Site Traffic
        In order to determine the future traffic conditions after the proposed development is completed, an
        estimate of traffic projected to travel to / from the proposed development is required. The average
        weekday daily, AM peak hour, and PM peak hour site trips for this study were calculated based on
        the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.


        4.1.1.    Trip Generation
        The average weekday daily as well as AM and PM peak hour site trips for this study were
        calculated based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th
        Edition. Table 2 summarizes the weekday trip generation.

        4.1.2.    Trip Distribution and Assignment
        The primary trip distribution percentages were developed based on existing traffic patterns, nearby
        land uses, employment centers, and engineering judgment. Figure 5 illustrates the proposed site
        trip distribution percentages. These trip distribution percentages were applied to the total new trip
        generation data to calculate the proposed site trip assignments shown in Figure 6. It should be
        noted that due to the geometry of the proposed site driveway, some traffic enters Site Drive 1 and
        travels through to Site Drive 5, and some traffic enters though the Hudson Place internal
        connection and travels to the site drives along Robert Walker Drive.

5.         TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
5.1.       Traffic Analysis Scenarios
Several scenarios were analyzed using traffic analysis software. Traffic operations during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours were modeled for each scenario. The results of each scenario
were compared in order to determine impacts from background traffic growth, and the proposed
development. The following scenarios were modeled:
       •   2016 Existing
       •   2018 No-Build
       •   2018 Build
       •   2018 Build - Roundabout


The 2016 Existing scenario included the traffic characteristics that currently exist in the study area.
Existing peak hour traffic volumes were determined from the intersection counts. No changes to
the existing lane configurations were made. In accordance with the Davidson Planning Ordinance
pedestrian and bicycle movements were included for all intersections.


The 2018 No-Build scenario was analyzed to determine the expected future traffic operations. A
compounded growth rate of 2% per year was used to project the exiting traffic volumes to the
future volumes. These projected volumes represent the 2018 No-Build peak hour traffic volumes
found in Figure 7. No changes to the existing lane configurations were made. In accordance with
the Davidson Planning Ordinance pedestrian and bicycle movements were included for all
intersections.


The 2018 Build scenario was compared to the 2018 No-Build scenario to determine expected
impacts caused by traffic created by the proposed site. This scenario included the same
assumptions as the 2018 No-Build scenario. The trips expected to be generated by the proposed
site (Figure 6) were added to the 2018 No-Build peak hour volumes (Figure 7) to determine the
2018 Build peak hour traffic volumes. Refer to Figure 8 for the 2018 Build peak hour traffic
volumes. No changes to the existing lane configurations were made. In accordance with the
Davidson Planning Ordinance pedestrian and bicycle movements were included for all

intersections. Recommendations for improvements to the development were included in the traffic
models.


The 2018 Build – Roundabout scenario was included based on discussions with the Town of
Davidson requesting analysis of the intersection of Davidson-Concord Road and Robert Walker
Drive as a roundabout.


5.2.      Traffic Analysis Procedure
All study intersections (both unsignalized and roundabouts) were analyzed using the methodology
outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research
Board. The computer software packages, Synchro 9.1, SimTraffic 9.1, and Sidra Intersection 5.1
were used to complete the analyses for all of the study area intersections. Synchro was developed
by Trafficware Corporation and allows the user to input data into the Synchro software and
calculate the output based on methodologies in the HCM. SimTraffic creates a traffic simulation
model from the Synchro inputs. SimTraffic was used in this study to determine expected queue
lengths. Sidra Intersection 5.1 is a software package developed by Sidra Solutions that is used to
analyze roundabouts. Sidra was used to model and analyze the existing roundabout at Davidson-
Concord Road and Concord Road and the proposed conversion of the existing Davidson-Concord
Road and Robert Walker Drive intersection into a roundabout.


Analysis results for roundabout intersections provide delay, and level of service (LOS) for all
movements and approaches. The overall intersection delay, and LOS is also provided.           The
capacity analysis for an unsignalized intersection does not provide an overall LOS for the
intersection, but rather a LOS for movements and/or approaches that have a conflicting movement.


The HCM defines capacity as “the maximum hourly rate at which persons or vehicles can
reasonably be expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a given
time period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions”. LOS is a term used to
represent different driving conditions, and is defined as a “qualitative measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream, and their perception by motorists and/or




                                                 9
                                         WestBranch Residential Development – Traffic Impact Study

passengers”. LOS varies from Level “A” representing free flow, to Level “F” where greater
vehicle delays are evident.


Refer to Table 3 for HCM levels of service and related average control delay per vehicle for both
signalized and unsignalized intersections. Control delay as defined by the HCM includes “initial
deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay”. As shown in
Table 3, an average control delay of 40 seconds at a signalized intersection results in a LOS D
operation.

5.3.       Mitigation Guidelines
NCDOT has guidelines for determining when improvements may be needed by the developer. The
District Engineer is responsible for the final determination of the improvements. NCDOT typically
requires mitigation to be identified when developments are expected to impact the traffic
operations as described below:
       •   Overall intersection or intersection approach delay increases by 25% or more.
       •   LOS degrades by at least one level
       •   LOS is F
       •   Synchro 95th or SimTraffic maximum queue results are greater than the existing turn lane
           storage length

    5.4.     Capacity and Level of Service at Study Intersections
    5.4.1.   Davidson-Concord Road and Concord Road / East Rocky River Road
    The intersection of Davidson-Concord Road and Concord Road was analyzed as a three-leg
    roundabout with existing lane configurations. Table 4 summarizes the capacity analysis results.
    Refer to Appendix C for the Sidra reports for this intersection. All SimTraffic reports can be
    found in Appendix O.


    Analysis indicates that the intersection will operate at an acceptable LOS in the 2018 Build
    scenario. The addition of site traffic is expected to have a minor effect on the operation of the
    intersection. Minimal increases in delay and queues are expected. SimTraffic results show no
    queuing issues at the intersection. No improvements are recommended.

5.4.2.   Davidson-Concord Road and Robert Walker Drive
The intersection of Davidson-Concord Road and Robert Walker Drive was analyzed as a four-leg
unsignalized intersection with existing lane configurations. Table 5 summarizes the capacity
analysis results. Refer to Appendix D for the Synchro reports and NCDOT turn warrants for this
intersection. All SimTraffic reports can be found in Appendix O.


Analysis indicates that the intersection will exceed the threshold for mitigation in the 2018 Build
scenario. The addition of site traffic is expected to increase the delays on the eastbound approach.
In order to mitigate the impacts caused by the addition of the site traffic, it is recommended that a
southbound right turn lane with 125 feet of full storage and adequate tapper be constructed at the
intersection.


Additional analysis intersection was performed using a roundabout as the traffic control at the
intersection per discussions with the Town of Davidson. Analysis results that the single lane
roundabout will operate efficiently under future build conditions. With a constant growth rate of
2%, the roundabout will operate effectively for 19 years before reaching capacity. Although the
construction of a roundabout would accommodate future traffic needs, the conversion of this
intersection to a roundabout is not recommended due to the high cost of construction, impact to
neighboring properties, and the fact that no significant queues are expected at this intersection
under build conditions as an unsignalized intersection.

         5.4.3.       Hudson Place and Samuel Spencer Parkway
         The intersection of Hudson Place and Samuel Spencer Parkway was analyzed as a three-leg
         unsignalized intersection with existing lane configurations. Table 6 summarizes the capacity
         analysis results. Refer to Appendix E for the Synchro reports for this intersection. All SimTraffic
         reports can be found in Appendix O.


         Analysis indicates that the intersection will operate at an acceptable LOS in the 2018 Build
         scenario. The addition of site traffic is expected to have a minor effect on the operation of the
         intersection. Minimal increases in delay and queues are expected. SimTraffic results show no
         queueing issues at the intersection. No improvements are recommended.

         5.4.7. Bailey Springs Drive and Bradford Park Drive
         The intersection of Bailey Springs Drive and Bradford Park Drive was analyzed as a three-leg
         unsignalized intersection with existing lane configurations. Table 10 summarizes the capacity
         analysis results. Refer to Appendix I for the Synchro reports for this intersection. All SimTraffic
         reports can be found in Appendix O.


         Analysis indicates that the intersection will operate at an acceptable LOS. The addition of site
         traffic is expected to have a minor effect on the operation of the intersection. Minimal increases in
         delay and queues are expected. SimTraffic results show no queueing issues at the intersection. No
         improvements are recommended.

         5.4.8. Davidson-Concord Road and Site Drive 1
         The intersection of Davison-Concord Road and Site Drive 1 was analyzed as a three-leg
         unsignalized intersection. Table 11 summarizes the capacity analysis results. Refer to Appendix J
         for the Synchro reports and NCDOT turn warrants for this intersection. All SimTraffic reports can
         be found in Appendix O.


         Analysis indicates that the intersection will operate at an acceptable LOS in the 2018 Build
         scenario. SimTraffic results show no queueing issues at the intersection. According to NCDOT
         warrants for left and right turn lanes, no turn lanes at the intersection are warranted. Based on
         preliminary field analysis, the location of this driveway provides approximately 475’ of sight
         distance on the northbound approach which meets the acceptable levels for a 45 mph road. Further
         verification will be needed once the final location of the site drive is set. It is recommended that
         Site Drive 1 be constructed with one ingress lane and one shared left / right egress lane.

         5.4.11. Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 4
         The intersection of Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 4 was analyzed as a four-leg unsignalized
         intersection. Table 14 summarizes the capacity analysis results. Refer to Appendix M for the
         Synchro reports for this intersection. All SimTraffic reports can be found in Appendix O.


         Analysis indicates that the intersection will operate at an acceptable LOS in the 2018 Build
         scenario. SimTraffic results show no queueing issues at the intersection. After reviewing NCDOT
         warrants for left and right turn lanes, no turn lanes on Robert Walker Drive at the intersection are
         recommended. It is recommended that Site Drive 4 be constructed with one ingress lane and one
         shared left / through / right egress lane.

         5.4.13. Pedestrian and Bicycle Impacts
         The construction of the WestBranch Residential Development will not have an adverse effect on
         the existing levels of service for pedestrian and bicycles. The proposed development is expected
         to increase the number of pedestrian and bicycle volumes within the area surrounding the
         development; however sidewalks will be constructed along the frontage of development on Robert
         Walker Drive and Davidson-Concord Road increasing the pedestrian and bicycle connectivity
         throughout the surrounding area.

6.         CONCLUSIONS
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
proposed West Branch Residential Development to be located along the west side of Davidson –
Concord Road south of Concord Road in Davidson, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is
to determine the potential impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic
generated by the proposed development.


The proposed site includes 199 detached houses and 107 townhomes. The project is expected to
be completed by 2018. Access to the site is anticipated via a proposed full access driveway on
Davidson – Concord Road and four proposed full access driveways on Robert Walker Drive.


6.1.       Summary of Recommended Improvements
Based on the analysis results, minor impacts are expected by the proposed development. No queue
issues are expected. Refer to Figure 9 for the recommended lane configurations. The following
improvements have been recommended to be constructed by the developer:


Davidson-Concord Road and Robert Walker Drive
       •   Construct a southbound right turn lane on Davidson-Concord Road with 125’ of full width
           storage and appropriate taper.


Davidson-Concord Road and Site Drive 1
       •   Construct Site Drive 1 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
           the eastbound approach.


Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 2
       •   Construct Site Drive 2 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
           the southbound approach.

Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 3
   •   Construct Site Drive 3 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       the northbound approach.


Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 4
   •   Construct Site Drive 4 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       both the southbound and northbound approaches.


Robert Walker Drive and Site Drive 5
   •   Construct Site Drive 5 as a full access driveway with one ingress and one egress lane on
       both the southbound and northbound approaches.

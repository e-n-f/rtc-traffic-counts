Introduction
Frank Sinatra Drive from 4th Street to 11th Street is a 3,700-foot-long, curvilinear, scenic waterfront
corridor with magnificent views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline. Over the past century,
Hoboken’s waterfront has been transformed from an industrial and maritime shoreline marked by
warehouses and finger piers to a post-industrial landscape marked by office buildings, esplanades, and
public open spaces. This section of Frank Sinatra Drive remains the only unfinished portion of Hoboken’s
re-envisioned and revitalized waterfront.
To the west, Frank Sinatra Drive is bounded by the Stevens Institute of                  speeding and pose a danger to bicyclists and pedestrians due to the lack of

Historic and Cultural Resources
From the first American brewery to the first baseball game, Hoboken has been the site of many historic
events since the early 1600s. A review of the site files of the New Jersey State Museum Bureau of
Archaeology revealed that there are no archaeological sites within the boundaries of the project area;
however, the following resources are located along or near Frank Sinatra Drive and should be taken into
account when planning for the future of the corridor. The full text of the cultural resources study
conducted for this visioning effort can be found in the Appendix.

Traffic, Safety, and Parking Analysis
The Federal Complete Streets Act of 2009 states that a Complete Street is “... a roadway that
accommodates all travelers, particularly public transit users, bicyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, to
enable all travelers to use the roadway safely and efficiently.” By using a holistic approach that considers
the needs of all users, as well as the context of the surrounding urban form, Complete Streets can
become a community amenity and asset.
Today, Frank Sinatra Drive acts more like a bypass road between downtown                A lack of adequate sight distance around the horizontal curves at Castle Point
and uptown Hoboken than a scenic route designed for recreation and                      poses a safety issue. The existing geometry of the roadway was reviewed and

  Opportunities
  Widening sidewalks, continuing a dedicated bikeway, and creating safe
  pedestrian crossings are all significant opportunities within this zone.
  Traffic calming along Frank Sinatra Drive would improve pedestrian safety.
  Selective clearing and trimming of the overgrown vegetation along the
  west sidewalk would enhance the natural quality and encourage
  pedestrian use of that edge.

  Potential repurposing of the Union Dry Dock site may offer new
  opportunities for improving public access along the waterfront and
  through the street corridor. Connecting the Waterfront Walkway between
  the Skate Park and Maxwell Park would complete a system of continuous
  pedestrian circulation along Hoboken’s waterfront.

  Constraints
  At present, the private ownership and current use of the Union Dry Dock
  site precludes public use of the site. Until future use is determined, this
  site remains off limits. The widening of the sidewalks would require the
  loss of on-street parking spaces which may be problematic. In terms of
  storm resiliency, this zone is in FEMA zone AE, which means all
  improvements would require a robust stormwater strategy and the ability
  to respond to inundation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This study is done as part of the “Frank Sinatra Drive Envisioning and Conceptual Design Plan,” a
study that was begun in March 2014 at the request of the City of Hoboken (the City). The Prime
Contractor for this study is Kimley-Horn and Associates of Princeton, New Jersey (Kimley-Horn),
which has assembled a project team comprised of various disciplines.

Frank Sinatra Drive between 4th Street and 11th Street is a 3,700’-long, curvilinear, scenic waterfront
corridor that allows significant views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline. The use of the
Hoboken’s waterfront has undergone several dramatic transformations over its almost 175 years of use
during the early years of the United States. In the early 1800s, it was a scenic and recreational
destination; in the late-19th and early-20th Centuries, it evolved into the center of shipping piers and
industrial warehouses. Its current iteration is marked by office buildings, esplanades and public open
spaces, thanks to several redevelopment projects. The seven-block section of Frank Sinatra Drive that
is the subject of this study remains the only unfinished portion of Hoboken’s re-envisioned and
revitalized waterfront.

The City wishes to apply its “Complete Streets” policy and the best practices of street design to
integrate safer bicycling and walking paths along Frank Sinatra Drive to encourage a variety of public
uses. Of special importance to this study, the City also seeks to enhance the aesthetic and recreational
value and sense of place by including such streetscape design features as interpretive signage, among
other amenities.

The firm of Mary Delaney Krugman Associates, Inc. (MDKA) is the Project Team’s Historian and
Historic Preservation Specialist, aided by William Sandy, Registered Professional Archaeologist. This
study of cultural resources found along Frank Sinatra Drive is part of the larger analysis of existing
conditions being compiled by the Kimley-Horn team.

The MDKA team identified the environmental setting of the area, considered aspects of its geology,
recited the findings of previous studies of the area’s prehistory, and traced the area’s historical
development from the early 19th Century to the present.

Based on its historical research and compilation of other background data, the MDKA team identified
three previously identified historic resources that are in, or contiguous to, the project area that are
worthy of special note: the Stevens Historic District (SHPO Op. 1991); Sybil’s Cave (SHPO Op.
2009); and Elysian Park (also part of Stevens Historic District).

MDKA also identified several individual cultural resources that were not included in previous
inventories, i.e., 1) Castle Point Lookout(within the Stevens Historic District) on the Stevens Institute
of Technology campus overlooking the FSD and the waterfront park; 2) an unmarked iron artifact (n.
d.), near eastern sidewalk at north end of Sinatra Park Soccer Field at 5th Street and FSD; 3) the
Serpentine Rock bluff below Castle Point, along FSD; and 4) various masonry retaining walls (one at
the foot of 5th Street that connects it to FSD (pre-1891); one near the foot of 7th Street at FSD (pre-
1909); the section of serpentine rock ashlar wall below the Castle Point Lookout (1857); and other
masonry walls that extend from foot of 9th to Elysian Park (sections pre-1904, some pre-1909, some
pre-1923).

                                                                              Page 7 of 27


Finally, the MDKA team identified several cultural resources that were less than 50 years old: 1)
Castle Point Skate Park, 1101 FSD; 2) Frank Sinatra Memorial Park (1998); 4th Street and FSD; 3)
Memorial, “We the Surviving Workers”(n. d.), Union Dry Dock Yard , FSD between Ninth and Tenth
Streets; 4) WWII Memorial (2008, Dean Marchetto, Arch.), 4th Street at FSD; and 5) Walkway and
Fishing Pier, foot of 8th Street and FSD (ca. 2009, Dean Marchetto, Arch.). As these features are less
than 50 years old, they may have potential as cultural landmarks, but only if found to have only if they
are of "exceptional importance," or if they are integral parts of districts that are eligible for listing in
the National Register, as per the evaluation criteria of the National Register of Historic Places. To date,
this evaluation has not been undertaken. However, given their potential cultural significance, any
action that would alter, remove, or relocate these sites should necessitate an evaluation for any adverse
effects on the resource or the area.

With regard to archaeological resources, MDKA recommends that, before any conceptual plans are
finalized, this preliminary study of the existing conditions regarding cultural resources be expanded
into a full Phase IA cultural resource background study. That Phase IA can then be used to predict
archaeologically sensitive areas, and to evaluate any archaeological remains that might be encountered
in later phases of the project.

With regard to cultural resources (including archaeological sites, historic resources, identified
resources less than 50 years of age, and historically significant landscape features), it is recommended
that, any proposed plans to disturb archaeologically sensitive sites, or alter, demolish, or relocate
cultural resources in or adjacent to the project area be reviewed by a qualified historic preservation
specialist so as to provide its comments and recommendations with regard to specific proposed
activities that may affect these resources, so as to minimize, mitigate, or avoid adverse effects. After
that initial cultural resource review, proposed plans should be submitted to the Hoboken Historic
Preservation Commission for its review and comment. Such reviews are not specifically included in
this envisioning process, and should be included as plans progress.

OVERVIEW

This study is done as part of the “Frank Sinatra Drive Envisioning and Conceptual Design Plan,” a
study begun in March 2014 at the request of the City of Hoboken (the City). The Prime Contractor for
this study is Kimley-Horn and Associates of Princeton, New Jersey (Kimley-Horn), which has
assembled a project team comprised of various disciplines.

Frank Sinatra Drive (FSD) between 4th Street and 11th Street is a 3,700’ long, curvilinear, scenic
waterfront corridor that allows significant views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline (Location
Maps 1 and 2; Photo 1). The use of the Hoboken’s waterfront has undergone several transformations,
first being a scenic and recreational destination in the 1800s, which was transformed by the early 20th
Century into the site of shipping piers and industrial warehouses, and evolved ultimately to its current
iteration, marked by office buildings, esplanades and public open spaces. The section of Frank Sinatra
Drive now undergoing scrutiny remains the only unfinished portion of Hoboken’s re-envisioned and
revitalized waterfront.

The City wishes to apply its “Complete Streets” policy and the best practices of street design to
integrate safer bicycling and walking paths along Frank Sinatra Drive to encourage a variety of public
uses. The City also wishes to incorporate green infrastructure and low impact development strategies,
as well as improve the ecological value of the corridor through a “Green Streets” approach. Finally,
the City seeks to enhance the aesthetic and recreational value and sense of place by including such
streetscape design features as pedestrian-oriented lighting; street furniture; kiosks; bulletin boards;
trash receptacles; wayfinding, gateway and interpretive signage; and other amenities.

The firm of Mary Delaney Krugman Associates, Inc. (MDKA) is the Project Team’s Historian and
Historic Preservation Specialist, aided by William Sandy, Registered Professional Archaeologist. This
study of cultural resources found along Frank Sinatra Drive is part of the larger analysis of existing
conditions being compiled by the Kimley-Horn team.

METHODOLOGY

For the first step of the MDKA data-gathering effort for existing conditions along Frank Sinatra Drive,
William Sandy, the Project Archaeologist, conducted a review of the materials on file at the New
Jersey State Museum, the primary repository for the state’s archaeological data, reviewed the reports
of previous archaeological investigations of the area, and reviewed materials in his own collections for
relevant data of the project area. Mary Delaney Krugman, Principal Historic Preservation Specialist of
MDKA, conducted a file review at the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office, which is the
repository for a number of cultural resource studies associated with past projects proposed for the
current project area. Ms. Krugman conducted historic map and photograph research at the Hoboken
Public Library, thanks to the assistance of its helpful staff, the digital collections of the Hoboken
Historical Museum, as well as various online repositories and the collections of MDKA. MDKA also
provided Kimley-Horn with its compilation of tax map data showing ownership of the various parcels
in the project area. MDKA is also grateful to Paul Somerville, long-time member of the Hoboken
Historic Preservation Commission and local avocational historian. Ron Hine, Executive Director of
Fund for a Better Waterfront, both of whom provided the team with valuable information about the
project area.

Ms. Krugman and Mr. Sandy conducted pedestrian reconnaissance in the project area and took digital
photographs to document existing conditions relevant to this study, and also took part in the walk-
through of the project area with the other members of the Kimley-Horn team, members of the City’s
staff, and representatives of Stevens Institute of Technology, which owns several parcels of land in the
project area along the waterfront.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Hoboken is located south of the south end of the extensive Palisades Sill (Wolfe 1977: Figure 9-1).
The Palisades outcrop stretches for 80 miles along the New Jersey side of the Hudson River,
comprising a prominent ridge in the northeast part of the Piedmont Lowland physiographic province.
The Palisades are largely composed of columnar igneous basalt columns formed as intrusive rock
between the sedimentary strata. Underlying Stevens Tech, and apparent along much of the west side of
Frank Sinatra Drive, is vivid green serpentine bedrock. Serpentine is an altered rock made of a hydrous
silicate of magnesia and the finer grades are marbles (Sturgis 1902:485).

The Hudson River at this location is a subsequent stream that follows the strike of the weak rock belts.
The modern Hudson River, and much of the project area, is underlain by silt, sand, and boulders of the
ancient Hudson River Gorge (Wolfe 1977:252).

PREHISTORIC SENSITIVITY

A review of the site files of the New Jersey State Museum’s Bureau of Archaeology revealed that there
are no registered archaeological sites within the boundaries of the project area.

There have been a number of archaeological background studies and investigations in Hoboken and
vicinity (e.g. Greenhouse 1999, 2003; Historic Research 1978, 1980; Parsons 1991; Raber 1986;
Sullebarger Associates 1991; Richard Grubb 1996, 2012; Geismar 1998). This study has included a
sample of this previous research for insights into what has been found by the previous studies.

One study noted that Hoboken (also known by its Indian name Hopoghan Hackingh was the site of a
trail junction with links to Manhattan Island near 8th Street, Stevens Institute, and the Hudson River
(Geismar 1998: 25). Hopoghan Hackingh reportedly translates to “land of the tobacco pipes”
(Sullebarger 1991:27). This may be a reference to the serpentine bluffs, which a history of Hudson
County reported was the source of Indian pipestone (Van Winckle 1924).

Limited excavations in the uplands in nearby Weehawken found an undated projectile point of local
igneous rock (Greenhouse 1999). Early in the 20th Century, ten Precontact sites and a Contact site
were documented in southern Jersey City. They included “camp sites” and shell middens. Projectile
points included types now known to date to the Archaic and Woodland Periods. All sites are more than
one mile south of Frank Sinatra Drive (Skinner and Schrabisch 1913; Richardson 1935a, 1935b,
1935c; Greenhouse 2003).

HISTORICAL GEOLOGY

The Castle Point serpentine was likely the first source of serpentine rock found in New Jersey. It was
first noted in the journals of Hendrik Hudson made during his 1609 voyage to “New Netherlands” on
his ship, Half Moon. On Friday, October 2, 1609, the Half Moon anchored near “a cliffe that looked of
the colour of a white greene." This cliff is one of the most accurately located landmarks in Hudson's
river voyage as it was, without doubt, the green serpentine outcrop at Castle Point, Hoboken (Hall
1909: 824).

The Philadelphia Centennial Exhibit of the State Geological Survey included “Serpentine and
Magnesite” from Hoboken (Cook 1876). A landmark study of the geology and minerals of the Castle
Point serpentine outcrop was published in 1882 (Darton 1882). By 1890, geologists listed seven
different sources of “Serpentine, Hydrous silicate of Magnesium” in New Jersey, including Hoboken,
and sites in Morris, Sussex, Warren, and Passaic Counties (Canfield 1890).

Serpentine rock is quite rare, occurring in only a few places in the United States. During the late 18th
and early 19th Century, it was first used as a building stone – a period some have called the Folk Period
– and used by 19th and early 20th Century American builders who favored vernacular architecture and
polychromy as late as 1931 (Dorchester 2001). 1 It is especially notable in this location, not only for
drawing the attention of Henry Hudson, but also because it was used to picturesque effect by the
Stevens family in its development of its estate and grounds at Castle Point. Two serpentine stone gates
on Castle Point were erected circa 1856 to mark the entries into the Stevens Estate -- one at Sixth
Street near the river (Photo 8), which is still visible from FSD; the other at Eighth and Hudson Streets
(no longer extant). In the project area itself, the Stevens family used the serpentine stone to construct
the ca. 1857 retaining wall along FSD that supports Castle Point Lookout (Photos 10 – 12) (Krugman
2002). As such, the raw serpentine bluff that still glints green along FSD is an important natural
feature in the project area.

HISTORY OF RIVER WALK / RIVER ROAD / FRANK SINATRA DRIVE

The project area is located in Hoboken, Hudson County, which was formed from Bergen County in
1840. The Township of Hoboken had been part of the township of North Bergen in Bergen County
since 1683. In 1849, it was “set off” from North Bergen, and by 1855, the municipality was
incorporated at the City of Hoboken (Snyder 1969:75, 146, 151).

Colonel John Stevens purchased “Hobocken” tract of 276 acres along the Hudson River once owned
by Loyalist William Bayard. After confiscation, the large tract was bought by Col. John Stevens in
1784 (Grubb 1996: Fig. 12B; Geismar 1998:26). Stevens was very eager to foster development in the
area. He built the first wharves at Hoboken in 1804, the same year that Edwin Stevens, son of the
Colonel, made the family’s private grounds available to the public as an enticement to settling there
(Grubb 2012: 3-2).

  Dorchester defines the periods during which serpentine rock was used as a building stone as The Folk Building Period
(1727-1843), the Conservative Building Period (1843-1867), the Monumental Building Period (1867-
1895), and the Final Building Period (1895-1931).

John Stevens built his substantial home called “Stevens Castle” on the promontory at Castle Point in
1814 (Grubb 1996: 6-6) (Photo H-4). By 1824, the Stevens family ferries were bringing large numbers
of day-trippers to Hoboken to enjoy the “semi-public” grounds of the Stevens Estate (Grubb 2012).
Stevens also extended the “River Walk” (Photo H-1) - later known as River Road and now FSD - from
the ferry terminal at the southern end of Hoboken northward along the Hudson River and around
Castle Point for some two miles so that visitors could appreciate the remarkable vista up the river and
across to the City of New York.

The Stevens family continued to develop a playground unequaled in the metropolitan area of its day.
In the early 1830s, the Stevens family decided to upgrade the landscaping of the riverfront and created
“Elysian Fields,” which opened as a public pleasure ground. It extended along the Hudson River
waterfront from Fifth to Eleventh Streets (1873 G. M. Hopkins, Atlas of Hudson County, cited in
Grubb 1996; Grubb, 2012: 3-4). By the following year, Elysian Fields attracted some 20,000 visitors
per day during the summer (Grubb 2012: 3-4). It was said to be the site of the very first baseball game
in 1846 (Geismar 1998:26). As if the skyline and the vistas weren’t enough for the visitors, in 1836
they created “Sybil’s Cave, a man-made attraction along the waterfront that featured a cave with a
fresh water spring (Photos H-5 to H-8) (Geismar 1998: 26). In 1846, the New York Yacht Club,
located at the north end of Elysian Fields near what is now 10th Street and Frank Sinatra Drive, hosted
the America’s Cup Race, the first international yachting completion (Grubb 2012: 3-14). The boat
basin where the NYYC was based gradually grew more commercial later in the 19th Century, so that
by 1905, piers and ferries replaced private yachts (Photo H-14). Small boathouses for private vessels
were still found on the southern end of Castle Point, near the foot of 4th Street (Photo H-10).

The serpentine bluffs at Castle Point were quarried during the mid-19th Century. They were used by
the Stevens family in the erection of a number of structures on their estate. It was the source of the
stone used for the Sixth Street gatehouse for the Stevens Estate (Photo 8), and for the gate at Hudson
Street near Ninth Street (no longer extant), both ca. 1857. It was also used for the substantial retaining
wall under the Castle Point Lookout (Photo H-9), sections of which are still visible along Frank Sinatra
Drive (FSD) (Photos 10 and 12; Sullebarger 1991).

Mid-19th Century saw a shift in the activity around the Hoboken waterfront, including the area along
the River Walk. The sections of the walk along the waterfront were widened significantly between ca.
1885 and the 1890s (Photos H-3, H-4, and H-9). With the extension of the Morris and Essex Railroad
(later the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad) to the Hoboken ferry, activity began to shift
to transportation-related uses and industry, rather than pastoral amusement. Beginning in the 1860s
and 1870s, major transatlantic steamship companies built piers on the waterfront including along the
River Walk. By 1882, the Holland America Line joined other steamship companies along the Hoboken
waterfront, and ultimately operated two piers - one at Fifth Street and the other at Sixth Street along
“River Road,” as it was then called (Photo H-11).

The character of River Road changed dramatically with the increased commercial activity (Photo H-3).
By 1884, Elysian Fields was almost totally built over, except for the northern section, now preserved
as “Elysian Park” (Grubb 1996: 6-9; Grubb 2012: 3-20; and see also in Maps: 1881 Bird’s Eye view).
The waters of Sybil’s Cave having been declared unfit to drink, the use of that spot continued as a
tavern, which kept its beer cold in the cave’s spring; the tavern ultimately became a watering hole for
the dockworkers (Photos H-4, H-7, and H-8). The width of River Road was steadily increased by the
addition of fill during the 1880s and 1890s, and the edge of the bank was now armored with rip-rap to
prevent erosion (Photos H-7 and H-8).

By the end of the 19th Century, pedestrian use of River Road was given over to vehicles. Carts and,
later, automobiles could access the waterfront from Fourth and Fifth Streets via a graded entry with a
masonry retaining wall (Sanborn 1891; Hopkins 1909; and in Maps: 1904 Bird’s Eye view) along
River Road, which turned 90 degrees north, and descended down to the waterfront. The incline and
retaining wall at Fifth Street is still extant (Photos 5 and 6). The Hoboken Manufacturers’ Railroad,
also known as the Hoboken Shore Railroad, began its operations in 1897, running 1.5 miles of track
between a junction with the Erie Railroad in Weehawken to the Port of New York Authority pier
southward at First Street (Photo H-11; in Maps: 1904 Bird’s Eye View). It also was associated with a
train yard at Sixth Street, and a car float bridge and the associated Pennsylvania Railroad Marine yard
at Eleventh Street along the Hudson River (Photo H-12 and H-13). This repair yard is now occupied
by Union Dry Dock (Photo 17). Between the marine repair yard at the foot of 10th Street and the
steamship piers at the foot of Sixth Street was the Charles Schulz building supply yard, a coal pier, an
iron works, and Campbell’s 5-story brick warehouse (Brell 1906; Sanborn Maps 1891, 1906; Hoboken
Historical Museum, Photo Collections). By 1909, the Hoboken Shore Railroad ran as many as three
tracks along the base of the bluffs at Castle Point.

The First and Second World Wars took their toll on the Hoboken waterfront, as did the intervening
years of the Great Depression. In 1917, the U. S. Government seized the piers and warehouses of the
German-owned steamship companies along the waterfront, which then were used for shipping soldiers,
supplies, and war materiel to the European front (Grubb 1996: 6-18). After the war, some ten
steamship lines were still based in Hoboken, but with the downturn in the 1930s, there was little
activity (Drobbin 1995). The former tavern and other frame buildings that stood around Sybil’s Cave
were finally demolished in 1937, revealing the long-hidden cave (Grubb 2012: 3-23).

World War II increased the activity on the waterfront, as once again the U.S. Government
commandeered Hoboken’s piers for military shipping activities (Drobbin 1995). A recent engineering
study estimated that improvements were made to the timber supports for River Road and the piers
during this period (Haddon 2012). After the war, life was reportedly filled with corruption and
violence among the longshoremen who worked the docks, as illustrated in a 1948 series of 24 articles
by investigative reporter Malcolm Johnson in the New York Sun. The series, entitled “Crime on the
Waterfront,” won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting in 1949 (later made into the 1954 famous film
On the Waterfront, starring Marlon Brando).

In 1951, the U. S. government finally sold all the piers it had seized in World War I to the City of
Hoboken. By this time, the new importance of air travel and the development of containerized cargo
that required deep-water ports undermined the utility of the Hoboken waterfront. The area continued
its decline into increasing disrepair (Hartman and Lewis 2003).

It was not until the 1970s, when Hoboken “brownstones” became attractive to a new group of urban
homesteaders, did the city’s economic rebirth begin in earnest. The Hoboken Shore Railroad – a
vestige of the former level of activity on the busy waterfront – was finally discontinued in 1977
(Grubb 2012: 3-20).

In 1985, River Road was renamed “Frank Sinatra Drive” after native son Frank Sinatra (b. 1915; d.
1998) (Stevens Institute of Technology 2014). By the 1990s, a major redevelopment and waterfront
renovation at the southern section of the city’s waterfront resulted in the creation of several new
upscale multi-unit residential buildings and a creation of park on Pier A (Hartman and Lewis 2003).

Efforts to redevelop the waterfront for recreational uses gradually moved northward along Frank
Sinatra Drive during the late 1990s. First, a bulkhead was added to shore up the roadway in 1997. In
1998, Frank Sinatra Memorial Park was created along FSD between Fifth and Sixth Streets, complete
with an amphitheater, a soccer field, and a park building for ticket sales and restroom facilities (1998,
Dean Marchetto, AIA, Arch.; Photos 3 and 4).

In 2007, a major exploration and cleaning of Sybil’s Cave was undertaken, which recovered sections
of the original carved 19th Century serpentine rock surround at the cave entrance. At the behest of then
Mayor Dave Roberts, Sybil’s Cave was restored as a cultural site in 2008, encircled with a decorative
metal fence and gate, and the cave opening was marked by a new EIFS 2 surround for the cave
entrance, its design informed by the original 19th C. surround (Photos 13 and 14).

Also in 2008, a new World War II memorial was designed and installed at the corner of Fourth Street
and FSD (2008, Dean Marchetto, AIA, Arch.; Photo 2). A year later, Castle Point Skate Park and the
walkway and fishing pier (Photos 15 and 16) were opened to the public.

The Maxwell House coffee plant at 11th and Hudson Streets - an economic power house in Hoboken
for decades – closed its doors in 1992, having lost out to a sister plant in Jacksonville, Florida, as to
which would stay in business (Nieves 1992). Today, the plant has been redeveloped into a multi-unit
residential complex (Photo 24) and a waterfront esplanade called “Maxwell Place Park.” A new
boathouse informed by folk-vernacular architecture style of the same period as the New York Yacht
Club boathouse that once stood nearby the present site, was constructed near the water’s edge (Photo
23) and is accompanied by an interpretive plaque dedicated to the history of the NYYC.

All has not been completely copacetic for FSD, however, given the poor state of the infrastructure.
Frank Sinatra Memorial Park on FSD between Fifth and Sixth Streets partially collapsed in 2009, as
did a section of the drive itself, due to deteriorating timber pilings installed some 60 years before
(Haddon 2012). Over the course of some 10 years beginning in 1998, various sections of the roadway
either sunk or cracked and became unsafe. It took some four years for the complex repair work to be
completed at Sinatra Park: it was reopened in 2013.

The latest campaign in the revitalizing of the Hoboken Waterfront is the current project, which will
“envision” a pedestrian- and bike-friendly Frank Sinatra Drive that will increase its use as a public
amenity, as well as a thoroughfare. The project will require the cooperation of the several owners of
the parcels along the waterfront, i.e., the City, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Union Dry Dock
(see Hoboken Tax Maps, Sheets 42 and 43).

HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

The following resources are located in or near the Frank Sinatra Drive and should be taken into
account by any project in the area. Adverse effects to these resources should be avoided.

Identified Historic Resources

    The Stevens Historic District, Castle Point between 4th and 11th Streets, Hoboken. SHPO
    Opinion, 2/28/1991 (See Stevens Historic District Map). This National Register-eligible district
    includes the 55-acre campus of Stevens Institute of Technology, as well as the residential blocks of
    Castle Point Terrace and the two blocks on Hudson Street between Elysian Fields Park and 8th
    Street. The district is associated primarily with Stevens Institute, which opened its doors in 1870.
    The boundary of the historic district runs generally along the western boundary of the right-of-way
    for Frank Sinatra Drive at the base of the bluff, although reportedly not including the Sybil’s Cave
    site, which is maintained by the City through an easement granted by Stevens Institute (Photos 8 –
    10).

    Elysian Park, 10th - 11th Streets between Hudson Street and FSD (Photos 15 to 17), which is also
    included within the boundaries of the Stevens Historic District. Originally part of the larger tract
    known as “Elysian Fields,” this greensward was first opened in 1845 by members of the Stevens
    family. It was reported to be on or near the site of the first baseball field.

    Sybil’s Cave, 800 Frank Sinatra Drive. Certification of Eligibility (COE) for the National Register
    of Historic Places, 5/13/2009 (Photos 13 and 14). Sybil’s Cave contained a fresh water spring that
    was opened by the Stevens family in the 1830s as a tourist attraction. A successful tavern was
    eventually created near the opening, which became a regional draw for as many as 20,000 visitors
    on a summer’s day. It was closed to the public in the1800s due to health concerns, and was filled
    in with concrete during the 1930s. In 2008, Hoboken Mayor Dave Roberts restored and
    rededicated the site, installed protective wrought iron fencing and an interpretive plaque.

Previously Unidentified Cultural Resources

    Castle Point Lookout (1857; Photo 10). 100’ promontory (the highest point in Hoboken) on the
    Stevens Institute of Technology campus overlooking the FSD and the waterfront park. Balustrade
    is visible from FSD near the foot of 7th Street. This feature was constructed by the Stevens family
    ca. 1857 as one of the scenic amenities of its estate on Castle Point.

    Unmarked Iron artifact (n. d.; Photo 7), near eastern sidewalk at north end of Sinatra Park
    Soccer Field at 5th Street and FSD (Potential). The source of this item is unknown, although it may
    be over 50 years old. It was likely put in place during the creation of Sinatra Park, or the
    reconstruction of the soccer field. More research is recommended before any disposition of this
    artifact is undertaken.

    Stone Retaining Walls (various dates, locations). Several masonry retaining walls from the 19th
    Century and early 20th Centuries are found along FSD, i.e., at the foot of 5th Street and FSD (pre-
    1891) (Photos 5 and 6); a section of serpentine stone wall below the Castle Point Lookout (1857)
    (Photo 10); and walls that extend from foot of 9th to Elysian Park (sections pre-1904, some pre-

                                                                                Page 16 of 27

    1909, some pre-1923) (Photos 15 and 16). These retaining walls, among other things, mark the
    gradual evolution of the project area from a scenic attraction traversed by pedestrians to a busy
    waterfront, first teeming with wagons, and later traversed by cars and trains.

    Serpentine Rock bluff, Castle Point, along the west side of FSD (historical/geological feature)
    (Photos 8 to 12). While there are other locations known to have this rock formation, including
    some six in New Jersey, the bluff at Castle Point was first identified as a by Hendrik Hudson in his
    ship logs of 1609, and established Castle Point, Hoboken, as a natural landmark. Stone from this
    outcrop was quarried by the Stevens family and used to construct several features on its property,
    of which only the gate at 6th Street remains extant. The green face of this outcrop of serpentine
    remains a striking feature of FSD and should be taken into account as an important element of the
    historical landscape.

Cultural Resources less than 50 Years Old

These resources are constructed within 50 years, some even quite recently, and are included here as
“cultural resources,” i.e., designed features, landscapes, facilities, or artifacts that are meaningful to the
citizens of Hoboken. As these features are less than 50 years old and may have potential as cultural
landmarks, but only if they are found to have "exceptional importance," or if they are integral parts of
districts that are eligible for listing in the National Register, using the evaluation criteria of the
National Register of Historic Places (Sherfy and Luce 1979). To date, this evaluation has not been
undertaken. However, any action that would alter, remove, or relocate these sites should necessitate an
evaluation for any adverse effects on the area.

     Castle Point Skate Park, 1101 FSD (Photo 15). This skateboarding park is maintained by the
     City of Hoboken and is located along the waterfront.

     Frank Sinatra Memorial Park (1998), 4th Street and FSD (Photos 3 and 4). This waterfront park
     was built by the City of Hoboken and consists of a soccer field on pilings in the Hudson River, a
     concrete amphitheater that faces the former site of the World Trade Center, and a small park
     building (1998, Dean Marchetto AIA, Arch.) for ticket sales and restroom facilities (temporarily
     closed due to damage from Super Storm Sandy). The Park was closed in 2009 due to the collapse
     of the timber pilings that supported it. It was reopened in 2013, after new concrete pilings were
     constructed.

     Memorial “We the Surviving Workers,” Union Dry Dock Grounds, FSD between Ninth and
     Tenth Streets (n. d.; Photo 18). Dedicated to the workers of the Hoboken “working waterfront” –
     “shipyard workers, longshoremen, dock buildings, teamsters, tug, barge and ferry boat crews,
     deep water sailors, railroad crews and the support men and women who made the Hoboken
     ‘working waterfront’ and our city of Hoboken” ( presumed to be less than 50 years).

     World War II Memorial, 4th Street at FSD (2008, Dean Marchetto, AIA, Arch.; Photo 2).
     Memorial to the 159 soldiers from Hoboken who died in World War II. The installation is set
     against the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline and features a small park and a bronze statue of
     two soldiers supporting each other. Bronze helmets sit on top of 21 rifles behind the statue.

     Walkway and Fishing Pier, foot of 8th Street and FSD (2009, Dean Marchetto, AIA, Arch.;
     Photo 15). Created ca. 2009 by Mayor Dave Roberts and maintained by the City of Hoboken.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Archaeological Resources

Any proposed plans should be reviewed to ensure that any potential adverse effects to archaeologically
sensitive sites are minimized, mitigated, or avoided. This study has accumulated a great deal of
information on both the history of Hoboken and on previous cultural resources investigations in the
City. Prior to the finalization of any plans that will follow from this “envisioning,” a comprehensive
Phase IA cultural resources study suitable for review by state and federal agencies should be
conducted. Specific construction proposals can then be evaluated for sensitivity to potential
archaeological resources and, if need be, archaeologists can test the areas of potential effect to
determine the presence or absence of these resources.

One type of resource likely to be encountered by construction along FSD includes wharfs, docks, and
piers. The documentary research shows that the project area waterfront was not developed until late in
the 19th Century. The Phase IA cultural resource survey described above will be most useful in dating
and documenting waterfront structures that may be exposed and impacted by the proposed
development, and furthermore, will assist in the development of interpretive signage that will inform
visitors to FSD of the rich history of Hoboken’s waterfront.

Historic Resources

Frank Sinatra Drive is an area that today has retained more historic resources than perhaps any other
location along Hoboken waterfront. The preservation of these historic districts, sites, objects,
structures, and historic natural features found within the project site will enhance the public benefit
and visitor experience in the area.

While this study has outlined the history of the project area, identified historic resources and areas of
archaeological sensitivity and their locations as part of the existing conditions survey, it is premature,
at this point, to provide any recommendations as to specific treatments or proposed plans, as they are
in the process of just now being formulated in consultation with the public and the City.

However, it is important to look forward in the envisioning process to ultimate development of
specific treatment proposals or reconfigurations of the waterfront that may affect historic resources –
input that is not anticipated in the current project. State and federal regulatory reviews regarding
alignments, ground disturbance, coastal construction and construction activities in other
archaeologically sensitive areas, etc. that may potentially affect historic resources, may have a
significant effect on the realization of the plans as envisioned.

With that in mind, the MDKA recommendations for the treatment of historic resources (including
identified cultural resources less than 50 years of age and historic landscape features) include the
following:

    1. Review of specific design proposals by cultural resource specialists. Any proposed plans to
       disturb, alter, demolish, or relocate cultural resources in or adjacent to the project area be
       reviewed by a qualified historic preservation specialist so as to provide its comments and
       recommendations with regard to specific proposed activities that may affect historic or

    archaeological resources. If cultural resources are potentially affected by the proposed design
    or treatments, alternatives should be considered so as to minimize, mitigate, or avoid adverse
    effects;

2. Review by the Hoboken Historic Preservation Commission. After the initial review by a
   cultural resource specialist, proposed plans or concepts should be submitted to the Hoboken
   Historic Preservation Commission for its review and comment. Such reviews are not
   specifically included in this envisioning process, and should be undertaken as the plans
   progress.

3. Regulatory Analysis. Because it is anticipated that certain proposed actions will be undertaken
   by the City, or accomplished using local, county, state, or federal funding, a regulatory
   analysis is recommended so that a comprehensive view of the regulatory requirements that
   might be encountered with regard to cultural resources be understood. Construction activities
   of a roadway along the Hudson River waterfront may also encounter other kinds of reviews,
   including the National Historic Preservation Act §106, the Department of Transportation Act,
   § 4(f), the Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA), the National Environmental Protection
   Act (NEPA), and other county, state, and federal regulations that must be taken into account.

4. Design Consultation. It is recommended that an historic preservation specialist review the
   design, placement, and content of any interpretive materials, such as plaques and historic
   markers, as well as street furniture, fencing, or recommended sites or features to be
   incorporated in the Concept Design Plan.

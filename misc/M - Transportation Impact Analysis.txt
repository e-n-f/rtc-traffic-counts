August 2017




1. INTRODUCTION

This report documents the assumptions, methodologies, and findings of a study conducted by Fehr & Peers
to evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the proposed Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility
project (project or CCTF), at 441 Bauchet Street in the City of Los Angeles. This study was conducted as part
of an environmental impact report (EIR) being prepared for the proposed project.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project is to modernize and replace the existing County’s Men’s Central Jail (also known as
the “MCJ”). The proposed project will be a state-of-the-art correctional facility that provides mental health,
substance use, and medical treatment, educational programs and reentry counseling to reduce recidivism
and to connect inmate-patients with community resources upon their release. The 17.7-acre project site is
owned by the County and is bordered by Bauchet Street to the southeast, Vignes Street to the southwest,
and railroad tracks on the rest of the perimeter, as shown in Figure 1. The project site is occupied by the
existing County MCJ with support facilities and the Central Arraignment Court. Across Bauchet Street from
the project site is the County-owned Twin Towers Correctional Facility (also known as the “TTCF”), which
consists of two jail towers, the Inmate Reception Center and the Correctional Treatment Center.

The County proposes to reuse the existing MCJ site to develop and operate a new, not-to-exceed 3,885-
bed CCTF with other Sheriff and support functions, totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet. The CCTF
would consist of a new correctional treatment facility to provide mental health, substance use disorder,
medical treatment and educational programs for male and female inmate-patients. The new facility would
include an administration and support center, new Arraignment Court, new public plaza, new
loading/kitchen, new central plant, new parking structure, Court Line and bus queuing area, new loop road,
new vehicle driveway to Vignes Street, closure of public traffic on Bauchet Street beyond entry to the new
parking structure, and new bridge or tunnel connection under Bauchet Street to the TTCF. Demolition and
new construction will be phased to minimize impacts to ongoing operations.

The project site is currently developed with 1960s- and 1970s-era jail facilities with a combined building
area of 935,150 square feet and 5,108 beds housing high- and medium-security male inmate-patients. Over
the period from 2012 through 2014, an average of 4,862 beds were occupied at the MCJ each day.

The CCTF project has not yet been designed, but it is anticipated that vehicular access would be taken from
Bauchet Street, similar to what currently exists, but would be supplemented with a driveway on Vignes
Street northeast of Bauchet Street intended to serve only Sheriff’s buses. Two options are analyzed for the
proposed project. Two options for development of the CCTF are analyzed.

Under Option One, the proposed CCTF would be constructed entirely on the site of the existing Men’s
Central Jail on Bauchet Street. To support the continued operation of this facility as construction of the CCTF
occurs, an off-site parking structure would be constructed to provide replacement parking for employees
and visitors. A parking structure with 1,200 to 1,500 spaces is proposed for development on the existing
County-owned Lot 45 in Chinatown, located between North Spring Street and New High Street, north of
Ord Street and south of Alpine Street (Spring Street Parking Structure Site). That lot currently has 255
parking spaces, of which 93 are reserved for County employees and 162 are available for public parking.

Once the CCTF is complete, the parking structure would be available for use by existing and new county
employees. Shuttles will be used to link this parking supply with the Men’s Central Jail during construction
of the CCTF and with other County facilities after construction. The parking lot has not yet been designed,
but is assumed to provide vehicular access on both North Spring Street and New High Street.

Under Option Two, the correctional and treatment facilities of the proposed CCTF as well as a portion of
the supporting parking supply would be constructed entirely on the site of the existing Men’s Central Jail
on Bauchet Street. Under this option, a separate parking structure would be constructed on an adjacent 4-
acre vacant site at 1060 North Vignes Street which is currently vacant (Vignes Lot Parking Structure Site).
The parking structure on the Vignes Lot would provide up to 3,000 parking spaces for use during
construction and operation of the CCTF. This represents approximately two-thirds of the total planned
parking supply for the CCTF project. This analysis assumes that the Vignes Street Lot Parking Structure built
under Option Two would provide vehicular access at the existing signalized intersection of Vignes Street &
Rosabell Street and via the segment of College Street east of Main Street. An active railroad tracks lie
between the Vignes Lot Parking Structure site and the CCTF site. Pedestrian connections would be made
on Vignes Street and through either a bridge over the railroad tracks or a tunnel below the railroad tracks.

STUDY SCOPE

The scope of work for this study, base assumptions and technical methodologies were determined in
consultation with the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works (LADPW), the City of Los Angeles
Department of Transportation (LADOT), and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).

Traffic Scenarios

The study anticipates that the project would be completed by year 2027 and is directed at analyzing the
potential project generated traffic impact on surrounding street system relative to existing and future traffic
conditions. The following traffic scenarios have been developed and analyzed as part of this study:

    •    Existing Conditions – The analysis of existing traffic conditions is intended to provide a basis for the
         remainder of the study. The existing conditions analysis includes a description of the transportation
         system serving the project site, existing traffic volumes, and an assessment of the operating
         conditions at the study analysis locations described below.

    •    Existing plus Project Conditions – This traffic scenario provides projected traffic volumes and an
         assessment of operating conditions under existing conditions with the addition of project-
         generated traffic. The impacts of the proposed project on existing traffic operating conditions were
         then identified.

    •    Future Base (Year 2027) Conditions – Future traffic projections without the proposed project were
         developed. The objective of this analysis was to project future traffic growth and operating
         conditions that could be expected to result from regional growth and related projects in the vicinity
         of the project site in 2027.




                                                                                                               3

         Future (Year 2027) plus Project Conditions – This traffic scenario provides projected traffic volumes
          and an assessment of operating conditions under future conditions with the addition of project-
          generated traffic. The impacts of the proposed project on future traffic operating conditions were
          then identified.

ORGANIZATION OF REPORT

This report is divided into eight chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 describes the existing
conditions including an inventory of the streets, highways, and transit service in the study area, a summary
of existing traffic volumes, and an assessment of existing operating conditions. The methodologies used to

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to develop a detailed description of existing
conditions in the study area. Existing (baseline) conditions for the purpose of this study are those that
prevailed in mid-2015, which is when the Notice of Preparation for the EIR was released. The assessment of
conditions relevant to this study includes a description of the study area, an inventory of the local street
system in the vicinity of the project site, a review of traffic volumes on these facilities, an assessment of the
resulting operating conditions, and the current transit service in the study area. A detailed description of
these elements is presented in this chapter.

STUDY AREA

The project site is in the Central City North Community Plan area of the City of Los Angeles. The study area
selected for analysis extends to N Broadway to the west, Commercial Street/Aliso Street to the south, I-5 to
the east, and College Avenue to the north. All of the streets in the study area are under the jurisdiction of
the City of Los Angeles. Freeways are under the jurisdiction of the California Department of Transportation

PUBLIC TRANSIT SERVICE

Table 1 shows the various local and express bus routes providing service in the study area. Due to its
proximity to Los Angeles Union Station, the project site is very well-served by several local, regional and
national transit lines. The project is located within ¼-mile of the Metro Rapid 770 bus stop at Alameda Street
& Vignes Street and within ½-mile walking distance of the Patsaouras Transit Plaza and Union Station. Bus,
light rail, subway and commuter rail service there is provided by Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (Metro) and other transit providers. Considering the ability of passengers to transfer
between lines and modes, the project site is accessible from most of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
Table 1 summarizes the bus transit service at the intersections closest to the project site.

EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND LEVEL OF SERVICE

This section presents existing base peak hour traffic volumes, describes the methodology used to assess
the traffic conditions at each intersection, and analyzes the resulting operating conditions at each, indicating
volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios and levels of service (LOS).

Existing Base Traffic Volumes

New weekday AM and PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected at the study intersections in
May and November 2015. The existing weekday morning and afternoon peak hour volumes at the study
intersections are provided in Figure 2. Count sheets for these intersections and street segments are
contained in Appendix A.

Level of Service Methodology

As required by LADOT and as permitted by the Los Angeles County Traffic Impact Analysis Report Guidelines
(LACDPW, 1997), the Critical Movement Analysis (CMA) method was used to determine the LOS grade for
signalized intersections (Transportation Research Board, 1980). The CMA methodology determines the
intersection volume to capacity (V/C) ratio. The V/C ratio is then used to determine the corresponding LOS
grade. Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to describe the condition of traffic flow, ranging
from excellent conditions at LOS A to overloaded conditions at LOS F. The City of Los Angeles typically uses
LOS D as a standard, meaning that LOS D or better is considered to represent satisfactory conditions, while
LOS E or F is generally considered to be substandard. Table 2 provides level of service definitions for
signalized intersections per LADOT traffic study guidelines.

The City of Los Angeles’ Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system is a computer-based
traffic signal control system that monitors traffic conditions and system performance to allow ATSAC
operations to manage signal timing to improve traffic flow conditions. The Adaptive Traffic Control System
(ATCS) is an enhancement to ATSAC and provides fully traffic-adaptive signal control based on real-time
traffic conditions. All of the 17 study intersections are in the City of Los Angeles and are currently operating
under the City’s ATSAC and ATCS systems and, in accordance with LADOT’s procedures, a credit of 0.100
V/C reduction was applied at the study intersections to reflect the benefits of ATSAC (0.070) and ATCS
(0.030).

Existing Levels of Service

The existing weekday AM and PM peak hour turning movements shown in Figure 2 were used in conjunction
with the level of service methodology described above to determine existing operating conditions at each
of the study intersections. Level of service calculation worksheets are provided in Appendix B.

Table 3 summarizes the existing AM and PM peak hour V/C ratios and corresponding levels of service at
each of the study intersections. As shown, all but one of the 17 study intersections currently operates at fair
to good levels of service (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours. In the AM peak hour,
Mission Road & Cesar E. Chavez Avenue (Intersection 7) operates at LOS E.

EXISTING BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES

Bicycle Facilities

The following streets are designated bicycle routes (Class III bikeways), with or without sharrows, in the
project area:

        1st Street from San Pedro Street to Boyle Avenue
        2nd Street from Main Street to Santa Fe Street
        State Street south of Cesar E. Chavez Avenue

Class II bike lanes currently exist on the following streets in the study area:

        1st Street west of San Pedro Street and east of Boyle Avenue
        Spring Street south of Cesar E. Chavez Avenue
        Main Street south of Cesar E. Chavez Avenue
        3rd Street from San Pedro Street to Santa Fe Street
        Mission Road north of Cesar E. Chavez Avenue

Pedestrian Facilities

Downtown Los Angeles has a mature network of pedestrian facilities including sidewalks, crosswalks and
pedestrian safety features. Approximately 8- to 12-foot sidewalks are generally provided. However, near the
project site, the sidewalk along both sides of Vignes Street narrows to three feet below the bridge east of
Bauchet Street that carries the mainline railroad tracks. Just beyond the bridge, the sidewalk widens to five
feet on either side of Vignes.

3. TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

PROJECT TRAFFIC

The development of trip generation estimates for the proposed project involves the use of a 3-step process
similar to that discussed for the cumulative projects: trip generation, trip distribution, and traffic assignment.
Project Trip Generation

As discussed in Chapter 1, the proposed project consists of a replacement of the existing Men’s Central Jail
on the current site. Trip generation for the CCTF was estimated on the basis of existing and projected
staffing levels for each hour in the AM and PM peak periods, as defined by LADOT, and over the course of
a typical weekday. Trip rates in the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers,
2012) were reviewed but found not to reflect the off-peak and nuanced characteristics of this facility. To
capture these intricacies, we developed a trip generation model and calibrated it to existing driveway counts
at the Men’s Central Jail.

Trip generation at the project site is comprised of employee trips, Sheriff’s bus trips, delivery trucks and
visitors. County staff advised that the proposed project would slightly increase employee trips, as staffing
would be increased by approximately 1% to provide a higher level of services per inmate-patient in the
proposed CCTF. This analysis conservatively assumes that the number and scheduling of Sheriff’s buses,
deliveries, and visitors would not change from what currently exists. Thus the trip generation model has
three inputs:

1.       Employee schedules

2.       Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR)

3.       Arrival/Departure spread

The first two inputs were provided by County staff. Staff schedules for Men’s Central Jail, Twin Towers
Correctional Facility, the Inmate Reception Center, Court Services Transportation buses, Court Services
Transportation mechanics, Department of Public Health, the Arraignment Court, Sherriff’s Buses, and
Visitors were received, and the number of each type of staff per shift. Based on relevant reports filed with
the South Coast Air Quality Management District under Rule 2202, the actual AVR for Men’s Central Jail
staff is 1.21 persons per vehicle and Twin Towers Correctional Facility staff is 1.58 persons per vehicle.

The third variable was estimated based on existing driveway counts. Arrivals and departures were split into
early and on time. The model was calibrated so that 40% of arrivals were early (arriving 30 to 60 minutes
before their scheduled start times) and 40% of departures were late (departing 30 to 60 minutes after their
scheduled shift end times). The remaining 60% of arrivals and departures were assumed to be on time
(within 30 minutes of their scheduled start or end times). The model is able to closely match existing
driveway counts. While this model is able to represent observed traffic counts, it does not match perfectly
due to normal daily variation due to non-scheduled activity (sick days, vacation, meetings, etc.). To make
the analysis as precise as possible, the intersection turning movement counts at Bauchet Street & Vignes
Street were used to establish the baseline level of activity during the analyzed peak hours and the proposed



                                                                                                               13
Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility Transportation Impact Analysis

changes in staffing were input to the model to estimate the change in trip generation that would occur
upon completion of the proposed project.

Using the trip generation model, the daily, AM peak hour, and PM peak hour trip generation for the project
was estimated as shown in Table 4. The project is estimated to generate an increase of 242 daily trips,
including an estimated increase of 9 inbound and 0 outbound trips in the highest one hour in the AM peak
period, and an estimated increase of 29 inbound and 0 outbound trips in the highest one hour in the PM
peak period. Due to the timing of existing and planned shift changes, the traffic growth during the AM and
PM peak hour is limited to only the outbound direction; no changes are projected in the inbound direction
during either peak hour. Appendix C provides data on the projected staffing changes, the relevant shift
times, and an hourly estimate of existing and future trip generation over the course of a typical weekday.

Project Traffic Distribution and Project Trip Assignment
The geographic distribution of trips generated by the proposed project is dependent on characteristics of
the street system serving the project site; the level of accessibility of routes to and from the proposed
project site; and residential areas from which the employees would be drawn. A trip distribution pattern was
developed for the project based on two sources. Home zip code data of existing employees at the MCJ and
adjacent correctional facilities was supplied by Los Angeles County staff and then mapped. Taken together,
this data was distributed approximately 15% to/from the north, 45% to/from the east, 35% to/from the
south and 5% to/from the west. Consideration was the given to the location of the project site in the context
of the surrounding local arterial streets and access to the regional freeway system, a trip distribution pattern
was developed for project trips, as illustrated in Figure 3.

An element of the proposed project common to both Option 1 and Option 2 is the construction of a new
driveway, to be used only by Sheriff’s buses, on Vignes Street between Bauchet Street and the Vignes Street
Grade Separation. Because it is not yet known if a signal will be approved by LADOT at this location, this
analysis assumes that it would be unsignalized and that left-turns out would not be permitted. Thus, buses
that currently turn left upon exiting Bauchet Street were unassigned from that intersection and shifted to
make right turns out of the proposed driveway and travel west toward Alameda Street or beyond to reach
other correctional facilities and courthouses. Buses making other turning movements into and out of the
site were assumed to shift to use the proposed second driveway.

Using the estimated trip generation and the distribution patterns discussed above, the net new traffic
generated by the proposed project was assigned to the street network. Figure 4A shows the assignment of
net new trips associated with the proposed project (Option 1) at the analyzed intersections during the AM
and PM peak hours. The assignment of traffic volumes for Option 1 assumed that all site-generated trips
except for most Sheriff’s buses would access the project site from Bauchet Street.

Under Option 2, a portion of the total estimated future project traffic was assumed to shift in proportion to
the allocation of total future parking for the project. The parking structure built on the Vignes Street site
under Option 2 would provide up to approximately 3,000 parking spaces, and up to approximately 1,500
parking spaces would be located adjacent to the CCTF itself Bauchet Street. Thus, two-thirds of the existing
and future trips related to the CCTF and other correctional facilities on Bauchet Street were reassigned to
the Vignes Lot Parking Structure site. Figure 4B shows the assignment of net new trips associated with the
proposed project (Option 2) at the analyzed intersections during the AM and PM peak hours.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

The estimated changes in project traffic under Option 1 and Option 2 were assigned to the study
intersections and added to the existing traffic volumes to estimate existing plus project traffic volumes.
Turning movement traffic volumes for the existing plus project scenarios are provided in Figure 5A (Option
1) and Figure 5B (Option 2).

FUTURE YEAR 2027 TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

To evaluate the potential impacts of the proposed project on future (Year 2027) conditions, it was necessary
to develop estimates of future traffic conditions in the area both without and with project traffic. First,
estimates of traffic growth were developed for the study area to forecast future conditions without the
project. These forecasts included traffic increases as a result of both regional ambient traffic growth and
traffic generated by specific developments in the vicinity of the project (related projects). These projected
traffic volumes, identified herein as the cumulative base conditions, represent the future conditions without
the proposed project. The traffic generated by the proposed project was then estimated and assigned to
the surrounding street system. Project traffic was added to the future base to form future plus project traffic
conditions, which were analyzed to determine the incremental traffic impacts attributable to the project
itself.

The assumptions and analysis methodology used to develop each of the future year scenarios discussed
above are described in more detail in the following sections.

FUTURE YEAR 2027 BASE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

The traffic volumes projected for the future base scenario (Year 2027) take into account the expected
changes in traffic over existing conditions from two primary sources: ambient growth in the existing traffic
volumes due to the effects of overall regional growth and development outside the study area, and traffic
generated by specific development projects in, or in the vicinity of, the study area. The methods used to
account for these factors are described below.

Background or Ambient Growth

Based on historic trends and with the concurrence of LADOT, it was established that an ambient growth
factor of 1% per year should be applied to adjust the existing base year traffic volumes to reflect the effects
of regional growth and development by year 2027. This adjustment was applied to the existing (year 2015)
traffic volume data to reflect the effect of ambient growth by the year 2027.

Cumulative Project Traffic Generation and Assignment

Future base traffic forecasts include the effects of known specific projects, called related projects, expected
to be implemented in the vicinity of the proposed project site prior to the buildout date of the proposed
project. The list of related projects was prepared based on data from LADOT at the time of the Notice of
Preparation. A total of 65 cumulative projects were identified within approximately two miles of the project
site. These projects are listed in Table 5 and illustrated in Figure 6.

Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility Transportation Impact Analysis
August 2017




Trip Generation

Trip generation estimates for the related projects was either provided by LADOT or was obtained from
previous studies and available environmental documentation. Table 5 presents the resulting trip generation
estimates for these related projects. These projections are conservative in that they do not in every case
account for either the existing uses to be removed or the possible use of non-motorized travel modes
(transit, walking, etc.).

Trip Distribution

The geographic distribution of the traffic generated by the related projects is dependent on several factors.
These factors include the type and density of the proposed land uses, the geographic distribution of
population from which employees and potential patrons of proposed commercial developments may be
drawn, the locations of employment and commercial centers to which residents of residential projects may
be drawn, and the location of the projects in relation to the surrounding street system. If the traffic study
or environmental document for a related project was available, the trip distribution for that study was used.

Traffic Assignment

Using the estimated trip generation and trip distribution patterns described above, traffic generated by the
related projects was assigned to the street network.

Transportation Infrastructure Projects

A bicycle lane on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue between Mission Road and Figueroa Street is currently in
development by LADOT. In addition, the City’s 2010 Bicycle Plan includes bicycle lanes on Cesar E. Chavez
east of Mission Road, on North Main Street and North Spring Street through the study area, and on Alameda
Street from Cesar E. Chavez Avenue to North Spring Street.

A mitigation measure for the University of Southern California Health Sciences Campus project was
completed after the baseline traffic counts were collected, which widened the southbound off-ramp from
I-5 to Mission Road to add a third lane. This is reflected in the analysis of future conditions.

Future Year 2027 Base Traffic Volumes

Future year 2027 base weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the analyzed intersections are
provided in Figure 7. The future base traffic conditions represent an estimate of future conditions without
the proposed project.

FUTURE YEAR 2027 PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

The estimated net change in project-generated traffic volumes shown in Figure 4A was added to the
projected 2027 future base traffic volumes shown in Figure 7 to develop the future plus project (Option 1)
AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes shown in Figure 8A. The estimated net change in project-generated
traffic volumes shown in Figure 4B was added to the projected 2027 future base traffic volumes shown in
Figure 7 to develop the future plus project (Option 2) AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes shown in Figure
8B. These scenarios represent future traffic conditions following completion of the proposed project under
Option 1 and Option 2.

4. INTERSECTION TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

The traffic impact analysis evaluates the projected LOS at each study intersection under the existing plus
project and future year 2027 plus project conditions to estimate the incremental increase in the V/C ratio
caused by the proposed project. This provides the information needed to assess the potential impact of the
Project using significance criteria established by LADOT.

CRITERIA FOR DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC IMPACT

LADOT has established threshold criteria to determine significant traffic impact of a proposed project in its
jurisdiction. Under the LADOT guidelines, an intersection would be significantly impacted with an increase
in V/C ratio equal to or greater than 0.04 for intersections operating at LOS C, equal to or greater than 0.02
for intersections operating at LOS D, and equal to or greater than 0.01 for

equal to or greater than 0.02 for intersections operating at LOS D, and equal to or greater than 0.01 for
intersections operating at LOS E or F after the addition of project traffic. Intersections operating at LOS A
or B after the addition of the project traffic are not considered significantly impacted regardless of the
increase in V/C ratio. The following summarizes the impact criteria:


                      Final LOS       Final V/C Ratio       Project-Related Increase in V/C

                          C           > 0.700 - 0.800        equal to or greater than 0.040

                          D           > 0.800 - 0.900        equal to or greater than 0.020

                        E or F            > 0.900            equal to or greater than 0.010

The thresholds of significance used by the County of Los Angeles are similar, but instead of considering the
final (“with project”) LOS when reviewing the difference in V/C ratio, it is the pre-project LOS that is
considered.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT IMPACT ANALYSIS

Existing plus Project Traffic Level of Service

The Existing plus Project traffic volumes presented in Figures 7A and 7B were analyzed to determine the
projected V/C ratios and LOS for each of the analyzed intersections under both Scenario 1 and 2. Table 6
summarizes the results of this analysis and analysis sheets are provided in Appendix B. As indicated in Table
6, all but one of the 17 signalized intersections are projected to operate at LOS D or better during both
peak hours. The exception is Mission Road & Cesar E. Chavez Avenue (Intersection 7), which is projected to
continue operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour.

Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility Transportation Impact Analysis
August 2017




Existing plus Project Intersection Impacts

As shown in Table 6, after applying the significant impact criteria used by both the City and County of Los
Angeles, it is determined that the proposed project would not result in significant traffic impacts under
Existing plus project conditions.

FUTURE YEAR 2027 PLUS PROJECT IMPACT ANALYSIS

Future Base and Plus Project (Year 2027) Traffic Conditions

The year 2027 future base peak hour traffic volumes shown in Figure7 were analyzed to determine the
projected V/C ratio and LOS for each of the analyzed intersections. Table 7 summarizes the projected future
LOS. As seen in the table, all but five of the 17 analyzed intersections are projected to operate at LOS D or
better during both the morning and afternoon peak hours under Future Base conditions. The following
intersections are projected to operate at LOS E or worse during one or both of the peak hours:

5.       Alameda Street & Cesar E. Chavez Avenue (AM and PM peak hours)
6.       Vignes Street & Cesar E. Chavez Avenue (PM peak hour)
7.       Mission Road & Cesar E. Chavez Avenue (AM and PM peak hours)
11.      Alameda Street & Arcadia Street (PM peak hour)
12.      Alameda Street & Aliso Street/Commercial Street (PM peak hour)

The changes in traffic projected to result from the proposed project (Option 1) would not change the future
levels of conditions in the study area.
One additional intersection is projected to operate at LOS E under Future with Project (Option 2) conditions.

2.       Main Street & Alpine Street/Vignes Street (PM peak hour)

Future plus Project Intersection Impacts

As shown in Table 7, applying the criteria for determination of significant impacts used by both the County
of Los Angeles and by LADOT, the proposed project would not result in significant traffic impacts under
Future plus Project (Option 1) conditions. Under Future plus Project (Option 2) conditions, the project would
result in a significant traffic impact at one study intersection in the PM peak:

2.       Main Street & Vignes Street/Alpine Street

POTENTIAL MITIGATION MEASURES

Physical Improvement

Main Street & Vignes Street/Alpine Street (Study Intersection 2)

The intersection of Main Street & Vignes Street/Alpine Street was found to be significantly impacted in the
PM peak hour under Future plus Project (Option 2) conditions. A mitigation measure is proposed that would
widen the westbound approach of Vignes Street to provide a separate right-turn lane. This widening could
occur within the existing right-of-way at the intersection where Alhambra Avenue joins Vignes Street, which
would provide a turn lane approximately 120 feet long. LADOT may require right-of-way dedication from
the Vignes Parking Structure Lot to extend this lane. The appropriate length of this widening would be
determined in consultation with LADOT. Widening the westbound approach would entail some combination
of new striping, signage, signal poles, mast arms, signal controllers, detectors, and/or signal heads. In
addition, the existing sidewalk at this location would need to be replaced and potentially widened.

Implementation of this improvement would fully mitigate the identified impact under Future with Project
(Option 2) conditions, resulting in a V/C ratio of 0.492 (LOS A) in the AM peak hour and a V/C ratio of 0.772
(LOS C) in the PM peak hour.

Transportation Demand Management

The existing Men’s Central Jail, as at other large employment sites, maintains a program of monitoring and
incentives to reduce single-occupant vehicle commute trips. Collectively, known as Travel Demand
Management (or TDM), these programs aim to reduce traffic congestion and the impacts associated with
heavy traffic by providing incentives and other measures to encourage alternative travel arrangements
between work and home. As discussed in Chapter 3, the average vehicle ridership is 1.21 persons per vehicle.
Among the measures now in place at MCJ are:

    •    Transit information center

    •    Rideshare matching services

    •    Guaranteed ride home/Guaranteed return trip

    •    Commuter choice program

    •    Quarterly newsletters, flyers or announcements to employees

    •    New hire orientation and periodic events

    •    Compressed work week and flex time schedules




                                                                                                          32
Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility Transportation Impact Analysis

        Off-peak rideshare program

        Bicycle racks, lockers and showers

Expanding the current menu of incentives and disincentives could reduce vehicle trips during the peak hours
and thus reduce the severity of the impacts identified at two study intersections. The County-owned
correctional facility is somewhat different from many other land uses in that it operates on a 24-hour
schedule and employees have shifts that begin and end throughout the day, including many outside of the
typical peak periods when transit service is most extensive. Because the effectiveness of these measures
cannot be guaranteed, however, those impacts would remain significant and unavoidable. Among the
additional TDM measures that could be considered for implementation following completion of the
proposed CCTF are:

        Direct financial awards for ridesharing

        Preferential parking for those who rideshare

        Parking pricing

        Parking cash-out

        Transit pass subsidy

        Vanpool program

        Review the existing pedestrian pathways between the CCTF site and the Patsaouras Transit Plaza
         for way to enhance their safety or convenience

        Continue the temporary construction-period shuttle between the CCTF site and the selected off-
         site parking site(s) that is operated under Option 1 into the operational period, and alter the route
         to better connect it with the Patsaouras Transit Plaza

5. REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS

This section presents an analysis of potential impacts on the regional transportation system. This analysis
was conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in Congestion Management Program for Los
Angeles County (CMP) (Metro, 2010). The CMP requires that, when an environmental impact report is
prepared for a project, traffic and transit impact analyses be conducted for select regional facilities based
on the quantity of project traffic expected to use those facilities.

REGIONAL TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

The CMP guidelines require that the first issue to be addressed is the determination of the geographic
scope of the study area. The criteria for determining the study area for CMP arterial monitoring intersections
and for freeway monitoring locations are:

        All CMP arterial monitoring intersections where the proposed project will add 50 or more trips during
         either the AM or PM peak hours of adjacent street traffic.

        All CMP mainline freeway monitoring locations where the proposed project will add 150 or more trips,
         in either direction, during either the AM or PM peak hours.

SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC IMPACT CRITERIA

The CMP traffic impact analysis guidelines establish that a significant project impact occurs when a certain
threshold is exceeded. If the proposed project increases traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of capacity
(V/C  0.02), causing LOS F (V/C > 1.00), a significant impact would occur. If the facility is already at LOS F,
a significant impact occurs when the proposed project increases traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of
capacity (V/C  0.02).

Arterial Monitoring Stations

The CMP arterial monitoring station closest to the proposed project site is at Alameda Street & Washington
Boulevard located approximately three miles south of the project site. Based on the project trip distribution
and trip generation, the project is expected to add fewer than 50 peak hour through this CMP arterial
monitoring station; and therefore, no further CMP arterial analysis is required.

Freeway Monitoring Stations

Regional access to the project site is provided by US-101 approximately one-half mile to the south, I-5
approximately 1.5 miles to the east, and SR-110 approximately one mile to the north and west. The CMP
freeway monitoring stations closest to the project site on US-101 is north of Vignes Street, on I-5 is at
Stadium Way and on I-10 at the eastern City of Los Angeles limits. Based on the project trip generation
estimates presented in Chapter 3, the change in staffing associated with the proposed project would add
29 or fewer 1-way trips in either analyzed peak hour.




                                                                                                             34
Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility Transportation Impact Analysis
August 2017




Since fewer than 150 trips would be added during the AM or PM peak hours in either direction at any of
the freeway segments in the vicinity of the study area, no further analysis of the freeway segments is
required for CMP purposes.

REGIONAL TRANSIT IMPACT ANALYSIS

Potential increases in transit person trips generated by the proposed project were estimated using the
methodology outlined in Appendix D of the 2010 CMP, which recommends estimating the number of transit
trips expected to result from a proposed project based on the projected number of vehicle trips and an
average vehicle ridership (AVR), and then provides guidance regarding the percentage of person trips
assigned to public transit depending on the land use type and the proximity to transit services.

The proposed Project would have a net estimated increase in vehicle trip generation of approximately 9
outbound net vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 29 during the PM peak hour. Applying the actual
AVR factor of 1.21 to the estimated vehicle trips would result in an estimated increase of approximately 11
and 35 person trips during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The CMP provides that, of the total net
person trips of a non-residential, non-commercial project, 3.5% of total person trips generated may be
assigned as transit riders for a project such as the CCTF.

Following this approach, the project would generate an estimated increase of one transit trips during the
AM and PM peak hours. Given the number and frequency of transit lines in close proximity to the project
site, this modest level of increase in transit ridership would not be considered to be a significant impact.

CALCULATION OF VEHICLE MILES OF TRAVEL

The estimation of project-related change in annual vehicles miles of travel (VMT) used the trip generation
and distribution estimates presented in Chapter 3. In addition to the trip generation and distribution
estimates, a number of assumptions regarding travel and trip making characteristics such as trip lengths,
days of travel, and other trips generated by the Men’s Central Jail and adjacent correctional facilities were
made.

The technical methodology was developed in order to conduct an extensive and thorough VMT. The
assumptions listed below and shown in Table 8 were used to analyze travel behavior patterns and their
relationship with the existing transportation network:

    •    Distribution estimates for the employees are based on the zip code data for current employees at the
         Men’s Central Jail and the adjacent correctional facilities on Bauchet Street.

    •    Assume that the weekend staffing levels at the proposed CCTF will be the same as the weekday
         staffing levels. Based on information from County staff, staffing levels at the existing MCJ and adjacent
         correctional facilities will increase by approximately 1%, from 5,729 current employees to 5,779 CCTF
         employees upon completion.

        Existing average vehicle ridership is 1.21 for MCJ employees and 1.58 for employees at the adjacent
         correctional facilities. The average 1-way trip length is 28 miles, based on the regional and local
         roadway network from the originating zip codes to the project site. It is assumed that these conditions
         will not change following completion of the project.

        It is conservatively assumed that the number of weekly visitors will remain unchanged following
         completion of the project. The average vehicle ridership for visitors is assumed to be 1.5 and the
         average 1-way trip length is assumed to be 25 miles.

        Information from County staff is that approximately six deliveries occur each day at the MCJ. It is
         assumed that the average 1-way trip length is 25 miles. It is conservatively assumed that the number
         of deliveries will not change following completion of the project.

        It is conservatively assumed that the number of daily Sheriff’s buses will remain unchanged following
         completion of the project. Data on actual VMT for Sheriff’s buses based at the project site for the
         years 2011 to 2014 averaged approximately 2.4 million miles. On average, bus trip length is
         approximately 25 miles.

Based on these assumptions, the total existing annual VMT of the MCJ and adjacent correctional facilities is
estimated to be approximately 105.6 million miles. Following completion of the proposed CCTF project, the
annual VMT is estimated to increase to approximately 108.1 million miles, an increase of approximately
2.3%.

FREEWAY MAINLINE ANALYSIS AND RAMP QUEUING ANALYSIS

As part of the Transportation Impact Analysis, nearby freeway mainline segments on US-101 and nearby
off-ramps were also conducted.

Freeway Mainline Analysis

Freeway mainline segment analysis was conducted using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) operational
analysis methodology, as required by Caltrans. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS) software package was
used to conduct the analysis for the following four segments:

        Northbound US-101 between Broadway and Spring Street

        Southbound US-101 between Broadway and Spring Street

        Northbound US-101 between Alameda Street and Vignes Street

        Southbound US-101 between Los Angeles Street and Garey Street




                                                                                                             37
Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility Transportation Impact Analysis
August 2017




The analysis was conducted in accordance with methodologies outlined in the Caltrans Guide for the
Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (TIS Guide).

Baseline freeway mainline volume and speed data was obtained from Caltrans’ Performance Measurement
System (PeMS) archived traffic data for the AM and PM peak periods for Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and
Thursdays in February and March of 2016 and the data was averaged across the days.

Level of service was determined using the following definitions from the Caltrans TIS Guide (note that LOS
F is defined as average speed below 52.2 miles per hour and density exceeding 45 passenger cars per mile
per lane):

                 LOS DEFINITIONS FOR BASIC FREEWAY SEGMENTS @ 65 MILES/HOUR

                              Level of       Maximum Density           Minimum Speed
                              Service           (pc/mi/ln)                 (mph)
                                 A                    11                      65.0
                                 B                    18                      65.0
                                 C                    26                      64.6
                                 D                    35                      59.7
                                 E                    45                      52.2

LOS results for the four study segments are shown in Table 9A and 9B. Existing levels of service are based
on observed speed at each location; where that speed is below 52.2 mph, LOS F is reported. Under Existing
conditions, two of the segments operate at congested LOS F in the AM peak and all segments operate at
congested LOS F in the PM peak. Under cumulative conditions without the project, the US-101 southbound
segment between Broadway and Spring Street is projected to decline from LOS C to LOS D in the AM peak
hour. In the AM peak hour, two segments are projected to continue operating at LOS F, and four segments
are projected to continue operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour. The proposed project (Option 1 or Option
2) would add 21 or fewer vehicles in any peak hour on any of the analyzed segments, resulting in a change
of 0.4 percent or less. Because these changes in volume are less than 50 vehicles at any location in either of

Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility Transportation Impact Analysis
August 2017




Ramp Delay and Queuing Analysis

A LOS and freeway ramp queuing analysis was conducted at eight freeway ramp locations to determine
future LOS and queuing conditions at the off-ramps as a result of traffic from the proposed project. Level
of service calculations and queue lengths were estimated using the Synchro traffic analysis software
package. Each intersection was configured according to its existing signal timing and physical geometry.

The focus of the queuing analysis is to specifically determine if there is adequate storage capacity at the
off-ramps. An impact is considered significant if the off-ramp queue extends beyond the length of the ramp
itself onto the mainline of the freeway during the peak arrival period and the project contributes to such an
exceedance. The LOS and queuing analysis was conducted for the following intersections and respective
off-ramps:

        I-5/I-10 Southbound Ramps & Mission Road
        I-5 Northbound Ramps & Cesar E. Chavez Avenue
        Vignes Street & Ramirez Street/Patsaouras Transit Plaza
        US-101 Northbound Ramp/Arcadia Street & Alameda Street
        US-101/I-10 Eastbound Ramps & Commercial Street
        US-101 Northbound Ramps & Mission Road
        US-101 Southbound Ramps & Mission Road
        US-101 Southbound Ramps & North Broadway

Tables 10A and 10B present a summary of existing LOS without and with the project (Option 1 and Option
2) using HCM methodology. This methodology is different than the volume to capacity method in previous
chapters because the HCM methodology uses delay as the measure of LOS. Tables 11A and 11B present a
summary of future year LOS conditions without and with the project (Options 1 and Option 2). Under the
HCM methodology four of the ramp intersections are shown to operate at LOS C or better with the project
during both peak hours for all scenarios of the project. Four intersections are projected to operate at LOS
D under Cumulative and Cumulative plus Project conditions, in both Option 1 and Option 2: I-5/I-10
Southbound Ramps & Mission Road in the AM peak hour, I-5 Northbound Ramps & Cesar E. Chavez Avenue
in the AM peak hour, US-101 Northbound Ramp/Arcadia Street & Alameda Street in the PM peak hour, and
US-101/I-10 Eastbound Ramps & Commercial Street in the PM peak hour. At all of the locations projected
to operate at LOS D, the project would not affect the level of delay per vehicle.

Because four of the analyzed ramp terminal intersections are operating at LOS C or better under existing
and cumulative with project conditions, and at the four locations projected to operate at LOS D the project
would not increase vehicle delay, the proposed project is determined to result in less than significant
impacts to the analyzed ramp terminal intersections. Detailed LOS calculations are provided in Appendix B.

Tables 12A and 12B present a summary of the ramp queuing analysis for all project scenarios. The 95 th
percentile queues were reported for the purposes of this analysis. The freeway ramp queues would not
extend beyond the storage length under any existing or cumulative scenarios with the project, therefore
impacts would be less than significant. Detailed queue calculations are provided in Appendix B.

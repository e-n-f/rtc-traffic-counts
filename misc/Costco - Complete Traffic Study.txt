APPENDIX 1 LEVEL-OF-SERVICE CONCEPT
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from "A" to "F".1


Signalized Intersections
The six level-of-service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table B1.
Additionally, Table B2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per
vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service "D" is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.


Table B-1 Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

   Level of
   Service                                                          Average Delay per Vehicle
                    Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely
                    favorable, and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths
       A            may also contribute to low delay.

                    Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This
                    generally occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A,
       B            causing higher levels of average delay.

                    Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle.
                    These higher delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may
                    begin to appear at this level. The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass
       C            through the intersection without stopping.

                    Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The
                    influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of
                    unfavorable progression, long cycle length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion
       D            of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.

                    Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This
                    is usually considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate
                    poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent
       E            occurrences.

                    Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers.
                    This condition often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with
                    many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay
       F            values.

Unsignalized Intersections
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled
(AWSC) intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating
control delay at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service
levels associated with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B3. A quantitative definition of
level of service for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B4. Using this definition, Level of
Service "E" is generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is
that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on
the minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying
acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the
HCM level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

Appendix 6 Costco Trip Generation
       Comparison to ITE and Data
Costco Trip Generation Rate Compared to ITE Rate
The proposed Costco warehouse and fuel station trip generation rate, based on Costco data, was
compared to the ITE rate for comparable uses. The Costco rate includes internalization between the
warehouse and fuel station. An internalization rate of 11% was applied to the ITE trip rates for a
discount club and gasoline service station, based on ITE's methodology for internalization between
mixed-use developments. The trip rates are compared in Table 6-1, below.

The results shown In Table 6-1 illustrate that the proposed Costco rate results in 75 more trips than the
ITE rate.

Walla Walla Senior Housing                                                            March 2010



                                 Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the Traffic Impact Study through a set of
frequently asked questions (FAQs).


Where is the project located?
The project site is located in Walla Walla along the south side of S 9th Avenue (SR 125) and
north of Village Way. Access to the proposed project would be provided via Fairway Drive
and an easement through the parking lot of the Plaza Shopping Center to Plaza Way located
east of the project site.


What is the project land use and trip generation?
The project includes the construction of 120 multi-family senior housing units. These
apartment units would be available exclusively to renters over the age of 62 years and would
not provide any assisted care amenities. The project would generate an average of 418
weekday trips with 16 trips occuring durring the weekday AM peak hour and 19 trips occuring
during the PM peak hour.


What are the existing and future without-project conditions in
the study area?
All intersections and minor street approaches operate at LOS D or better under both existing
and future without-project conditions. All study intersections meet the City of Walla Walla's
LOS D standard.


Would the project have any traffic impacts?
All intersections and minor street approaches and driveways would continue to operate at the
same LOS value under both future without-project and with-project conditions. The average
delay for signalized intersections or the critical movement at stop-controlled intersections
would increase by 1.0 seconds or less. All study intersections would continue to meet the City
of Walla Walla's LOS D standard.


What mitigation measures are recommended?
Based on anticipated operating conditions, no specific off-site mitigation would be required to
serve the increase in project-related travel.


How would the site access operate?
Traffic operations at the two intersections that provide access to the site (Plaza Way
Shopping Center Driveway/Plaza Way and Village Way/Plaza Way) would operate
acceptably at LOS C or better. However, should congestion occasionally occur at the Plaza
Way Shopping Center Driveway/Plaza Way, vehicles egressing from the project site would be
able to recirculate through the shopping center parking lot to egress via the western leg of the
signalized Tietan Street/Plaza Way intersection.

                                   Introduction
This report summarizes the results of the traffic impact analysis (TIA) prepared for the
proposed Walla Walla Senior Housing project located in Walla Walla, Washington. The
purpose of the analysis was to identify potential transportation related impacts associated
with the proposed project and, where necessary, identify measures to mitigate project
impacts. This analysis follows the requirements set forth in the Walla Walla Urban Area
Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) Guidelines and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).


Project Description
The proposed project is located in the City of Walla Walla and includes the construction of
120 multi-family senior housing units. These apartment units would be available exclusively
to renters over the age of 62 years and would not provide any assisted care amenities. The
project site is located along the south side of 9th Avenue (SR 125) and north of Village Way
as shown in Figure 1 and is currently vacant. Access to the proposed project would be
provided via Fairway Drive and an easement through the parking lot of the Plaza Shopping
Center to Plaza Way located east of the project site. The project would be constructed by the
end of 2012. A preliminary site plan is shown in Figure 2.


Study Area
The study area was defined through coordination with City of Walla Walla staff and consists
of four intersections and the site access driveway provided through an easement through the
Plaza Shopping Center. The four off-site study intersections and site access driveway are
listed below.

         Dalles-Military Road/Plaza Way/9th Avenue (SR 125)
         Tietan Street/ Plaza Way
         Plaza Shopping Center Driveway/Plaza Way
         Village Way/ Plaza Way
         3rd Avenue/Tietan Street

The analysis focuses on the traffic operations at these four study intersections and one site
access driveway during the weekday PM peak hour.

                         Existing (2010) Conditions
The following sections describe the existing conditions in the study area including the
surrounding roadway network and traffic control, PM peak hour traffic volumes, collision
history within the project vicinity, and intersection operations. This section also summarizes
existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and transit service in the vicinity of the project site.


Roadway Network & Traffic Control
The primary roadways within the site vicinity are described below.

9th Avenue (SR 125) is a north-south 5-lane roadway classified as a prinicipal arterial and
has a posted speed limit of 30 mph north of Plaza Way and 55 mph south of Plaza Way. The
roadway currently does not provide any sidewalks, bike lanes, or parking, but does provide a
seperated paved pedestrian path along the eastern side of the roadway within the project
vicinity.

Dalles Military Road is a two-lane minor arterial within the project vicinity. The roadway
generally travels from southwest to northeast and has a posted speed limit of 30 mph.
Neither bike lanes nor parking are provided but sidewalks are provided along both sides of
the roadway.

Plaza Way is classified as a minor arterial and provides two travel lanes in each direction,
although only one southbound through lane is provided between 9th Avenue and Tietan
Street.

Tietan Street is an east-west oriented roadway and is classified as a minor arterial. The
roadway provides one travel lane in each direction with intermittent sidewalks, parrallel
parking, and paved shoulders. Within the study area, the western leg of the Plaza Way/Tietan
Street intersection provides a signalized access into the Plaza Way Shopping Center.

Village Way and 3rd Avenue are two-lane local access streets. Intermittent sidwalks are
provided while parallel parking is generally allowed.

Existing channelization and traffic control at each study intersection along these roadways is
shown in Figure 3.


Traffic Volumes
Traffic volume data were collected for each study area intersection and the site access
driveway to characterize weekday traffic conditions during the PM peak hour. Traffic volumes
were collected in February 2010. Detailed volume data is provided in Appendix A and existing
weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 4.

Collision History
Collision records for the five most recent complete calendar years were reviewed within the
study area to identify any existing traffic safety issues. The most recent summary of collision
data from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is for the five-year
period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2008. Data for the complete 2009
calendar year is not yet available. A summary of the total and average annual number of
reported collisions at each study intersection is provided in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, all study intersections have experienced an average of less than five
collisions per year over the last five years. Of the study intersections, the Plaza Way/9th
Avenue (SR 125) intersection experienced the most collisions.


Traffic Operations
Existing traffic operations were evaluated by calculating levels of service at each study
intersection and the site access driveway. The operational characteristics of an intersection
are determined by calculating the intersection level of service (LOS). LOS for intersection
operations is described alphabetically (A through F). LOS is based on the calculated average
control delay per vehicle and is typically reported for the whole intersection for signalized and
all-way stop-controlled intersections, and by movement for two-way stop-controlled
intersections. Control delay is defined as the combination of initial deceleration delay, queue
move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Appendix B provides a more
detailed explanation of LOS.

Existing peak hour levels of service were calculated at study intersections and site access
driveway based on methodologies contained in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation
Research Board, 2000). Synchro 7.0 (Build 773) was used for the calculations. Results are
summarized in Table 2 and detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analysis are
included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2 all intersections and minor street approaches and driveway operate at
LOS D or better under existing conditions. All study intersections meet the City of Walla
Walla's LOS D standard.

Transit Service
Valley Transit provides bus service within the City of Walla Walla and operate nine fixed
routes throughout the city. Seven of the nine fixed bus routes operate between 6:15 AM and
5:50 PM with 30-minute headways between busses while the remaining two routes operate
with 60-minute headways. Two of the fixed bus routes operate within the study area.

Route 3 (2nd Avenue & Wa-Hi) operates within the study area and provides service between
the Valley Transit transfer center located on 4th Avenue between Rose Street and Main
Street and Walla Walla High School. Buses serving Route 3 arrive 30-minutes after one
another. Route 5 (Fairgrounds) operates between the transfer center, the VA Hospital, Walla
Walla County Fairgrounds,and Plaza Shopping Center with 30-minute headways between
bus arrivals. The bus stop nearest the proposed project is located at the Plaza Shopping
Center and exlusively serves Route 5.


Pedestrian & Bicycle Facilities
Concrete sidewalks are available along both sides of Plaza Way within the immediate vicinity
of the project site. The signalized study intersection of Plaza Way/9th Avenue (SR 125) and
Tietan Street/Plaza Way include pedestrian crosswalks, push buttons, and signal heads to
facilitate pedestrian travel.

Dedicated bike lanes are not provided along roadways within the study area.

        Future (2012) Without-Project Conditions
This section documents future without-project conditions. The proposed project is anticipated
to be constructed by the end 2012. Thus, 2012 was chosen as the appropriate horizon year.
The analysis of future (2012) transportation conditions provides the baseline against which
the impacts of the proposed project were evaluated.


Planned Improvements
The Walla Walla Six-Year Comprehensive Transportation Program Amended year 2009 for
2010-2015 was reviewed to determine if any roadway improvement projects are anticipated
to be built in the study area before completion of the proposed project in 2012. Although
improvements were identified for Plaza Way between 9th Avenue (SR 125) and Tietan Street
at the Tietan Street/3rd Avenue intersection, neither of these planned improvements would
be constructed before completion of the proposed project. No planned improvements within
the study area would impact the roadways or intersections before completion of construction
of the proposed project. Therefore the roadway network was assumed to remain unchanged
from existing conditions.


Traffic Volumes
An annual growth rate of 1.5-percent was provided by City staff and applied to existing (2010)
traffic counts in order to estimate future (2012) background traffic volumes at study area
intersections and site access driveway. No other development projects are planned for
construction and occupancy before 2012, and thus no additional pipeline project trips were
added to background traffic. Future (2012) without-project PM peak hour traffic volumes are
shown in Figure 5.


Traffic Operations
Levels of service (LOS) were calculated at the study intersections for future (2012) without-
project conditions. Table 3 (page 11) summarizes the results of the analysis with existing
LOS results shown for comparison. The LOS worksheets for future without-project conditions
are included in Appendix C. The roadway channelization used in the existing conditions
analysis was maintained for the future conditions analysis as no improvements are
anticipated by year 2012.

As shown in Table 3, all intersections and minor street approaches and driveways would
continue to operate at the same LOS value under both existing and future without-project
conditions. The average delay for signalized intersections or the critical movement at stop-
controlled intersections would increase by 1.9 seconds or less. All study intersections would
continue to meet the City of Walla Walla's LOS D standard.


Transit Service
Transit ridership is expected to increase slightly by 2012 as a result of general increases in
ridership demand. However, existing transit service within the area is anticipated to
accommodate anticipated growth.

               Future (2012) With-Project Conditions
This section documents the site-generated impacts of the proposed project on the
surrounding roadway network, including impacts to traffic volumes, intersection operations,
and the likelihood of collisions. Project-generated peak hour traffic volumes were estimated,
distributed, and assigned to the surrounding roadway network. Future with-project traffic
volumes were projected and peak hour intersection operations were evaluated. Future (2012)
without-project and with-project conditions were compared in order to identify impacts
resulting from traffic generated by the proposed project. In addition, the traffic operations
section includes a brief discussion on site circulation patterns related to site access through
the Plaza Way Shopping Center.


Project Trip Generation
Project traffic impacts were estimated based on estimated project trip generation. Vehicular
trip rates were based on information from the ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition (2008) for the
Senior Adult Housing ­ Attached (#252) land use. Table 4 summarizes the estimate trip
generation for the proposed project.

As shown in Table 4, the proposed project would generate an average of 418 weekday trips
with 16 trips occuring durring the weekday AM peak hour and 19 trips occuring during the PM
peak hour.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
Project traffic is anticipated to distribute to the surrounding local and regional street network
according to the percentages depicted in Figure 6. Trip distribution patterns for the project
were based upon directional peak hour counts available through the City of Walla Walla's
website for roadways within the project vicinity, land use data provided in the City's
Comprehensive Plan, and coordination with City staff.

The anticipated project trip distribution was used to assign net new PM peak hour project
trips to the surrounding network. These project trips are also shown in Figure 6. Note that
project trips assigned to the site access locations at the Plaza Way Shopping Center
driveway and Village Way were distributed approximately equally between the two locations
because of the multiple access points.

Site-generated PM peak hour traffic volumes were then added to future (2012) without-
project traffic volumes at the study intersections and site access driveways. The resulting
2012 with-project PM peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 7.

Traffic Operations Impacts
Future with-project PM peak hour levels of service were calculated for the study intersections.
These calculations evaluate future with-project intersection operations based on the trip
generation characteristics of the proposed project.

The intersection geometries used in the analysis of future without-project conditions were
also used to analyze future with-project conditions. For comparison purposes, the calculated
peak hour intersection operations for future (2012) without-project conditions are shown with
future with-project conditions in Table 5. LOS worksheets for the analysis of with-project
conditions are included in Appendix C.

3.   Volume-to-capacity ratio reported for signalized intersections.
4.   Intersection approach movement; NB is northbound.
5.   LOS D standard for all signalized intersections and critical movements at stop-controlled intersections on arterial roadways.


As shown in Table 5, all intersections and minor street approaches and driveways would
continue to operate at the same LOS value under both future without-project and with-project
conditions. The average delay for signalized intersections or the critical movement at stop-
controlled intersections would increase by 1.0 seconds or less. All study intersections would
continue to meet the City of Walla Walla's LOS D standard.

Traffic operations at the two intersections that would provide access to the site (Plaza Way
Shopping Center Driveway/Plaza Way and Village Way/Plaza Way) would operate
acceptably at LOS C or better. However, should congestion occasionally occur at the Plaza
Way Shopping Center Driveway/Plaza Way, vehicles egressing from the project site would be
able to recirculate through the shopping center parking lot to egress via the western leg of the
signalized Tietan Street/Plaza Way intersection.


Safety
Traffic generated by the proposed project would likely result in a proportionate increase in the
probability of collisions. However, historical collision rates are low and it is not anticipated that
the addition of project traffic would create a safety hazard or significantly increase the number
of reported collisions.

                                     Mitigation
Based on the results of the traffic impact analysis, the proposed development is expected to
result in a proportional increase on overall traffic within the study area with generally
negligible or minor affects on traffic operations. Operations would remain at or better than
City standards. No off-site improvements to mitigate project impacts would be required.

Transportation Impact Analysis
Walla Walla Senior Housing                                                             March 2010



                           Summary & Conclusions
         The proposed project is located in the City of Walla Walla and would include the
         construction of 120 multi-family senior housing units available exclusively to renters
         over the age of 62 years and would not provide any assisted care amenities. The
         project would be constructed by the end of 2012.

         The project site is located along the south side of 9th Avenue (SR 125) and north of
         Village Way and is currently vacant. Access to the proposed project would be
         provided via Fairway Drive and an easement through the parking lot of the Plaza
         Shopping Center to Plaza Way.

         The proposed project would generate an average of 418 weekday trips with 16 trips
         occuring durring the weekday AM peak hour and 19 trips occuring during the PM
         peak hour.

         The level of service (LOS) analysis indicates that project-generated traffic would have
         minimal impacts to traffic operations at study area intersections and site access
         driveway during the weekday PM peak hour. All study intersections and the site
         access driveway shared with the Plaza Way Shopping Center would meet the City of
         Walla Walla's operational standards.

         Based on anticipated operating conditions, no specific off-site mitigation would be
         required to serve the increase in project-related travel.

Appendix B:   LOS Definitions
                                          Highway Capacity Manual, 2000

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

        C                     >20 - 35                Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                             Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait through
                              >35 - 55

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

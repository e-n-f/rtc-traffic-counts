1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1.     Purpose of Report
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
Jim Wilson Road Development. The proposed site is located south of Jim Wilson Road and east of
Henry Harris Road in Lancaster, South Carolina. The purpose of this study is to determine the
potential impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic generated by the
proposed development.


1.2.     Study Objectives
The Jim Wilson Road Development is proposed to consist of 271 single-family detached homes.
One site driveway is proposed on Jim Wilson Road and another on Henry Harris Road. For
purposes of this study, it is assumed that the development will be fully built out by 2018.


Refer to Figure 1 in Appendix A for an illustration of the site location. Refer to Figure 2 for the
preliminary site plan. The objective of this report is to determine what geometric improvements
are necessary to mitigate traffic conditions on the transportation network surrounding the site with
the proposed development fully built out.

2.       AREA CONDITIONS
2.1.     Transportation Network Study Area
2.1.1.   Area Roadway System
The project study area for this TIS was determined through coordination with the South Carolina
Department of Transportation (SCDOT) and Lancaster County. Table 1 summarizes the
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. The SCDOT Functional Class map was used
to determine the classification of each road. The average daily traffic (ADT) volumes in vehicles
per day (vpd) were found in average annual daily traffic (AADT) data sheets from SCDOT. A field
visit was conducted to verify the existing cross-sections and speed limits in miles per hour (mph).

2.1.1.1. Existing
Existing lane configurations (number of traffic lanes on the intersection approach), storage
capacities, and other intersection and roadway information within the study area was collected
through field reconnaissance by Ramey Kemp and Associates, Inc. (RKA). Refer to Figure 3 for
the existing lane configurations and traffic control at study intersections.


2.1.1.2. Future
Based on discussions with local agencies, one roadway project was identified in the study area.
The bridge on 12 Mile Creek Road (over 12 Mile Creek) is expected to be closed in the future.
This will dead end 12 Mile Creek Road just east of the proposed development.

2.1.2.   Existing Traffic Volumes and Conditions
Existing peak hour traffic volumes were obtained from traffic counts performed at the intersection
of Jim Wilson Road and Henry Harris Road. The intersection of Jim Wilson Road and US 521 was
also counted. Traffic counts were conducted by RKA during the AM peak period (from 7:00 AM
to 9:00 AM) and during the PM peak period (from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM). No traffic count was
performed for the intersection of Henry Harris Road and 12 Mile Creek Road due to the expected
low volumes. Instead of counting the intersection, it was assumed each turn movement would
carry 10 vehicles per hour (vph). The through movements on Henry Harris Road were balanced
with the intersection of Jim Wilson Road and Henry Harris Road. A copy of the traffic count data
can be found in Appendix B of this report. Refer to Figure 4 for an illustration of the existing peak
hour traffic volumes.

2.1.3.   Area of Significant Traffic Impact
The study area for the TIS was determined through coordination with SCDOT and Lancaster
County and consists of the following intersections:
1)       Jim Wilson Road and Henry Harris Road
2)       Henry Harris Road and 12 Mile Creek Road (Site Drive 2)
3)       Jim Wilson Road and US 521
4)       Jim Wilson Road and Site Drive 1


2.2.     Study Area ­ Adjacent Land Use
2.2.1.   Existing Land Uses
The existing site is undeveloped. The surrounding land uses primarily consist of residential and
undeveloped land.

2.2.2.   Anticipated or Approved Future Development
Based on coordination with SCDOT and Lancaster County, there are three offsite developments
that were determined to have an impact on the project study area. The Cornerstone, Carolina
Reserve, and Walnut Creek developments are expected to generate trips that are not accounted for
in the existing traffic counts.


The Cornerstone development is located on the east side of the Jim Wilson Road and US 521
intersection. The site is partially built. For purposes of this report it was assumed that a 15,000
square foot pharmacy and 42,000 square feet of office space are currently built.


Carolina Reserve is a residential development located on the north side of Jim Wilson Road
between US 521 and Henry Harris Road. This site is also partially built. It was estimated that 225
homes have yet to be built.


Walnut Creek is located on the east side of US 521 just north of Waxhaw Highway. The
development will consist of single-family detached homes, a shopping center, county park, and
EMS station. A portion of the residential lots have been built. It was estimated that 1,790 homes
have yet to be built.



                                                 3

Trip distribution percentages and trip assignments were developed for these three developments.
Some trip distribution percentages were obtained from SCDOT for Cornerstone and Walnut
Creek. No information for Carolina Reserve was available. The available trip distribution
percentages, existing traffic patterns, location of population centers, and engineering judgment was
used to develop trip distribution percentages for the three sites within the study area. See Appendix
C for the trip generation, and available distribution percentages. Figures 5 through 7 illustrate the
distribution percentages used in this study for the three offsite developments. Figures 8 through 10
illustrate the trip assignments used in this study for the three offsite developments.


3.         PROJECTED TRAFFIC
3.1.       Site Traffic
In order to determine the future traffic conditions after the development is completed, an estimate
of traffic projected to travel to/from the proposed development is required.

3.1.1.     Trip Generation
The average weekday daily as well as AM and PM peak hour site trips for this study were
calculated based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition. At build-out, the site is expected to consist of 271 single-family detached homes. Table 2
presents a summary of the trip generation calculations for the proposed development.

3.1.2.   Trip Distribution and Assignment
For this study, the trip distribution percentages were developed based on existing traffic patterns,
location of population centers, and engineering judgment. Refer to Figures 11 and 12 for an
illustration of the site distribution percentages and assignments.


3.2.     Total Future Traffic
3.2.1.   No-Build Condition
In order to account for the growth of traffic and subsequent traffic conditions at a future year, no-
build traffic projections are needed. No-build traffic is the component of traffic due to the growth
of the community and surrounding area that is anticipated to occur regardless of whether the
proposed development is constructed. No-build traffic is comprised of projected traffic growth
within the study area and additional traffic created as a result of nearby future developments.


To account for the growth of traffic that is anticipated to occur regardless of the proposed
development, the existing traffic volumes were projected to the horizon year 2018 by applying a
compounded annual growth rate to traffic volumes at the study intersections. An annual growth
rate of 3% per year was used for this study per discussions with SCDOT and Lancaster County.
Refer to Figure 13 for an illustration of the projected 2018 peak hour traffic volumes.


Trips generated by the three offsite developments (Figures 8 through 10) were added to the
projected 2018 peak hour traffic volumes (Figure 13) to determine the future no-build traffic
volumes. Figure 14 illustrates the no-build 2018 peak hour traffic volumes.


3.2.2.   Build Condition
In order to determine peak hour traffic volumes with the development built out, the total peak hour
site traffic (Figure 12) was combined with the no-build 2018 traffic volumes (Figure 14) to
determine build 2018 traffic volumes. The build 2018 traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 15.

4.       TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
4.1.     Traffic Analysis Procedure
All study intersections (both unsignalized and signalized) were analyzed using the methodology
outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research
Board. A computer software package, Synchro (Version 7), was used to complete the analyses for
all of the study area intersections. Synchro 7 was developed by Trafficware Corporation and
allows the user to input data into the Synchro software and calculate the output based on
methodologies in the HCM.


Analysis results for signalized intersections provide level of service calculations for all approaches
and an overall resulting level of service. The capacity analysis for an unsignalized intersection
does not provide an overall level of service for the intersection, but rather a level of service for
movements and/or approaches that have a conflicting movement. Capacity and level of service are
the design criteria for this traffic study.


The HCM defines capacity as "the maximum hourly rate at which persons or vehicles can
reasonably be expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a given
time period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions". Level of service (LOS) is a
term used to represent different driving conditions, and is defined as a "qualitative measure
describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, and their perception by motorists and/or
passengers". Level of service varies from Level "A" representing free flow, to Level "F" where
greater vehicle delays are evident.


Refer to Table 3 for HCM levels of service and related average control delay per vehicle for both
signalized and unsignalized intersections. Control delay as defined by the HCM includes "initial
deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay". As shown in
Table 3, an average control delay of 40 seconds at a signalized intersection results in a LOS D
operation.

4.2.     Capacity and Level of Service at Study Intersections
4.2.1.   Jim Wilson Road and Henry Harris Road
The intersection of Jim Wilson Road and Henry Harris Road currently operates under four-way
stop control. All approaches currently operate at LOS A during both peak hours. The background
traffic growth and offsite developments are expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in
the No-Build (2018) scenario. The eastbound Jim Wilson Road approach is expected to operate
near capacity at LOS E during the PM peak hour of the No-Build (2018) scenario. Refer to Table 4
for a summary of the analysis results.


Improvements on Jim Wilson Road are recommended due to the background traffic growth and
offsite developments. In the No-Build (2018) Improvements By Others scenario, stop control was
removed on the Jim Wilson Road approaches. Turn lane warrant analysis was performed for this
intersection based on the guidelines in Chapter 15 of the SCDOT Highway Design Manual. The
no-build PM peak hour volumes meet the warrant for left turn lanes on the eastbound and
westbound Jim Wilson Road approaches. This is expected to provide LOS A on the Jim Wilson
Road approaches without creating queue issues on the side street.


SimTraffic 7.0 simulations were analyzed because Synchro does not calculate queue lengths at
four-way stop controlled intersections. SimTraffic 7.0 is part of the Synchro 7.0 software package
developed by Trafficware. It allows for simulation of the Synchro 7.0 traffic models. The
SimTraffic 7.0 results indicate that the recommended left turn movements would require the

Bold denotes improvement by others.



Both build scenarios are expected to result in slightly worse levels of service than the no-build
scenarios. The eastbound Jim Wilson Road approach is expected to operate at LOS F during the
PM peak hour of the Build (2018) scenario under four-way stop control. In the Build (2018)
Improvements By Others scenario, stop control was removed on the Jim Wilson Road approaches
and left turn lanes were added. This is expected to provide LOS A on the Jim Wilson Road
approaches without creating queue issues on the side street.

It is recommended that local agencies monitor traffic operations at this intersection. Traffic
volumes at the intersection are expected to increase due to the background traffic growth and
offsite developments. To provide additional capacity in the future, it is recommended to remove
the stop control on Jim Wilson Road. It is also recommended to separate the left turn movements
from the through movements on Jim Wilson Road by constructing left turn lanes with 150 feet of
storage. It is recommended these improvements be provided by others. No improvements by the
developer are recommended at this intersection. Refer to Appendix D for the Synchro capacity
analysis reports and SimTraffic queue reports.

4.2.2.      Henry Harris Road and 12 Mile Creek Road (Site Drive 2)
Henry Harris Road intersects 12 Mile Creek Road forming a tee intersection. Henry Harris Road is
free-flowing while 12 Mile Creek Road is stop controlled. The bridge on 12 Mile Creek Road
(over 12 Mile Creek) is expected to be closed in the future. This will dead end 12 Mile Creek
Road just east of the proposed development. The southbound left turn movement on Henry Harris
Road is expected to operate at LOS A during all scenarios. The 12 Mile Creek Road approach is
also expected to operate at LOS A during all scenarios. No turn lane warrants were met at this
intersection, so no improvements are recommended. Refer to Table 6 for a summary of the
analysis results. Refer to Appendix E for the Synchro capacity analysis reports.

4.2.3.   Jim Wilson Road and US 521
Jim Wilson Road and US 521 form a four-leg signalized intersection. The intersection currently
operates at LOS B during both peak hours. The background traffic growth and offsite
developments are expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in the No-Build (2018)
scenario. The eastbound Jim Wilson Road approach is expected to operate at LOS C during both
peak hours. All other approaches are expected to operate at LOS E or LOS F during both peak
hours of the No-Build (2018) scenario. The overall intersection is expected to operate at LOS F
during both peak hours of the No-Build (2018) scenario. Refer to Table 7 for a summary of the
analysis results. Refer to Appendix F for the Synchro capacity analysis reports.


The traffic impact study, dated July 2007, for the Cornerstone development included
recommendations for improvements at the intersection of Jim Wilson Road and US 521. It is
unclear at this time whether or not these improvements will be constructed. New recommendations
have been made for this intersection. The No-Build (2018) Improvements By Others scenario
includes the following improvements:
    ·    Construct dual westbound left and right turn lanes. The dual left turn lanes would need
         250 feet of storage. The dual right turn lanes would need 275 feet of storage.
    ·    Construct one northbound right turn lane with 150 feet of storage.
    ·    Extend the southbound left turn lane to provide 450 feet of storage. Change the southbound
         inner through lane to a left turn movement.
    ·    Construct an additional departure lane on eastbound Jim Wilson Road.


These recommended improvements by others are expected to provide additional capacity. The
No-Build (2018) Improvements By Others scenario is expected to provide an overall intersection
LOS C during the AM peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour.


The build scenario was modeled with and without the recommended improvements by others.
Without any improvements, the Build (2018) scenario is expected to increase in overall
intersection delay by approximately 15 percent during the AM peak hour and by 12 percent during
the PM peak hour. With the recommended improvements by others, the Build (2018)
Improvements By Others scenario is expected to increase in overall intersection delay by less than

4 percent during both peak hours. No improvements are recommended by the developer at this
intersection due to the low increase in delay.

4.2.4.      Jim Wilson Road and Site Drive 1
Site Drive 1 is proposed to intersect Jim Wilson Road east of Henry Harris Road. The intersection
would be stop controlled on Site Drive 1. A turn lane warrant analysis was performed for this
intersection based on the guidelines in Chapter 15 of the SCDOT Highway Design Manual. A
westbound Jim Wilson Road left turn lane is warranted based on the Build (2018) PM peak hour
volumes. It is recommended the developer construct a westbound Jim Wilson Road left turn lane
with 150 feet of storage. The westbound left turn movement is expected to operate at LOS A. The
Site Drive 1 approach is expected to operate at LOS C during the AM peak hour and at LOS D
during the PM peak hour. Refer to Table 8 for a summary of the analysis results. Refer to
Appendix G for the Synchro capacity analysis reports.

5.          CONCLUSIONS
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
Jim Wilson Road Development. The proposed site is located south of Jim Wilson Road and east of
Henry Harris Road in Lancaster, South Carolina. The purpose of this study is to determine the
potential impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic generated by the
proposed development.




                                                                        13
                                              Jim Wilson Road Development ­Traffic Impact Study

The Jim Wilson Road Development is proposed to consist of 271 single-family detached homes.
One site driveway is proposed on Jim Wilson Road and another on Henry Harris Road. For
purposes of this study, it is assumed that the development will be fully built out by 2018.


5.1.    Summary of Recommended Improvements
Based on the analysis results, certain geometric improvements have been identified. Refer to
Figure 16 for an illustration of the recommended lane configurations.


The following improvements have been identified to be constructed by others:


Jim Wilson Road and Henry Harris Road
   ·    Remove stop signs on Jim Wilson Road
   ·    Construct one eastbound Jim Wilson Road left turn lane with 150 feet of storage.
   ·    Construct one westbound Jim Wilson Road left turn lane with 150 feet of storage.


Jim Wilson Road and US 521
   ·    Extend the southbound US 521 left turn lane to provide 450 feet of storage.
   ·    Change the southbound US 521 inner through lane to a left turn lane.
   ·    Construct dual left turn lanes on westbound Jim Wilson Road. Each lane would have 250
        feet of storage. Construct an additional eastbound Jim Wilson Road departure lane.
   ·    Construct dual right turn lanes on westbound Jim Wilson Road. Each lane would have
        275 feet of storage.
   ·    Construct one northbound US 521 right turn lane with 150 feet of storage.


The following improvements have been identified to be constructed by the developer:


Jim Wilson Road and Site Drive 1
   ·    Construct one westbound Jim Wilson Road left turn lane with 150 feet of storage.

CHAPTER 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transportation impacts for the proposed Lake Oswego Indoor Tennis 
Center in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The proposed development is on a 9.59 acre site, of which 
approximately 7.67 acres is buildable due to the presence of sensitive land along the west 
property line that includes Pecan Creek.1 The proposed project includes an eight court indoor 
tennis center that would be allowable under existing zoning (PNA ­ Park and Natural Area).  
The proposed project is technically separate, but is often considered in conjunction with the 
Luscher Farms Master Plan, an area consisting of a multiuse sports field, a children's play area, 
walking and biking trails, a 114stall parking lot, offleash dog parks, community gardens, 
wetlands, open space, environmental/agricultural education facilities, and other support 
facilities. The proposed project was included in the recently conducted "Luscher Farms Master 
Plan Transportation Analysis," which 
addressed future (2032) 
transportation needs in the area.2 




                                                        T
The purpose of this transportation 
impact analysis (TIA) is to recommend 
mitigation measures that offset the 
transportation impacts that the 
                                                     AF
proposed development would have 
on the nearby transportation 
network, if any. The focus of the 
impact analysis is on the study 
intersections shown in Figure 1 and 
                                   R
site access. The study intersections 
and analysis periods (AM and PM 
peak hours) were identified through 
coordination with Lake Oswego                                              Figure 1: Study Area

Project Traffic Impact
Transportation impacts associated with the proposed development in the nearby area were 
evaluated at the study intersections.  Table 2 lists the existing intersection operations at the 
study intersection. As shown, these intersections currently operate within City and County 
standards, with the exception of Stafford Road/Childs Road, which operates below the County's 
level of service standard during both the AM and PM peak hours. This intersection currently 
meets peak hour traffic signal warrants during the PM peak hour and is borderline for the AM 
peak hour as well.

To determine whether the proposed project will result in offsite traffic impacts, future traffic 
volumes were estimated and intersection operations were evaluated for the following 
scenarios4: 
        
       Existing (2013) (AM and PM peak hour) 
        
       Existing (2013) with Project (AM and PM peak hour) 
        
       Future (2018) (AM and PM peak hour) 
        
       Future (2018) with Project (AM and PM peak hour) 
        
Table 3 provides the intersection operations for the future scenarios. As shown, the Stafford 
Road/Childs Road intersection, which operates below standards today for the Childs Road left 
turn movement, continues to operate poorly. The proposed project adds only 2 trips in the AM 
peak hour and 4 trips in the PM peak hour to this intersection.

* Intersection technically meets the City's level of service standard, however, the high v/c is cause for concern.
 
While the overall intersection delay is low enough the meet the City's LOS E mobility standard 
during all study peak periods and traffic volume scenarios, the westbound approach of the 
Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection is expected to exceed capacity during the AM peak 
hour in 2018 without the proposed project. Queues could occasionally extend over 40 vehicles 
during the AM peak hour.5 The volumetocapacity ratio during the AM peak hour in both 2013

and 2018 and during the PM peak hour in 2018 is a concern.  While the proposed project 
contributes to this problem, it only adds about 10 trips during the AM peak hour and 26 trips 
during the PM peak hour, or less than one percent of the total traffic in 2018 during the AM 
peak hour and less than two percent of total traffic during the PM peak hour. 
At least one previous study has indicated that a two lane roundabout would eventually be 
needed to improve operations and the intersection should be monitored to determine when a 
second lane would be warranted.6 


Recommendations and Mitigations
Though no offsite capacityrelated mitigations are needed by the proposed development by 
2018 to meet the City's mobility standard, the following project site concerns should be 
addressed:  
             Project frontage improvements should be constructed to Lake Oswego standards, as 
             defined in Lake Oswego Municipal Code, Article 42.03, Street Design Standards, in 




                                                        T
             coordination with City Public Works/Engineering staff. 
             The roundabout at Stafford Road/Rosemont Road/Atherton Drive should be monitored 
                                                     AF
             to determine when a second lane should be added. The proposed project contributes 
             less than one percent of the total traffic volume in 2018. 
             Available sight distance at the proposed project access should be at least 280 feet to the 
             west. Preliminary sight distance measurements indicate that this is feasible. 
             The unsignalized Stafford Road/Childs Road intersection fails today. The proposed 
             project contributes approximately 2 trips during the AM peak hour and 8 trips during 
                                   R
             the PM peak hour to this intersection. Current planning efforts in Clackamas County are 
             evaluating improvement alternatives for this intersection.7

CHAPTER 2: EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter provides documentation of existing study area conditions, including the project 
site, study area roadway network, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, existing traffic volumes and 
operations, and collision history. Supporting details are provided in the appendix.  
Project Site
The proposed project comprises 9.59 acres and is located north of Atherton Drive, just west of 
Stafford Road. The proposed site plan is shown in the appendix. The property is currently zoned 
PNA ­ Parks and Natural Area and is part of the Luscher Farms Master Plan area. The Luscher 
Farms Master Plan includes approximately 152 acres in the northeast quadrant of the Stafford 
Road/Rosemont Road intersection, in Lake Oswego. A tennis facility would meet the planning 
code as an allowed use, but would require a Conditional Use approval.8 There will be one access 
to the site on Atherton Drive, approximately 150175 feet west of Stafford Road, with an 
emergency access provided to the existing gravel road north of the proposed project site. The 




                                                        T
area surrounding the proposed project site is typically rural residential and agricultural. 
The proposed project is technically separate, but is often considered in conjunction with the 
Luscher Farms Master Plan, an area consisting of a multiuse sports field, a children's play area, 
                                                     AF
walking and biking trails, a 114stall parking lot, offleash dog parks, community gardens, 
wetlands, open space, environmental/agricultural education facilities, and other support 
facilities. The proposed project was included in the recently conducted "Luscher Farms Master 
Plan Transportation Analysis," which addressed future (2032) transportation needs in the area.9 
Study Area Roadway Network
                                   R
Key study area roadways are listed in Table 4 along with their jurisdiction, functional 
classification, and other important roadway characteristics. All study area roadways are owned 
and maintained by the City of Lake Oswego, except for Stafford Road south of Overlook Drive. 
                D

The City of Lake Oswego has maintenance jurisdiction over Stafford Road from Lake Oswego 
City Limits (just south of Overlook Drive) south through the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road 
roundabout.  The functional classifications for Lake Oswego roadways are provided in the Lake 
Oswego Comprehensive Plan.

To perform the analysis, traffic counts were collected during the AM (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and 
PM peak periods (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) on a weekday.11 The peak hour traffic volumes analyzed 
under existing conditions are shown in Figure 2, and the detailed twohour traffic counts are 
included in the appendix. The purpose of intersection analysis is to ensure that the 
transportation network remains within desired performance levels required by Clackamas 
County and the City of Lake Oswego. Intersections are the focus of the analysis because they

Intersection Performance Measures
While analysis of traffic flows is useful in reaching an understanding of the general nature of 
traffic in an area, traffic volumes alone indicate neither the ability of the street network to carry 
additional traffic, nor the quality of service provided by street facilities. For this reason, the 
VolumetoCapacity Ratio (V/C) is used to relate traffic volumes with roadway capacities. In 
addition, the concept of Level of Service (LOS) has been developed to correlate traffic volume 
data to subjective descriptions of traffic performance at intersections. 
             Level of service (LOS): A "report card" rating (A through F) based on the average delay 
             experienced by vehicles at the intersection.12 LOS A, B, and C indicate conditions where 
             traffic moves without significant delays over periods of peak hour travel demand. LOS D 
             and E are progressively worse operating conditions. LOS F represents conditions where 
             average vehicle delay has become excessive and demand has exceeded capacity. This 
             condition is typically evident in long queues and delays. 
             Volumetocapacity (v/c) ratio: A decimal representation (typically between 0.00 and 




                                                        T
             1.00) of the proportion of capacity that is being used at a turn movement, approach leg, 
             or intersection. It is determined by dividing the peak hour traffic volume by the hourly 
             capacity of a given intersection or movement. A lower ratio indicates smooth operations 
                                                     AF
             and minimal delays. As the ratio approaches 1.00, congestion increases and 
             performance is reduced. If the ratio is greater than 1.00, the turn movement, approach 
             leg, or intersection is oversaturated and usually results in excessive queues and long 
             delays. 
Required Mobility Standards
                                   R
Study intersections are located in both the City of Lake Oswego and Clackamas County. 
Clackamas County requires unsignalized intersections to operate at a level of service "D" or 
better and Lake Oswego requires signalized, roundabout and unsignalized intersections to 
operate at a level of service "E" or better.13 These mobility standards are summarized in Table 
                D

Existing Operating Conditions
Existing traffic operating conditions at the study intersections were determined based on the 
2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology14 for signalized and unsignalized intersections, 
consistent with City and County standards. The roundabout was analyzed using the 2010 
Highway Capacity Manual methodology for roundabouts.15 The performance measures include 
the estimated average delay, level of service (LOS), and volumetocapacity (V/C) ratio of each 
study intersection. As shown in Table 6, operating standards are currently met at all of the 
study intersections, except for Stafford Road/Childs Road, which operates at level of service E 
for the eastbound left turn during the AM peak hour and at level of service F for the eastbound 
left turn during the PM peak hour. Intersection operational results are attached in the 
appendix.

Signal Warrants
Since the Stafford Road/Childs Road intersection does not meet county standards under 
existing conditions, peak hour traffic signal warrants were checked for this intersection.16 Peak 
hour signal warrants were met for this intersection in the PM peak hour and may be met in the 
AM peak hour.

Safety
Collision History
The collision records of the study intersections were obtained for 2007 through 2011 from the 
Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) website.17 Based on the collision data and peak 
hour traffic counts, collision rates were estimated at the study intersections and are shown in  
Table 7, along with the breakdown of collisions by severity. A collision rate greater than or 
equal to 1.0 collision per million entering vehicles (MEV) generally indicates a higher than 
average collision rate and that additional collision analysis should be performed. None of the 
study intersections had a collision rate in excess of 1.0 collision per MEV.

CHAPTER 3: PROJECT IMPACTS
This chapter reviews the impacts that the proposed Lake Oswego Tennis Center development 
would have on the study area transportation system.  
Although the development would generate traffic throughout the week, the weekday AM and 
PM peak hours were the periods analyzed since this is when the greatest impact is expected 
(the sum of project traffic and traffic on adjacent streets is generally greatest during this 
period). The peak hour analysis includes trip generation, trip distribution, and future year traffic 
volumes and operating conditions. This chapter includes a site plan review. First, the proposed 
development is described. 
Proposed Development
The project site is currently zoned PNA (Park and Natural Area). The proposed project is an 
allowable use in this zone and the proposed development is planned to include an eight court 
indoor tennis facility. Primary access to the site will be provided via Atherton Drive, 
approximately 150175 feet west of the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout. The 




                                                        T
proposed site plan is included in the appendix.  
Trip Generation
                                                     AF
Trip generation was estimated for the proposed project site based on existing trip generation 
data provided by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) and assumptions about the trip 
generating characteristics of the planned activity provided by the City's Parks & Recreation 
Department.22 Since trip generation assumptions provided by the City were similar to those 
provided by ITE, the ITE data was used, since it is a nationally recognized source. 
                                   R
Table 8 summarizes the AM and PM peak hour and daily vehicle trip generation estimates for 
the project. As shown, the overall development is expected to generate 10 (5 in, 5 out) AM 
peak hour trips and 27 (14 in, 13 out) PM peak hour trips. These trips were added to the 
roadway network for the future operations analysis to determine whether the site would 
                D

impact the study intersections. Overall, the site is expected to generate 310 daily trips.

Trip Distribution
The trip distribution for the proposed project 
was estimated based on existing traffic patterns 
in the area and the general locations of Lake 
Oswego residents, who are expected to be the 
primary users of the facility. The trip distribution 
percentages were reviewed with Lake Oswego 
staff and are shown in Figure 3.  Resulting project 
trips are shown in Figure 4.

Future Traffic Volumes and Operating Conditions
                           R
As discussed with Lake Oswego staff, future operating conditions were analyzed at the study 
intersections for the existing plus background condition (2018), both without and with the 
proposed project. The operations analysis was performed both with and without the proposed 
              D

project in order to estimate the project's impact. Therefore, there are two future traffic 
scenarios: 
            2018 with Background (AM and PM peak hour) 
            2018 with Background with Project (AM and PM peak hour)

To account for background growth and future developments, Metro's most recent travel 
demand model was used to forecast the future background traffic volumes (i.e., the "No Build" 
scenarios), consistent with the City's assumptions for their Transportation System Plan, which is 
currently under development. 23  The estimated trips from the proposed development were 
then added to the nobuild volumes to estimate the "with Project" scenarios traffic volumes. 
Figure 6:  2018 Background Traffic Volumes shows the traffic volumes for the 2018 background 
scenario and Figure 7 provides the traffic volumes for the 2018 background plus project 
scenario.

   Metro's Regional Travel Demand Models for 2010 and 2035 were used to develop prorated growth estimates for the period 
between when the traffic counts were collected and 2018. Traffic volumes were postprocessed according to the methodology 
described in NCHRP (National Cooperative Highway Research Project) 255, resulting in the estimated 2018 background traffic 
volumes.

Table 10 summarizes the study intersection operating conditions with the addition of 
background (2018) and proposed project traffic. All of the study intersections meet the 
applicable standards with the addition of future background and proposed project traffic, 
except the Stafford Road/Childs Road intersection, which continues to not meet the County's 
level of service standard.  
While the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection technically meets the City's level of 
service standard, the westbound approach is expected to operate with a volumetocapacity 
ratio exceeding 1.0 during the AM peak hour, even before the proposed project is added. 
Queues could occasionally extend over 40 vehicles during the AM peak hour.24 The proposed 
project adds 10 trips through the roundabout during the AM peak hour, less than one percent 
of the total trips in 2018. This intersection should be monitored to determine when 
improvements should be made to relieve this condition.

Mitigation
 
Table 11 summarizes intersection operations at the Stafford Road/Childs Road intersection, 
assuming a traffic signal is in place in 2018. The intersection would operate acceptably with the 
installation of a traffic signal during both the AM and PM peak hours. The intersection level of 
service and volumetocapacity ratio is the same either with or without the proposed project.

Site Access Review
A preliminary site plan was reviewed to address internal circulation. Potential concerns 
regarding access and sight distance are addressed below. A copy of the preliminary site plan is 
included in the appendix. 
Sight Distance and Vehicular Access
Access to the site would be provided by a driveway on Atherton Drive, approximately 150175 
feet west of the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road/Atherton Drive roundabout. The proposed 
access should be developed as far west as possible from the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road 
roundabout to maximize sight distance, and it should also provide at least 280 feet of clear 
sight distance to the west along Atherton Drive.26 Prior to plat approval, it should be 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of Lake Oswego staff that adequate sight distance can be 
provided at all proposed access driveways. Prior to occupancy, sight distance will need to be 
certified by a registered engineer. 
In addition to the site access, an emergency vehicle access will be provided on the existing 




                                                        T
gravel road north of the project site, approximately 650 feet north of the Stafford 
Road/Rosemont Road roundabout on Stafford Road.  
Access Spacing Standards
                                                     AF
Lake Oswego's access spacing standards do not provide guidelines on local streets, however 
access to a collector or arterial shall be at least 100 feet from the nearest intersection 
centerline.27 Since the proposed project is adjacent to a major intersection (Stafford 
Road/Rosemont Road), it is recommended that the access be developed as far from the 
intersection as possible. There is no access spacing conflict with the proposed access location 
                                   R
since the property to the south is outside the urban growth boundary and the property to the 
west is the backyard of an existing single family residence with access on a side street 
approximately 900 feet to the west of the proposed project access. 
                D

In addition to the site access, an emergency vehicle access will be provided on the existing 
gravel road north of the project site, approximately 650 feet north of the Stafford 
Road/Rosemont Road roundabout on Stafford Road.

CHAPTER 4: RECOMMENDATIONS AND MITIGATIONS
Though no offsite capacityrelated mitigations are needed by the proposed development by 
2018 to meet the City's mobility standard, the following project site concerns should be 
addressed:  
             Project frontage improvements should be constructed to Lake Oswego standards, as 
             defined in Lake Oswego Municipal Code, Article 42.03, Street Design Standards, in 
             coordination with City Public Works/Engineering staff. 
             The roundabout at Stafford Road/Rosemont Road/Atherton Drive should be monitored 
             to determine when a second lane should be added. The proposed project contributes 
             less than one percent of the total traffic volume in 2018. 
             Available sight distance at the proposed project access should be at least 280 feet to the 
             west. Preliminary sight distance measurements indicate that this is feasible. 
             The unsignalized Stafford Road/Childs Road intersection fails today. The proposed 




                                                        T
             project contributes approximately 2 trips during the AM peak hour and 8 trips during 
             the PM peak hour to this intersection. Current planning efforts in Clackamas County are 
             evaluating improvement alternatives for this intersection.28

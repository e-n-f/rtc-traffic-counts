1 INTRODUCTION
Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. (Kimley-Horn) was retained by Metropolitan Planning
Group to prepare a traffic impact study for the proposed San Ramon Valley Apartments
mixed-use development project (the “proposed project”), to be located at the southwest
corner of the San Ramon Valley Boulevard and Deerwood Road-Fostoria Way
intersection in San Ramon, California. The proposed development is located within the
Crow Canyon Specific Plan (CCSP) Area and is understood to be consistent with the
zoning and development intensity considered in the CCSP, and in the City’s adopted
General Plan 2035. The project is anticipated to include 169 apartment units and 6,105
square feet of new commercial retail space. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the
project site in relation to the City of San Ramon

This traffic study was prepared based on discussions with, and criteria set forth by, the
City of San Ramon and procedures provided in the latest version of the Contra Costa
Transportation Authority’s (CCTA) Technical Procedures. This study addresses the
traffic and transportation effects of the proposed project in order to assist the project
sponsor and the City in project planning and in determining conditions of approval for
the project. Results of the traffic study will be used in the preparation of the project’s
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review to assess the impacts of the
proposed project.

1.1 Study Methodology
Analysis Scenarios
The traffic study was based on the following development conditions:

   l   Existing (2015) Conditions – Based on current traffic counts in 2015 and
       existing roadway geometry and traffic control.
   l   Existing (2015) plus Project Conditions – Based on existing traffic volumes
       and traffic generated by the proposed project.
   l   Cumulative (2035) Conditions – Based on 2035 future year traffic forecasts
       from the CCTA Travel Demand Forecast Model. Future year will correspond with
       approximate buildout of City’s General Plan.
   l   Cumulative (2035) plus Project Conditions – Based on the CCTA traffic model
       2035 forecasts and traffic generated by the proposed project.

Operating Conditions and Criteria for Intersections
Analysis of significant environmental impacts at intersections is based on the concept of
Level of Service (LOS). The LOS of an intersection is a qualitative measure used to
describe operational conditions. LOS ranges from A (best), which represents minimal



                                          1                                      February 2016

                                                                       Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report

delay, to F (worst), which represents heavy delay and a facility that is operating at or
near its functional capacity.

Levels of Service for this study were determined using methods defined in the Highway
Capacity Manual, 2010 (HCM) as calculated using SYNCHRO (Version 9) traffic
analysis software. Analysis parameters and input data requirements were consistent
with guidelines found in the CCTA Technical Procedures Appendix C (Guidelines for the
Use of the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual Operational Method). Levels of service were
determined using HCM 2000 methodology in cases where HCM 2010 was not
compatible with U-turning movements at signalized intersections.

The HCM includes procedures for analyzing side-street stop controlled (SSSC), all-way
stop-controlled (AWSC), and signalized intersections. The SSSC procedure defines
LOS as a function of average control delay for each minor street approach movement.
Conversely, the AWSC and signalized intersection procedures define LOS as a function
of average control delay for the intersection as a whole. For SSSC intersections, level of
service is reported for the worst approach movement. Table 1 relates the operational
characteristics associated with each LOS category for signalized and unsignalized
intersections.

Per the City of San Ramon General Plan 2035 Circulation Policy 5.1-I-1, the City strives
to maintain traffic LOS C or better as the standard at all intersections with a maximum

LOS D during AM (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and PM (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) peak periods.

Signal Warrants
Traffic signals may be justified when traffic operations fall below acceptable thresholds
and when one or more signal warrants are satisfied. At unsignalized study intersections,
traffic volumes were compared against the peak hour warrant in the 2014 California
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA MUTCD) 1. Traffic Signal Warrant #3 –
Peak Hour Volume Warrant is satisfied when traffic volumes on the major and minor
approaches exceed thresholds for one hour of the day. The Peak Hour Warrant is
generally the first warrant to be satisfied. Other warrants such as those for minimum
vehicle volumes, interruption of continuous traffic, and traffic progression were not
evaluated because they generally require higher traffic volumes to be satisfied.

Queuing
The effects of vehicle queuing were also analyzed and the 95 th percentile queue is
reported for all study intersections. The 95 th percentile queue length represents a
condition where 95 percent of the time during the peak hour, traffic volumes will be less
than or equal to the queue length determined by the analysis. This is referred to as the
“95th percentile queue.” Average queuing is generally less.

Queues that exceed the provided turn pocket length can create potentially hazardous
conditions by blocking or disrupting through traffic in adjacent travel lanes. However,
these potentially hazardous queues are generally associated with left turn movements.
Locations where the right turn pocket storage is exceeded are not considered potentially
hazardous because the right turn movement typically goes at the same time as the
through movement and the additional vehicles that spill out of the turn pocket are not
likely to hinder or disrupt the adjacent through traffic, as would be the case in most left
turn pockets.

The City of San Ramon does not have standards for queuing and considers queuing
deficiencies as operational issues. Thus, for purposes of this analysis, operational
deficiencies were considered to occur under conditions where project traffic causes the
queue in a left turn pocket to extend beyond the turn pocket by 25 feet or more (i.e., the
length of one vehicle) into adjacent traffic lanes that operate (i.e., move) separately from
the left turn lane. Where the vehicle queue already exceeds that turn pocket length
under pre-project conditions, a queuing deficiency would occur if project traffic
lengthens the queue by 75 feet or more.

Thresholds of Significance
Based on the significance criteria used by the City of San Ramon in accordance with
the City of San Ramon General Plan 2035 and the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) guidelines for the determination of transportation impacts, the proposed project
would trigger a significant impact if it would:

    l   Cause a study intersection to exceed the current General Plan’s level of service
        standard of LOS C, with LOS D permitted for no more than two hours of the day
        (AM and PM peak hours).2
    l   Fail to provide for reasonably efficient pedestrian and bicycle circulation, through
        implementation of City standards and the current General Plan’s proposed
        bicycle and trail network or General Plan policies related to pedestrian and
        bicycle circulation.
    l   Create a condition, either by design or by the generation of traffic, that creates a
        barrier to, or unsafe condition for pedestrian and bicycle circulation.
    l   Create a transit demand that would exceed currently planned transit service.
    l   Cause peak hour vehicle queues to exceed available turn pocket storage by at
        least one car length, or increase peak hour queues by at least three car lengths
        for locations where queue lengths already exceed available turn pocket storage
        without the addition of the project.

1.2 Study Intersections Included in Analysis

The proposed project will generate new vehicular trips that will increase traffic volumes
on the nearby street network. To assess changes in traffic conditions associated with
the project, the following intersections, illustrated in Figure 1, were selected in
coordination with the City of San Ramon for evaluation in this traffic study:

    1. Crow Canyon Road/San Ramon Valley Boulevard
    2. Crow Canyon Road/I-680 SB Off-Ramp
    3. Crow Canyon Road/I-680 NB Off-Ramp
    4. Crow Canyon Road/Crow Canyon Place
    5. Fostoria Way/Crow Canyon Place
    6. Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way/San Ramon Valley Boulevard
    7. Deerwood Road/Omega Road/Old Crow Canyon Road
    8. Old Crow Canyon Road/Crow Canyon Road
    D1. Deerwood Road Site Driveway

 This criteria is consistent with, if not slightly more conservative than, the CCTA Multimodal
Transportation System Objective (MTSO) for intersections on Routes of Regional Significance.

      D2. San Ramon Valley Boulevard Site Driveway

2 EXISTING (2015) CONDITIONS
This chapter provides a description of the existing land uses and transportation system
within the vicinity of the proposed project.

2.1 Existing Site Uses
The proposed project would be constructed on two parcels at the southwest corner of
Deerwood Road and San Ramon Valley Boulevard. The site is currently occupied by
Outpost Sports Bar & Grill and Windmill Farms Produce. The proposed development
would displace the sports bar/restaurant and Windmill Farms.

2.2 Existing Roadway Network
The existing circulation network within the City of San Ramon is comprised of
interstates, arterials, collector streets, and local streets. The Interstate 680 (I-680)
freeway and several of the City’s arterial streets are designated as Routes of Regional
Significance by CCTA and the Tri Valley Transportation Council. Routes of Regional
Significance are major arterials and freeways that primarily serve regional traffic. A
Route of Regional Significance is required to meet designated Multimodal Traffic
Service Objectives (MTSOs) as mandated by Contra Costa Measure J and included in
the Tri-Valley Transportation Plan and Action Update. Within the vicinity of the study
area, I-680, Crow Canyon Road and San Ramon Valley Boulevard are identified as
Routes of Regional Significance. Below is a description of the principal roadways
included in this study.

I-680
I-680 is a north-south freeway serving San Ramon and the Tri-Valley and is classified
as a Route of Regional Significance. It connects San Jose and I-280 in the south to I-
80 in Solano County in the north. Within the study area, I-680 has three mixed flow
lanes and one high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction. In addition, one
auxiliary lane exists between Crow Canyon Road and Bollinger Canyon Road on I-680
in both directions. The nearest interchange on I-680 within the vicinity of the proposed
project is at Crow Canyon Road. Within the vicinity of the study area, I-680 carries
approximately 161,000 vehicles per day3.

Crow Canyon Road
Crow Canyon Road is an east-west arterial roadway that connects to the community of
Blackhawk to the east and the city of Castro Valley to the west. Crow Canyon Road is
classified as a Route of Regional Significance. In the vicinity of the proposed project, it

is a six lane divided roadway with a posted speed limit of 45 mph west of Old Crow
Canyon Road, 40 mph between Old Crow Canyon Road and Alcosta Boulevard, and 45
mph east of Alcosta Boulevard. No on-street parking is permitted on either side of the
street.

San Ramon Valley Boulevard
San Ramon Valley Boulevard is a north-south arterial roadway located west of I-680
and is classified as a Route of Regional Significance. It connects State Route 84 (SR
84) (in Sunol) in the south and Walnut Creek in the north. South of I-580, it is known as
Foothill Road, and north of Diablo Road in Danville it is known as Hartz Avenue, then
Danville Boulevard, and then South Main Street. The posted speed limit is 35 mph
north of Norris Canyon Road and 45 mph south of Norris Canyon Road. Within the
vicinity of the proposed project, on-street parking is permitted on the west side of the
street for a limited segment south of Deerwood Road-Fostoria Way.

Deerwood Road
Deerwood Road is an east-west collector roadway that connects Crow Canyon Road to
the west and San Ramon Valley Boulevard to the east, where it becomes Fostoria Way.
In the vicinity of the project, it is a four lane divided highway with a posted speed limit of
40 mph. No on-street parking is permitted on either side of the street.

Fostoria way is an east-west collector roadway. It extends from San Ramon Valley
Boulevard to the west, where it becomes Deerwood Road, to a cul-de-sac to the east,
which abuts various commercial properties beyond Camino Ramon-Crow Canyon
Place. To the west of Camino Ramon, it is a four lane divided roadway with a posted
speed limit of 35 mph. To the east of Camino Ramon, it is a two lane undivided
roadway. On-street parking is permitted on both sides of the street east of Camino
Ramon-Crow Canyon Place.

Crow Canyon Place
Crow Canyon Place is a north-south collector roadway that connects Fostoria Way to
the north, where it becomes Camino Ramon in the Town of Danville, and terminates at
the Crow Canyon Commons shopping center to the south. Between Crow Canyon Road
and Fostoria Way, it has two travel lanes in each direction, a two-way left turn lane, and
a posted speed limit of 25 mph. No on-street parking is permitted on either side of the
street.

2.3 Existing Site Access
The existing site is currently accessible via three driveways: two driveways on
Deerwood Road and one driveway on San Ramon Valley Boulevard. All access points
allow right in/right out movements only. As the site is currently configured, vehicles can
utilize all three driveways for ingress and egress.

Access to the proposed project site will be provided via one driveway on Deerwood
Road and one driveway on San Ramon Valley Boulevard.

2.4 Existing Lane Configurations and Traffic Control
Existing intersection lane configurations and traffic control are illustrated in Figure 2.
Traffic signals in the study area are located at all study intersections with the exception
of Deerwood Road/Omega Road-Old Crow Canyon Road, which is an AWSC
intersection, and the two project driveways, where the driveways approaches are stop-
controlled. At San Ramon Valley Boulevard/Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way, the
northbound and southbound approaches have wide bike lanes that effectively function
as right-turn lanes. To reflect actual traffic conditions, these were considered right-turn
lanes in the LOS analysis of this intersection.

2.5 Existing Peak Hour Intersection Volumes
Where available, recent AM and PM peak hour turning movement volumes were
provided by the City. For the remaining study intersections, new traffic counts were
collected by Kimley-Horn during the AM (7-9 AM) and PM (4-6 PM) peak periods on
September 15, 2015. Table 2 below summarizes the study intersections and traffic
volume data sources. Weekday AM and PM peak hour turning movement volumes are
shown in Figure 3. Traffic volume data sheets are shown in Appendix A.

2.6 Existing Transit Facilities
County Connection (operated by the Central Contra Costa County Transit Authority)
provides bus service in San Ramon and neighboring cities. Routes 21, 36, 92X, and
95X provide service within the vicinity of the project site, and provide access to locations
within the City of San Ramon, as well as destinations along the I-680 corridor, including
Walnut Creek, Danville, Dublin, and Pleasanton.

Route 21 provides local service between Walnut Creek BART station and San Ramon
Transit Center. It operates from 5:30 AM to 11:20 PM during weekdays, with 30 minute
headways throughout the day. No weekend service is provided for this route.

Route 36 provides local service between San Ramon Transit Center and
Dublin/Pleasanton BART station. It operates from 6:20 AM to 9:00 PM during
weekdays, with 1 hour headways throughout the day. No weekend service is provided
for this route.

Route 92X provides express service between the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE)
Pleasanton Train Station and Crow Canyon Road/Crow Canyon Place in San Ramon. It
operates during weekday AM and PM peak periods only, with a total of 6 buses running
in each direction per day. No weekend service is provided for this route.

Route 95X provides express service between Walnut Creek BART station and San
Ramon Transit Center. It operates during weekday AM and PM peak periods only, with
a total of 8 buses running in each direction per day. No weekend service is provided for
this route.

The following bus stops are located within convenient walking distance (1/4-mile) of the
proposed project:

   l   Northeast corner of Deerwood Road-Fostoria Way/San Ramon Valley Boulevard
       intersection (approximately 300 feet from project site)

                                                          Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report



Additional bus stops serving Route 36 and Route 92X are located within approximately
0.25 to 0.5 miles walking distance from the project site.

The San Ramon Transit Center is located south of Executive Parkway and east of
Camino Ramon. The Transit Center serves commuters within San Ramon, as well as
those using bus service to connect to and from other Tri-Valley destinations and BART
stations in Walnut Creek and Dublin/Pleasanton.

2.7 Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Sidewalks provide walking facilities between the proposed project, nearby transit stops,
and the adjacent residential and commercial land uses. Sidewalks are provided along
all streets adjacent to the project site. The only gaps identified within the existing
pedestrian system within the general proximity of the project site are along Old Crow
Canyon Road, where there are limited sidewalks along the west side of the street, and
along Crow Canyon Road, where sidewalks are not provided along the north side of the
street between the I-680 ramps.

The City of San Ramon has an extensive bicycle network, comprised of the following
types of facilities:

   l   Class I Bikeway (Bike Path): A right-of-way that is completely separated from
       any street. These facilities are usually multi-use trails that accommodate
       pedestrian and bicyclists.
   l   Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane): A one-way striped and signed lane for bicyclists
       on either side of the street.
   l   Class III Bike Route: A street where bicyclists and automobiles share the
       traveled way marked only by signs.
The Iron Horse Trail, a Class I Bikeway, extends approximately 30 miles from
Pleasanton to Concord along the former San Ramon Branch Line railroad right-of-way.
The nearest access points to the Iron Horse Trail are located where the trail crosses
both Fostoria Way and Crow Canyon Road, just east of Camino Ramon. Within the
project’s vicinity, Class II bike lanes are present along Deerwood Road-Fostoria Way
(from Deerwood Drive to Camino Ramon-Crow Canyon Place) and San Ramon Valley
Boulevard.

2.8 Existing Intersection Operations
Traffic operations were evaluated at signalized and unsignalized intersections under
existing traffic conditions using the volumes summarized in Figure 3 and using existing

3 PROPOSED PROJECT
3.1 Proposed Site Uses
As noted previously, the project applicant is proposing a mixed-use development with
169 apartment units and approximately 6,105 square feet of new street-level
commercial retail space. The proposed project would redevelop the existing site,
removing the existing 7,800 square-foot sports bar/restaurant and the existing 6,200
square-foot Windmill Farms produce market.

Site access will be provided via one driveway on Deerwood Road and one driveway on
San Ramon Valley Boulevard, both restricted to right-in/right-out only access. The
Deerwood Road driveway will provide a gated entry to one residential parking area
within an on-site garage. The driveway on San Ramon Valley Boulevard will provide
access a second gate-controlled residential parking area within the garage, as well as
parking for visitors and retail uses included in the project. There is no vehicular
connectivity within the garage between the two parking areas. A little more than half (53
percent) of the residential parking is accessed via the San Ramon Valley Boulevard
driveway, while the remaining residential (47 percent) is accessed via Deerwood Road.
A new cutout will be constructed along Deerwood Road to provide five (5) new on-street
parallel parking stalls along the project frontage. The project site plan is shown in
Figure 4.

3.1.1 Project Phasing
Project development will generally occur in one phase consisting of demolition, site
preparation, and construction. Upon completion of the proposed development, the
project site will be fully operational. In a subsequent phase, the project may also include
an upgrade to the Windmill Farms facility and a connection to the adjacent property to
the south, containing an existing pet clinic and currently undergoing development of
new retail (sushi restaurant). The connection route would extend from the internal drive
aisle, between where San Ramon Creek enters the culvert and the Windmill Farms
storage area, through to the adjacent parking area, behind the pet clinic. This would
provide for vehicle access between the two adjacent parcels. While the connection
would be somewhat indirect, this “back of house” connection would also provide
opportunity for left-turn access into and out of the San Ramon Valley Boulevard portion
of the project site. While this connection is not assumed as part of the primary traffic
analysis presented in this study, an assessment of project access and circulation with
the addition of this connection is provided in the Site Access and Circulation discussion
in a later section of this report.

3.2 Project Trip Generation
Trip generation for development projects is typically calculated based on rates
contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineer’s (ITE) publication, Trip Generation
Manual. Trip Generation is a standard reference used by jurisdictions throughout the


                                          11                                     February 2016
                                                                   San Ramon Valley Apartments
                                                              Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report

country for the estimation of trip generation potential of proposed developments. Trip
Generation Manual, 9th Edition, was used to estimate daily and peak-hour trip
generation that can be attributed to the proposed project.

A trip is defined in Trip Generation as a single or one-directional vehicle movement with
either the origin or destination at the project site. In other words, a trip can be either “to”
or “from” the site. In addition, a single customer visit to a site is counted as two trips
(i.e., one to and one from the site).

For purposes of determining the worst-case impacts of traffic on the surrounding street
network, the trips generated by a proposed development are typically estimated
between the weekday hours of 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM. While the project itself
may generate more traffic during some other time of the day such as around noon, the
peak of “adjacent street traffic” represents the time period when the uses generally
contribute to the greatest amount of congestion, with the weekday PM peak commonly
being the greatest congestion period. For the purposes of this study, weekday AM and
PM peak hour project trip generation estimates were developed in order to study the
impacts of traffic on the surrounding street network. Daily project trip generation
estimates were also provided for reference purposes.

ITE’s land use for apartments (Land Use Code 220) was used for the residential
component of the proposed project.

The specific type of retail businesses that will ultimately occupy the ground floor space
of the proposed project are unknown at this time, although it is reasonable to assume
that based on the context of the project, the retail space could include a small
café/casual restaurant or other small neighborhood-serving uses (i.e. dry cleaners,
florist, real estate office, etc.). The ITE “specialty retail” land use (Land Use Code 826)
is often used as a catch-all for these type of retail sites; however, the trip generation
data for “specialty retail” is based on a very limited sample size. For the purpose of
providing a conservative analysis, ITE’s shopping center land use (Land Use Code 820)
was applied to account for the proposed retail uses, as the data for this use is based on
a larger sample size and reflects a higher peak hour trip generation rate than the
specialty retail land use. Pass-by reductions were applied to the retail trip generation
estimates based on rates in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 3nd Edition.

Traffic generated by the existing sports bar/restaurant, which will be displaced by the
project, was subtracted from traffic generated by the proposed uses. The peak hour
traffic counts collected at the existing site access driveways were collected in a manner
that allowed for the trips associated with the sports bar/restaurant to be isolated from
the trips associated with the existing Windmill Farms produce market, which shares a
parking lot with the sports bar/restaurant. Only the sports bar/restaurant trips were
subtracted from the project trip generation totals. Daily volumes were not collected at
the site access driveways, therefore, the daily trip generation total for the sports
bar/restaurant was estimated based on the observed PM peak hour trip generation and


                                           12                                      February 2016
                                                                        San Ramon Valley Apartments
                                                                   Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report

the ratio of daily to PM peak hour trip generation rates from ITE’s High-Turnover (Sit-
Down) Restaurant land use (Land Use Code 932).

While there are likely to be some internal trips made walking between the residential
uses of this mixed-use project and the ground-floor retail uses (in addition to the
adjacent produce market), no reductions were applied to the trip generation estimates to
account for trip internalization in order to provide a conservative assessment of potential
project-related traffic impacts.

While some trips generated by the project will likely be made by walking, biking or
transit, current non-auto commute mode splits for the City of San Ramon are generally
low5. For this reason, no trip reductions were applied for non-auto mode use in order to
provide a conservative analysis.

The project trip generation totals are summarized in Table 4 below.

 Existing commute mode split for the City of San Ramon includes approximately 3.1% by walking/bicycle

Notes:
(1) Trip Generation Data from ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition, 2012.
(2) Pass-By Percentages are from the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 3rd Edition.
(3) For Retail uses (ITE 820 Shopping Center), PM Pass-by is a function of project size using equation from ITE Trip
Generation Handbook with min pass-by assumed at 34% if land use quantity < 152 KSF. Equation = Ln(T)=-
0.29Ln(X)+5.00
(4) For Retail uses, no Daily pass-by percentage is provided by ITE. Therefore, a Daily pass-by reduction of 15% is
assumed, which is consistent with Caltrans TIA Standards, 2002. No pass-by reduction is assumed for the AM peak
hour.
(5) Trip credit for existing sports bar/restaurant, which will be displaced with construction of the proposed project, based
on traffic counts collected September 2015 at existing site driveways. Driveway counts used for existing trip credits
include existing sports bar/restaurant only--trips from existing produce market were excluded, as this use may remain
with the addition of the proposed project. Daily trip generation data for the sports bar/restaurant was not obtained from
the traffic count data; thus, existing trip generation for the site was estimated based on the ratio of Daily to PM Peak
Hour trips from ITE's High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant land use (ITE Land Use Code 932).

As shown in Table 4, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 842
daily, 92 AM peak hour, and 81 PM peak hour net new vehicle trips.

The proposed project does not include changes in the size or intensity of uses at the
existing Windmill Farms produce market. While the addition of new residential and retail



                                                                   14                                                     February 2016

                                                                     Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report

uses in close proximity to the produce market may increase activity at the site, the trips
to/from these uses are likely to be made by walking. For this reason, it is reasonable to
assume that the vehicular trip generation for the produce market will remain similar to
existing. A total of four (4) AM and 71 PM peak hour trips related to Windmill Farms
were observed based on the existing driveway counts conducted in September 2015.

3.3 Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
The project trip distribution was developed based on distributions prepared in previous
traffic impact analysis reports6, existing traffic patterns, and the general orientation of
population and employment sources to the site. Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the
project trip distribution assumptions for the inbound and outbound directions,
respectively.

The project trips were assigned to the study area street network based on the trip
distribution patterns shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The peak hour project trip
assignment is illustrated in Figure 7. Key assumptions used in the project trip
assignment are summarized as follows:

      l   Project trips were assigned to the two site access driveways based on the
          relative distribution of resident, visitor and retail parking spaces accessed from
          either access driveway. Based on review of the current site plan and project trip
          generation by land use, it appears that approximately 60 percent of project trips
          would enter/exit the project site via the San Ramon Valley Boulevard driveway,
          while the remaining 40 percent would utilize the Deerwood Road driveway.
      l   Because access at both the San Ramon Valley Boulevard and Deerwood Road
          site driveways is limited to right-in/right-out only, it is assumed that U-turn
          maneuvers will be required for drivers to enter the site from certain routes. For
          example, drivers entering the San Ramon Valley Boulevard driveway from
          northbound San Ramon Valley Boulevard are assume to make a U-turn at the
          San Ramon Valley Boulevard/Deerwood Road intersection in order to enter the
          site driveway. Similarly, drivers entering the Deerwood Drive access point from
          the south or east are assumed to make a U-turn from westbound Deerwood
          Drive to eastbound Deerwood Drive at the Old Crow Canyon-Omega Road
          intersection.
      l   For drivers exiting the site via the San Ramon Valley Boulevard driveway with
          intended destinations to the north along San Ramon Valley Boulevard or east
          along Fostoria Way, it was assumed that drivers would make a right-turn
          movement out of the site, then perform a U-turn maneuver at the In-N-Out Burger

       left-turn lane to access northbound San Ramon Valley Boulevard. The total
       number of project trips anticipate to make this maneuver is relatively low (less
       than five peak hour trips).
   l   It is understood that the project applicant is considering the inclusion of an
       additional vehicular connection to San Ramon Valley Boulevard through a “back
       of house” drive aisle along the south side of the Windmill Farms produce market.
       As mentioned previously, this connection was not assumed in this analysis;
       however, detailed discussion of the potential effects on traffic access and
       circulation with consideration for this additional connection is provided later in
       Section 7.4.2 of this report.
Project trip generation, distribution and assignment assumptions were submitted for City
traffic engineering staff for review prior to proceeding with the remaining traffic analysis.

4 EXISTING (2015) PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

4.1 Existing Plus Project Lane Configurations and Traffic
    Control
The proposed project is not anticipated to modify intersection geometrics or traffic
control at any of the study intersections. Thus, the lane geometries and traffic control
types identified in Figure 2 would remain for Existing plus Project conditions.

4.2 Existing Plus Project Peak Hour Intersection Volumes
Project volumes were added to the existing conditions volumes to produce Existing plus
Project traffic conditions. These volumes are shown in Figure 8 for weekday AM and
PM peak hour conditions.

4.3 Existing Plus Project Intersection Operations
Existing plus Project traffic conditions were evaluated at all study intersections. Results
of this analysis are presented in Table 5.

5 CUMULATIVE (2035) CONDITIONS

5.1 Cumulative (2035) Transportation Network
The analysis of Cumulative (2035) Conditions assumes the addition of improvements to
the study area roadway network that are programed, and anticipated to be funded and
constructed by the horizon year identified for this analysis (Year 2035). These
improvements are consistent with the improvements found within the City’s Capital
Improvement Program for the fiscal years 2015 through 2020, and as identified in other
traffic impact studies prepared recently in this area. The following pertinent roadway
improvements were confirmed with City of San Ramon staff for inclusion in the
Cumulative (2035) Conditions analysis for this study:

   l   Twin Creeks Drive Extension – Extend Twin Creeks Drive from Crow Canyon
       Road north to Old Crow Canyon Road and implement intersection improvements
       at the Crow Canyon Road/Twin Creeks Drive intersection;
   l   Crow Canyon Road/I-680 Southbound Ramps Intersection Improvements –
       Widen southbound approach to add a third southbound left-turn lane;
   l   Crow Canyon Road/I-680 Northbound Ramps Intersection Improvements –
       Widen northbound approach to provide an additional dedicated right-turn lane;
   l   San Ramon Valley Boulevard/Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way Intersection
       Improvements – Implement capacity improvements to provide dual northbound
       left-turn lanes and lengthen existing northbound and eastbound left-turn pockets
       to provide additional vehicle storage. The southbound left-turn lane into the
       northernmost In-N-Out Burger driveway is anticipated to be removed to allow
       extension of the northbound left-turn pocket storage (required as part of Faria
       Preserve project);
   l   Deerwood Road/Old Crow Canyon/Omega Road – Install traffic signal, with
       permitted left-turn phasing for northbound/southbound approaches and protected
       left-turn phasing for eastbound/westbound approaches (required as part of Faria
       Preserve project);
   l   Purdue Road Extension and Signal Installation – Install traffic signal at
       Purdue Road/San Ramon Valley Boulevard and extend Purdue Road westerly
       from Omega Drive to connect to the future Faria Preserve Parkway (required as
       part of Faria Preserve project); and
   l   Faria Preserve Parkway – Construct a new two-lane roadway extending
       approximately 5,300 feet west from the Purdue Road Extension through the

5.2 Planned and Proposed Development Projects in Vicinity
    of Site
There are several development projects in the vicinity of the proposed project site in
various stages of planning approval or development. These projects will ultimately be
developed roughly the same time as the proposed San Ramon Valley Apartments
project. The following list of nearby approved and pending projects was obtained from
the City of San Ramon7:

5.2.1 Crow Canyon Specific Plan Development Context
As mentioned previously, the proposed project is located within the Crow Canyon
Specific Plan (CCSP) Area. The CCSP provides a vision for the long-term development
of the 128-acre area of the City generally bound by I-680 to the east, Crow Canyon
Road to the south, the San Ramon City limit to the north and west. The CCSP provides
a blueprint to guide land use and infrastructure investment with the goal of creating a
pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use community that includes concentrated commercial and
residential uses, while maintaining viable light industrial and commercial uses that exist
today and wish to remain.

The proposed project is within a zone of the “Core” subarea of the CCSP, and is
designated for “Village Center Mixed-Use”, which intends to promote the creation of a
mixed-use and pedestrian-scaled activity center at the heart of the plan area. The
CCSP development program proposes approximately 580 net new residential units and
154,000 net new square feet of commercial space within the Core subarea. The
proposed project is understood to be consistent with the land use plan considered for

  this portion of the plan area and represents a portion of the total anticipated growth
  within this CCSP Core subarea. Consistent with requirements set forth in the City of
  San Ramon General Plan 2020 (Adopted, 2001), a trip budget has been established for
  the CCSP Area. Development exceeding the traffic levels evaluated in the General Plan
  EIR could potentially cause greater traffic impacts and negate the adopted mitigation
  measures; therefore, development in the CCSP area cannot collectively exceed the
  established trip budget. New development projects consistent with the CCSP can be
  allowed as long as the cumulative trip generation remains under the trip budget.

  The trip generation for the proposed project was considered along with other approved
  and pending development projects identified within the CCSP area boundary as of
  September 2015. Table 6 below summarizes the trip generation for these development
  projects compared to the established trip budget for the plan area.

  As shown in Table 6, the cumulative development trip generation from currently
  planned/pending projects within the plan area—including the proposed project—
  remains well below the established trip budget.

 5.3 Cumulative (2035) Conditions Peak Hour Intersection
     Volumes
  Cumulative (2035) Conditions AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are based on
  future year traffic forecasts obtained from the CCTA Travel Demand Forecast model.
  The 2035 projection represents a long-term forecast of traffic levels expected to occur at
  buildout of the City of San Ramon General Plan and growth in the surrounding vicinity
  through Year 2035.

  The model was used to plot bi-directional peak hour traffic volumes on each segment of
  the roadways in the study area for the model base year (2013) and horizon year (2035)



                                                   20                                           February 2016

scenarios. Model output was used to compare the base year and horizon year model
forecasts to determine the incremental difference in traffic volumes at study
intersections. If volumes from the CCTA model showed a decrease for a particular link,
the decrease in volume was conservatively overridden to not have any negative growth.

Year 2035 turning movement volumes were calculated by adding the weighted
incremental difference in bi-directional roadway segment (i.e., link) volumes to the
existing 2015 link volumes to essentially reflect 20 years of growth. The projected
approach and departure volumes and existing intersection turning movement volumes
were used to generate Cumulative (2035) Conditions intersection turning movement
volumes using a process known as “Furnessing”. With the Furness process, the
projected 2035 approach and departure link volumes are converted into initial turning
movement volumes by approach based on existing turning movement distributions, then
adjusted through several iterations until the existing approach volumes are in
agreement with the departing volume distributions.

Based on review of the CCTA travel demand forecasting model land use files, it was
determined that the housing and employment growth assumed within the model traffic
analysis zone (TAZ) that the proposed project is located within is generally consistent
with the development anticipated within this area as part of the CCSP and already
includes growth representative of the proposed project. For this reason, the Year 2035
intersection-level peak hour traffic volumes developed based on the CCTA model
projections were assumed to reflect Cumulative (2035) plus Project traffic levels.

Cumulative (2035) Conditions traffic volumes without the proposed project were
developed by subtracting the net new project trips (as summarized in Table 4 and
Figure 7) from the Cumulative (2035) plus Project intersection volumes.

Cumulative (2035) Conditions peak hour intersection volumes without the proposed
project are summarized in Figure 10.

Additional information from the CCTA Travel Demand Forecast Model are provided in
Appendix F.

5.4 Cumulative (2035) Conditions Intersection Operations
Traffic operations were evaluated for Cumulative (2035) Conditions without the
proposed project at the study intersections. Results of this analysis are presented in
Table 7.

Detailed Cumulative (2035) intersection operations analysis worksheets are provided in
Appendix D.

6 CUMULATIVE (2035) PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

6.1 Cumulative (2035) Plus Project Lane Configurations and
    Traffic Control
The proposed project is not anticipated to modify intersection geometrics or traffic
control at any of the study intersections. Thus, the Cumulative (2035) Conditions lane
geometries and traffic control types identified in Figure 9 would remain for Cumulative
(2035) plus Project conditions.

  6.2 Cumulative (2035) Plus Project Peak Hour Intersection
      Volumes
     As discussed in the Cumulative (2035) Conditions section of this report, Year 2035
     traffic volumes were developed based on traffic projections from the CCTA Travel
     Demand Forecast Model. Since the proposed project was understood to be represented
     within the land use growth included in the 2035 travel demand model land use files, the
     volumes that were calculated based on the model traffic projections were representative
     of Cumulative (2035) plus Project volumes. Peak hour intersection volumes for
     Cumulative (2035) plus Project Conditions are summarized in Figure 11.

  6.3 Cumulative (2035) Plus Project Intersection Operations
     Cumulative (2035) plus Project traffic conditions were evaluated at all study

As shown in Table 8, all study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service.


7 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

7.1 Vehicle Queuing at Intersections
As congestion increases, it is common for traffic at signals and stop signs to form lines
of stopped (or queued) vehicles. Intersection approach queue lengths were calculated
at left- and right-turn pockets for each study intersection using SYNCHRO software all
analysis scenarios and compared to the provided turn pocket storage lengths to
evaluate the potential for queues to spill back and impede through traffic. The 95th
percentile queue is calculated by using the 95th percentile traffic volume to account for
fluctuations in traffic and represents a condition where 95 percent of the time during the
peak period, traffic volumes and related queuing will be at, or less, than determined by
the analysis. The 95th percentile queue is used as the benchmark for queuing impacts
as a standard transportation engineering practice. Average queuing is generally less. A
typical vehicle length of 25 feet is assumed in the queuing analysis. Projected queues
were evaluated to identify potential locations where projected queues exceed the
storage limits of the provided turn pockets by at least one vehicle length (i.e. 25 feet). A
summary of the queuing results is included in Appendix G.

As seen in the summary, queuing exceeds the turn bay length at several intersections
under Existing plus Project conditions and Cumulative (2035) plus Project conditions.
However, in most cases the inadequate turn bays are not associated with the proposed
project but are a result of pre-existing deficiencies. At locations which are at or near
capacity and affected by project traffic, the increase in vehicle queuing is less than one
vehicle, except at the following intersections:

   ·   #1 – Crow Canyon Road and San Ramon Valley Boulevard (Southbound Left
       Turn Pocket):
          o During the AM peak hour in Cumulative (2035) plus Project
             Conditions, the total queue length is 319 feet, 69 feet longer than the turn
             pocket length. The project is responsible for 58 feet of the total queue,
             which is equivalent to approximately two (2) vehicles.
   ·   #6 – San Ramon Valley Boulevard and Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way
       (Northbound Left Turn Pocket):
          o During the PM peak hour in Existing plus Project Conditions, the total
             queue length is 440 feet, 330 feet longer than the turn pocket length. The
             project is responsible for 103 feet of the total queue, which is equivalent to
             approximately four (4) vehicles.

It should be noted that queuing impact at intersection #1 does not meet the significance
criteria for queues which is if the project increases the queue by three car lengths or




                                          24                                      February 2016

more. Mitigation measures for the queuing impact at intersection #6, which does meet
the significance criteria, are discussed later in Section 8.1.3 of this report.

7.2 Traffic Signal Warrants
A planning-level assessment of the need for traffic signalization was performed at the
intersection of Old Crow Canyon Road/Deerwood Road/Omega Road using Warrant 3
(Peak Hour) from the 2014 CAMUTCD. This assessment found that the peak-hour
warrant was not satisfied in the AM and PM peak hour for Existing and Existing plus
Project conditions. Analysis sheets are provided in Appendix H.

An assessment was not performed for Cumulative (2035) Conditions, as the intersection
is planned to be signalized as part of the City of San Ramon’s Capital Improvement
Program.

7.3 Potential Effects on Pedestrian, Bicycle and Pedestrian
    Mobility
The proposed project was evaluated to determine if it would likely conflict with adopted
policies, plans, or programs supporting alternative transportation (e.g., bus turnouts,
bicycle racks) or generate pedestrian, bicycle, or transit travel demand that would not be
accommodated by transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities and plans.

Residents, visitors, retail employees and customers at the proposed project have the
option of driving, taking transit, walking or bicycling. For those taking transit, they can
reach the site via County Connection Routes 21, 36, 92X, and 95X.

For Route 21, the nearest transit stops (northbound and southbound) are located along
San Ramon Valley Boulevard just north of Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way. These stops
can be accessed by the paved sidewalks along San Ramon Valley Boulevard and
Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way. Route 95X also has a stop within short walking distance
at the southeast corner of the Fostoria Way/Crow Canyon Place intersection. These
routes link with additional local and regional transit connections at the San Ramon
Transit Center and Walnut Creek BART Station.

According to current census data8, 5.6% of San Ramon residents use transit to travel to
work. This typically represents the highest level of transit ridership during the day, with
other periods being lower such as when shoppers commonly travel to the store. If it is
conservatively assumed that 5.6% of all trips associated with the proposed project will
use transit during the peak hours of the day, it represents approximately six (6)
additional passengers in the weekday AM peak hour period, and five (5) additional
passengers in the weekday PM peak hour period. Data was not readily available for

                                                                   San Ramon Valley Apartments

peak hour ridership levels on the County Connection system, but during the weekday
periods, the routes operate every 30 to 60 minutes. Furthermore, dispersion of the
project-generated riders to the bus routes would result in a minimal effect on transit
capacity. Thus the project impact on transit service is determined to be less than
significant.

Current census data suggests that even fewer San Ramon residents or workers are
anticipated to walk or bicycle for commute purposes than will ride transit. Existing
commute mode spits for San Ramon indicate that about three (3) percent of residents
commute to work by walking or bicycling.

Cyclists will be able to use the Class II bike lanes located on Deerwood Road and San
Ramon Valley Boulevard. A Class III bike route is located along Deerwood Drive west of
the proposed project. These bicycle facilities provide connectivity to other existing
bicycle facilities within the study area, including the Iron Horse Trail Class I bicycle path,
which can be accessed at Fostoria Way just east of Camino Ramon. The current site
plan indicates that the proposed project will provide a total of 31 on-site bicycle parking
spaces: a rack with five (5) bicycle parking spaces will be located at the corner retail site
and an additional 26 bicycle parking spaces will be located in the residential garage.

While the proposed project is not anticipated to have a significant impact on bicycle
circulation within the study area, the following improvements are suggested to provide
enhanced bicycle safety at site access driveways:

   l   Add green colored pavement markings within the bicycle lanes on Deerwood
       Road and San Ramon Valley Boulevard along the segments fronting the project
       access driveways. Colored pavement within a bicycle lane increases the visibility
       of the facilities, identifies potential areas of conflict, and reinforces priority to
       bicyclists in areas where vehicles cross the bicycle lane when accessing
       driveways.
There appear to be adequate pedestrian walkways from the project site to the existing
sidewalks on San Ramon Valley Boulevard and Deerwood Road. This will allow
proposed project residents, visitors and retail employees and patrons to conveniently
walk from nearby destinations or access transit services. Pedestrian crosswalks, signal
heads and push buttons are present on approaches at signalized intersections near the
project site.

The project will construct necessary on-site sidewalks, walkways, bicycle parking, and
other amenities in compliance with adopted policies, plans and programs; thus, the
project’s impact on transit, pedestrian or bicycle facilities is determined to be less than
significant.

                                                             Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report


7.4 Site Access and Circulation
The project’s site access and circulation are shown in the site plan, as referenced in
Figure 4. Access to the project site would be provided via two unsignalized right-
in/right-out only driveways: one on Deerwood Road and one on San Ramon Valley
Boulevard. Both driveways are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service, and
neither intersection meets MUTCD peak hour warrants for signalization. Based on the
current site plan, both site driveways would provide throat depths with sufficient length
to accommodate queues of approximately two vehicle lengths (about 40-45 feet). A
queuing analysis for each driveway indicated that the 95 th percentile queues would be
no greater than one (1) vehicle for all project scenarios.

Based on review of the site plan, all project driveways measure 20 feet in width or
greater, which is consistent with applicable design standards. The project site appears
to provide ample circulation aisles and a layout that is generally consistent with driver
expectations.

A service area for panel truck and trash/recycling truck access will be provided at the
northwest corner of the project site. The driveway provides right-in/right-out access
from Deerwood Road with a 24-foot aisle width and 30-foot throat depth. With this
configuration, service trucks will be required to encroach into the outside travel lane on
Deerwood Road when backing into or out of this drive aisle. To reduce potential for
vehicle conflicts at this point, it is recommended that a right-turn/access pullout be
provided along Deerwood Road approaching the service driveway and extending to the
resident vehicle driveway just east of the service driveway. The property lines at the
project site and the adjacent private property are set back at least 20 feet from the
existing curb, providing enough public right of way to accommodate this improvement.

Sight distances, emergency access, truck access, and on-site circulation planned for
the project appear to be generally adequate, and would be subject to refinements as
part of the design review process.

7.4.1 Analysis of Deerwood Road Gate Access
As discussed previously, the Deerwood Road site access driveway will provide gate-
controlled access to the upper level of the on-site parking garage, which includes
approximately 130 resident parking spaces, including 24 tandem spaces (about 47
percent of the total on-site apartment resident and guest parking). Based on review of
the current site plan, the entry driveway can accommodate approximately two (2)
vehicles, including the service position at the gate, without spilling back into the traffic
lane on Deerwood Road. The queue storage provided at the driveway was analyzed in
order to evaluate the potential for vehicles entering the gated driveway to spill back onto
Deerwood Road.

The methodology outlined in Parking Structures 3rd Edition: Planning, Design,
Construction, Maintenance, and Repair (Anthony P. Chrest, et. al., 2001) was utilized to


                                          27                                      February 2016
                                                                  San Ramon Valley Apartments
                                                             Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report

perform a queuing analysis for the entry gate. Although the original methodology was
developed for parking garage entry gates, the same fundamentals apply to gated
residential communities.

Based on the trip generation analysis conducted for the proposed project (see Table 4),
the peak inbound trip generation for the residential component of the project would be
68 inbound trips during the PM peak hour. The peak hourly trips entering the Deerwood
Road driveway would be about 31. For the purposes of this analysis, a peak hour factor
of 0.80 was applied to this volume to establish a conservative peak inbound demand of
39 vehicles per hour.

Residents entering the facility are anticipated to gain access via proximity card reader
and/or access code. Based on typical service rates for various parking access control
types, as presented in Parking Structures 3rd Edition, an average service rate of 600
vehicles per hour is reasonable to assume for this type of gate control. To provide a
conservative analysis, a design service rate taken as 80 percent of the average rate—
522 vehicles per hour—was assumed for this assessment.

In order to estimate the queue length, a traffic intensity ratio was calculated. Traffic
intensity is defined as the hourly arrival rate divided by the hourly service rate. For the
resident entry at Deerwood Road, the traffic intensity ratio calculated to be 0.075. The
traffic intensity factor was plotted on a single-channel queue curve, which assumes
random arrivals (Poisson distribution) to determine the 90 th percentile design queue.
The 90th percentile queue represents a value where 90 percent of the observed vehicle
queues during the design hour would be equal or less and is a common metric used on
parking facility design.

The 90th percentile queue length for the resident entry gate is less than one (1) vehicle
behind the service position, while the site plan provides for approximately two (2)
vehicles behind the service position. Therefore, the currently proposed site plan is
projected to accommodate resident queues accessing the site without impacting
Deerwood Road.

7.4.2 Potential for Additional Back of House Connection
As discussed previously, the project applicant is considering a subsequent project
phase that would include an upgrade to the Windmill Farms facility and a new “back of
house” connection to the adjacent property to the south. The addition of this connection
would modify the access assumptions for the proposed project. There is no raised
median along San Ramon Valley Boulevard at the site driveway for the adjacent
property to the south; thus, left-turn movements are anticipated to be allowed for traffic
entering and egressing this site. This additional connection has not been approved at
this point and has not been assumed in the project traffic analysis presented thus far in
order to provide a conservative assessment of off-site traffic impacts. Without this
additional connection, vehicles are required to perform additional U-turn maneuvers at
nearby intersections to ingress and egress the site to/from certain directions. With the


                                          28                                      February 2016
                                                                     San Ramon Valley Apartments
                                                                Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report

addition of this “back of house” connection, it is likely that some drivers will use the
driveway at the adjacent property to the south in order to make left-turn movements to
and from San Ramon Valley Boulevard, which will reduce the number of circuitous U-
turn maneuvers at off-site intersections, such as San Ramon Valley
Boulevard/Deerwood Road, Deerwood Road/Old Crow Canyon, and San Ramon Valley
Boulevard/In-N-Out Driveway, which is likely to improve traffic operations at those
locations.

Without detailed traffic data for the proposed sushi restaurant and existing pet clinic at
the adjacent parcel to the south of the proposed project, it is difficult to estimate the
traffic volumes that will ultimately use the driveway to this parcel. Thus, it is difficult to
perform a detailed evaluation of traffic operations at this driveway intersection. A
focused evaluation of access and circulation at this driveway should be performed as
part of the traffic impact study for the proposed restaurant development within this
parcel.



8 SUMMARY OF IMPACTS AND RECOMMENDED
  MITIGATION
Based on the results of the traffic analysis and evaluation of the proposed site plan the
following impacts are noted.

8.1 Existing Plus Project

8.1.1 Traffic
All intersections operate acceptably (LOS D or better) in Existing plus Project
Conditions during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, no mitigation measures for
traffic conditions are required.

8.1.2 Pedestrian, Bicycle and Transit
The project would not have a significant impact on existing transit facilities or
operations, and is not anticipate to generate additional transit demand that cannot
reasonably be accommodated by existing services. The project would not significantly
impact existing or planned pedestrian and bicycle facilities and sufficient on-site
pedestrian connections and bicycle parking are anticipated to be provided. Therefore,
no mitigation measures for pedestrian, bicycle and transit are required.

8.1.3 Queuing
The proposed project is anticipated to exacerbate queuing issues at the northbound left-
turn movement at the San Ramon Valley Boulevard/Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way


                                            29                                       February 2016
                                                                 San Ramon Valley Apartments
                                                            Final Traffic Impact Analysis Report

intersection. For Existing plus Project Conditions during the PM peak hour, the
northbound left-turn movement is projected to have a 95 th percentile queue of 440, 330
feet longer than the provided turn pocket length. The proposed project is responsible for
103 feet of the total queue, or about four (4) vehicles.

The following mitigation measure is recommended to mitigate queuing impacts at the
intersection of San Ramon Valley Boulevard/Deerwood Road/Fostoria Way for Existing
plus Project Conditions:

   l   Implement the planned intersection improvements to construct a second
       northbound left-turn lane and extend the northbound left-turn pocket to provide
       additional storage. This improvement is already required as a condition of
       approval for the Faria Preserve development project.

8.1.4 Site Access and Circulation
The project is not anticipated to have a significant impact on site access and circulation,
since access to and from the project site, as well as internal circulation, are sufficient.
While the project does not result in any significant impacts, the following improvements
are recommended to improve site access and reduce potential for vehicle conflicts
along the site frontage:

   l   Construct a right-turn lane/service vehicle access pullout along eastbound
       Deerwood Road approaching the site trash/service driveway and extending to
       the resident vehicle driveway. This lane allows vehicles entering the resident
       driveway to decelerate outside of the through lane on Deerwood Road, and
       provides an area for trash/service trucks to enter and exit the service driveway
       without encroaching into the adjacent travel lane.

8.2 Cumulative (2035) Plus Project

8.2.1 Traffic
All intersections operate acceptably (LOS D or better) in Cumulative (2035) plus Project
Conditions during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, no mitigation measures for
traffic conditions are required.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
The City of Lake Oswego is updating its Transportation System Plan (TSP) to ensure the city’s
Comprehensive Plan is coordinated with other plans and in compliance with statewide goals and statutes.
As part of the City’s “periodic review” of its Comprehensive Plan, the TSP will meet the requirements of
the Transportation Planning Rule (TPR), the Oregon Transportation Plan and the Regional Transportation
Functional Plan (RTFP), and be consistent with 2008 ODOT Transportation System Planning Guidelines.
The updated TSP will support the update of Lake Oswego’s Comprehensive Plan currently underway, and
address the Lake Oswego Community Vision for 2035. The project is intended to be completed in the
spring of 2013, allowing the TSP updates element of the Comprehensive Plan to be adopted with the
updated Comprehensive Plan.

The purpose of the TSP is to provide a safe, convenient and economical network of transportation
facilities to support a variety of travel choices. It guides the development of transportation facilities and
services to ensure they are adequate to meet the needs of planned land uses. The TSP will do the
following:

           Establish an efficient network of arterials/collectors
           Include standards for the layout, spacing and connectivity of local streets
           Protect facilities and corridors for intended uses
           Provide a public transportation plan to meet basic needs
           Establish a network of sidewalks and bikeways linking residential areas to activity centers
           Propose a finance program that is reasonably likely
           Include implementing code and ordinances

March 7, 2012                                                                                                     Page 2


OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
           1. Design and manage a convenient and transparent process that invites meaningful public
              involvement using a range of strategies that are efficient and effective.
           2. Build consensus and ensure that transportation system and policies effectively address the
              Community Vision, goal statements and the expectations of local agencies, private
              stakeholders and community members.
           3. Coordinate with overall Comprehensive Plan public involvement efforts.

        Lake Oswego Police Department
As needed, the City may schedule additional meetings or create additional ad hoc stakeholder groups to
address specific issues.

City staff will be responsible for meeting logistics, providing copies of meeting materials and preparing
meetings summaries. The consultant will be responsible for preparing agendas and other relevant
materials and facilitating meetings of the PAC/TAC.


Public Outreach Materials
The public involvement program will use a variety of public outreach materials to keep the public
informed on TSP update issues and progress. Public outreach tools may include:

               Email
               Fact sheets
               Flyers
               “Hello LO” Newsletter
               Media Releases
                “We Love LO” website
The City will provide content for public outreach materials. The consultant will review, revise content and
prepare graphic layouts for up to three public involvement outreach materials. This includes one draft
and one final review for each product. The City may use consultant-prepared materials as templates for
future materials.


Public Events

                draft TSP
City and consultant staff will jointly develop timelines, agendas and materials for the public events. The
City will plan and conduct the public events, and collect, compile and report the input gathered. The City
also will print all maps, graphics and other meeting materials. The consultant will participate in the public
event and provide up to twenty (20) hours of technical support including the development of maps and
graphics.


Project Briefings
The public involvement plan includes up to six (6) meetings with the City Council, Planning Commission,
and/or Comprehensive Plan Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to provide briefings on the TSP and/or
support the adoption process. Each briefing will last no more than two (2) hours and will utilize materials
prepared for the PAC. The City will handle logistics and provide copies of all materials for the briefings.
Only the Consultant Project Manager will attend unless otherwise approved by the City Project Manager.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Lake Oswego’s Transportation System Plan (TSP) must comply with state requirements in Oregon
Administrative Rule Division 12, Transportation Planning, known as the Transportation Planning Rule
(TPR). The City’s TSP also must comply with the regional planning requirements of Metro, primarily the
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and Regional Transportation Functional Plan (RTFP).3

In this memorandum, two icons are used to help identify mandated compliance issues versus required or
suggested coordination issues:

       Compliance requirement

       Coordination requirement or opportunity

Key findings are summarized below.

      1. Much of the existing Comprehensive Plan is in compliance with state and regional requirements.
         To fully comply, Lake Oswego will need to:

         a. Adopt the updated TSP as part of the Comprehensive Plan – The current TSP is not explicitly
             identified as an adopted part of Lake Oswego’s Comprehensive Plan. On a practical level, it is
             clear that the TSP is functionally a part of the Comprehensive Plan and its implementation.
             However, the TSP update should include a clear policy and adoption finding that states that
             the TSP is part of the Comprehensive Plan.
         b. Coordinate the timing of the TSP adoption and Comprehensive Plan amendments – At some
             point, the City will need to make a determination regarding the specific TSP-related
             Comprehensive Plan amendments it intends to place into an ordinance and take through the
             adoption process. Initial options are: (1) Adopt the TSP as an integrated part of the new,
             updated Comprehensive Plan; and (2) Adopt the TSP as an amendment to the City’s existing
             Comprehensive Plan and then integrate it into the full new Comprehensive Plan during
             subsequent Comprehensive Plan adoption proceedings.
         c. Coordinate further with the state on compliance with TPR Section 060 – Recent amendments
            to the TPR address what is required when amendments to functional plans, Comprehensive
             Plans, and Transportation System Plans are proposed. When Lake Oswego’s TSP update is
             completed, it will be adopted through amendments to the TSP, Comprehensive Plan, and
             Code. Procedurally, the City already complies with Section 060 because it requires such


3
    The TPR, RTP, and RTFP are the principal state and regional documents the Lake Oswego TSP must comply with.
There are other state and regional plans, policies and regulations which are also applicable. Please see the
“Compliance Summary” section of this memorandum for a list of state and regional documents reviewed.
City of Lake Oswego Transportation System Plan Update                                             Project #: 11187
March 7, 2012                                                                                               Page 3


               amendments to comply with the Statewide Planning Goals and Oregon Administrative Rules.
               Substantive amendments being considered in the TSP should be tested for compliance with
               TPR Section 060 throughout the TSP process, in coordination with the state.4

       2. The 1997 TSP was fully compliant with state and regional requirements when it was adopted, and
          was very forward-looking regarding transportation policy. Many requirements have obviously
          changed since 1997. Notably, Metro’s regional planning program and requirements are much
          more comprehensive today. Lake Oswego should consider the following during the TSP update to
          meet current regulations:

          a. Review the classification of Highway 43 with ODOT – The TSP process should coordinate with
              ODOT on the state’s classification of Highway 43, which changes from a District Highway north
              of A Street to a Statewide Highway south of A Street. Lake Oswego’s Town Center
              encompasses all of the downtown and State Street. From a land use perspective, a consistent
              highway classification may be more appropriate.
          b. Integrate the Special Transportation Area designation of State Street into the TSP – State
              Street is a designated a Special Transportation Area (STA). STAs are, in part, how the state
              recognizes the importance of Oregon’s downtowns. Lake Oswego’s STA is not mentioned in
              the current TSP or the Community Development Code. The TSP update process should
              explore how this designation can benefit Lake Oswego’s transportation system and goals for
              the downtown. The STA must be explicitly recognized in the TSP.
          c. Incorporate current state mobility standards for Highway 43 – The current TSP (1997) is based
              on out-of-date standards. The TSP’s technical analysis will need to utilize the Oregon Highway
              Plan’s (OHP) current mobility policy and “Table 7” standards for Highway 43. The new
              standards and policy framework in OHP Policy 1F provide the City with more flexibility to plan
              mixed use centers, and integrate land use, economic development, and transportation than
              previous state mobility standards.
          d. Coordinate with Metro on regional High Capacity Transit (HCT) corridors – The TSP update
              should include coordination with Metro concerning Lake Oswego’s obligations regarding the
             Regional HTC System Plan.5 At minimum, the TSP should describe the Regional HCT System
              Plan’s recommendations for the east-west corridor through Lake Oswego. The Transit Plan
              component of the TSP should examine the corridors, and reference future planning to be
              conducted.
          e. Integrate the RTP’s recommendations for all modes – The new RTP (June, 2010) provides a
              completely updated regional backdrop for Lake Oswego’s TSP as compared to 1997. The TSP
             will need to address recommendations for regional street design classifications, bicycle
              designations, pedestrian network designations, and mobility corridors. The Regional Trails
              Map should be part of this integration.


4
    The finding applies to the Comprehensive Plan as well.

         f.   Comply with current TPR standards – Detailed TPR requirements are identified in this
               memorandum – please see Tables 1-3 in Appendix A. Standards to be addressed range from
               performance standards to pedestrian districts.

    3. Only minor updates to Lake Oswego’s Community Development Code are needed to comply with
        the TPR and Metro’s RTFP. These include updates that address pedestrian and bicycle circulation
        (off-site standards), “safe and convenient” pedestrian routes, transit route definitions, potential
        wider application of carpool and vanpool standards, transportation demand management, parking
        structures, and updated street standards.

COMPLIANCE SUMMARY
Transportation system planning in Oregon is required by state law as one of the 19 statewide planning
goals (Goal 12, Transportation). The following state and regional plans and policies have been reviewed
to determine the City’s compliance with state and regional requirements:

State Plans and Regulations

              Transportation Planning Rule (OAR 660-012)
              1992 Oregon Transportation Plan (updated 1999, 2006)
              1999 Oregon Highway Plan (updated 2006)
              2010 – 2013 State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP)
              Access Management Rules (OAR 734-051)
              State and Regional Climate Change Plans and Regulations
Regional Plans and Policies

              Metro Regional Framework Plan
              Metro 2040 Growth Concept
              Metro Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP)
              Metro 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
              Metro Regional Transportation Functional Plan (RTFP)
              Regional High Capacity Transit Plan, 2035 Summary Report
              TriMet Transit Investment Plan
              Regional Trails
              Checklist for Local Compliance in TSP (from Transportation and Implementation Guidance for
               the Portland Metropolitan Region)
The findings from the review of the above-listed documents are summarized below in the form of
“comments and potential amendments”. These findings are grouped according to the Comprehensive
Plan, TSP, and Community Development Code. Please note:


              This is intended as a starting point for further refinement and use during the TSP update.
              The City’s review of local plans, policies, and regulations will likely reveal local compliance that

LAKE OSWEGO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
Much of the existing Comprehensive Plan is in compliance with state and regional requirements. The
following are comments and potential amendments for the Comprehensive Plan.

TPR 660-012-0015              Adopt the TSP as part of the Comprehensive Plan – The current TSP is not
                             explicitly identified as an adopted part of Lake Oswego’s Comprehensive Plan. The
                              TSP, Chapter 12 of the Comprehensive Plan, and the TSP’s adoption ordinance also
                              do not explicitly state the relationship between the TSP and Comprehensive Plan.
                              On a practical level, it is clear that the TSP is functionally a part of the
                              Comprehensive Plan and its implementation. The TSP update should include a
                              clear policy and adoption finding that states that the TSP is part of the
                              Comprehensive Plan.
TPR 660-012-0015              Coordinate the timing of the TSP adoption and Comprehensive Plan amendments
                             – Lake Oswego is in the process of updating its Comprehensive Plan. The
                              schedules for the TSP and Comprehensive Plan are being coordinated so that both
                              planning efforts are mutually supportive and inform each other. At some point,
                              the City will need to make a determination regarding the specific TSP-related
                              Comprehensive Plan amendment it intends to place into an ordinance and take
                              through the amendment process. Initial options are:

                                   1. Adopt the TSP as an integrated part of the new, updated Comprehensive
                                      Plan.
                                   2. Adopt the TSP as an amendment to the City’s existing Comprehensive
                                      Plan, and then integrate it into the full new Comprehensive Plan during
                                      those proceedings.

                              There may be additional options to consider as this issue is discussed and the City
                              moves closer to completion of the new Comprehensive Plan. The determination of
                              the nature of the TSP adoption should be made as early as possible in the TSP
                              process so it is clear for all participants.

                              of the Code. Procedurally, the City already complies with Section 060 because the
                              Code requires legislative amendments to comply with applicable state law,
                              Statewide Planning Goals, and Oregon Administrative Rules (CDC 50.75.010).
                              Quasi-judicial amendments (e.g. site specific zone changes), do not have this same
                              requirement, but the City has broad authority to require quasi-judicial
                              amendments to comply with “any additional statutory or Lake Oswego code
                              provisions…(CDC 50.79.035, Major Development Review Criteria). The City should
                              consider revising the Major Development Review criteria to be more explicit about
                              compliance with applicable Statewide Planning Goals and Oregon Administrative
                              Rules.
                              The above comments address procedures and criteria. Substantive amendments
                              being considered in the TSP update process should be tested for compliance with
                              TPR Section 060 as early as possible, in coordination with the state.6 The recent
                              amendments to the TPR should be analyzed in detail for what, if anything, they
                              mean for both the emerging Comprehensive Plan and the TSP update. This is not a
                              compliance issue for the existing TSP, but rather a future compliance issue as the
                              Comprehensive Plan and TSP are crafted. As just one example, the TPR’s new
                              sections describing “multi-modal mixed use areas” are complex and need analysis
                              as to whether they will be beneficial to Comprehensive Plan concepts under
                              discussion for mixed use centers and economic vitality.

State Highway                  Highway north of A Street to Statewide Highway south of A Street. Lake
Classification                 Oswego’s Town Center encompasses all of the downtown and State Street.
System                         From a land use perspective, a consistent highway classification may be more
                              appropriate.
                               National Highway System – The TSP process should coordinate with
                               ODOT on the significance of the NHS designations in Lake Oswego and
                               what they mean for decisions to be made in the TSP.
OHP, Policy 1B -               Special Transportation Area along State Street – State Street is a designated a
Land Use and                   Special Transportation Area (STA). STAs are, in part, how the state recognizes the
Transportation                 importance of Oregon’s downtowns. Lake Oswego’s STA is not mentioned in the
                               current TSP or the Community Development Code. The TSP update process

                               should explore how this designation can benefit Lake Oswego’s transportation
                               system and goals for the downtown. The STA must be explicitly recognized in the
                               TSP.

 Table 3: TPR Review: Plan and Land Use Regulations Amendments
OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
(1) If an amendment to a functional plan, an acknowledged
comprehensive plan, or a land use regulation (including a zoning map)
would significantly affect an existing or planned transportation facility,
then the local government must put in place measures as provided in
section (2) of this rule, unless the amendment is allowed under section
(3), (9) or (10) of this rule. A plan or land use regulation amendment
significantly affects a transportation facility if it would:
    (a) Change the functional classification of an existing or planned
    transportation facility (exclusive of correction of map errors in an
    adopted plan);
    (b) Change standards implementing a functional classification system;
    or
     (c) Result in any of the effects listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of
    this subsection based on projected conditions measured at the end of
    the planning period identified in the adopted TSP. As part of evaluating
    projected conditions, the amount of traffic projected to be generated
    within the area of the amendment may be reduced if the amendment
    includes an enforceable, ongoing requirement that would
    demonstrably limit traffic generation, including, but not limited to,
    transportation demand management. This reduction may diminish or
    completely eliminate the significant effect of the amendment.

       (A) Types or levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the
       functional classification of an existing or planned transportation
       facility;

       (B) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned
       transportation facility such that it would not meet the
       performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive
       plan; or

         (C) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned
         transportation facility that is otherwise projected to not meet the
         performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive
         plan.
(2) If a local government determines that there would be a significant
effect, then the local government must ensure that allowed land uses are
consistent with the identified function, capacity, and performance
standards of the facility measured at the end of the planning period
identified in the adopted TSP through one or a combination of the
remedies listed in (a) through (e) below, unless the amendment meets the
balancing test in subsection (2)(e) of this section or qualifies for partial
mitigation in section (11) of this rule. A local government using subsection
(2)(e), section (3), section (10) or section (11) to approve an amendment
recognizes that additional motor vehicle traffic congestion may result and
that other facility providers would not be expected to provide additional
capacity for motor vehicles in response to this congestion.
    (a) Adopting measures that demonstrate allowed land uses are
    consistent with the planned function, capacity, and performance
    standards of the transportation facility.

OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
    (b) Amending the TSP or comprehensive plan to provide transportation
    facilities, improvements or services adequate to support the proposed
    land uses consistent with the requirements of this division; such
    amendments shall include a funding plan or mechanism consistent
    with section (4) or include an amendment to the transportation
    finance plan so that the facility, improvement, or service will be
    provided by the end of the planning period.
    (c) Amending the TSP to modify the planned function, capacity or
    performance standards of the transportation facility.
    (d) Providing other measures as a condition of development or
    through a development agreement or similar funding method,
    including, but not limited to, transportation system management
    measures or minor transportation improvements. Local governments
    shall, as part of the amendment, specify when measures or
    improvements provided pursuant to this subsection will be provided.
     (e) Providing improvements that would benefit modes other than the
    significantly affected mode, improvements to facilities other than the
    significantly affected facility, or improvements at other locations, if the
    provider of the significantly affected facility provides a written
    statement that the system-wide benefits are sufficient to balance the
    significant effect, even though the improvements would not result in
    consistency for all performance standards.
(3) Notwithstanding sections (1) and (2) of this rule, a local government
may approve an amendment that would significantly affect an existing
transportation facility without assuring that the allowed land uses are
consistent with the function, capacity and performance standards of the
facility where:
    (a) In the absence of the amendment, planned transportation facilities,
    improvements and services as set forth in section (4) of this rule would
    not be adequate to achieve consistency with the identified function,
    capacity or performance standard for that facility by the end of the
    planning period identified in the adopted TSP;
    (b) Development resulting from the amendment will, at a minimum,
    mitigate the impacts of the amendment in a manner that avoids
    further degradation to the performance of the facility by the time of
    the development through one or a combination of transportation
    improvements or measures;
    (c) The amendment does not involve property located in an
    interchange area as defined in paragraph (4)(d)(C); and
    (d) For affected state highways, ODOT provides a written statement
    that the proposed funding and timing for the identified mitigation
    improvements or measures are, at a minimum, sufficient to avoid
    further degradation to the performance of the affected state highway.
    However, if a local government provides the appropriate ODOT
    regional office with written notice of a proposed amendment in a
    manner that provides ODOT reasonable opportunity to submit a
    written statement into the record of the local government proceeding,
    and ODOT does not provide a written statement, then the local
    government may proceed with applying subsections (a) through (c) of
    this section.
(4) Determinations under sections (1)–(3) of this rule shall be coordinated
with affected transportation facility and service providers and other
affected local governments.

OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
   (a) In determining whether an amendment has a significant effect on
   an existing or planned transportation facility under subsection (1)(c) of
   this rule, local governments shall rely on existing transportation
   facilities and services and on the planned transportation facilities,
   improvements and services set forth in subsections (b) and (c) below.
   (b) Outside of interstate interchange areas, the following are
   considered planned facilities, improvements and services:

      (A) Transportation facilities, improvements or services that are
      funded for construction or implementation in the Statewide
      Transportation Improvement Program or a locally or regionally
      adopted transportation improvement program or capital
      improvement plan or program of a transportation service provider.

      (B) Transportation facilities, improvements or services that are
      authorized in a local transportation system plan and for which a
      funding plan or mechanism is in place or approved. These include,
      but are not limited to, transportation facilities, improvements or
      services for which: transportation systems development charge
      revenues are being collected; a local improvement district or
      reimbursement district has been established or will be established
      prior to development; a development agreement has been
      adopted; or conditions of approval to fund the improvement have
      been adopted.

      (C) Transportation facilities, improvements or services in a
      metropolitan planning organization (MPO) area that are part of the
      area's federally-approved, financially constrained regional
      transportation system plan.

      (D) Improvements to state highways that are included as planned
      improvements in a regional or local transportation system plan or
      comprehensive plan when ODOT provides a written statement that
      the improvements are reasonably likely to be provided by the end
      of the planning period.

      (E) Improvements to regional and local roads, streets or other
      transportation facilities or services that are included as planned
      improvements in a regional or local transportation system plan or
      comprehensive plan when the local government(s) or
      transportation service provider(s) responsible for the facility,
      improvement or service provides a written statement that the
      facility, improvement or service is reasonably likely to be provided
      by the end of the planning period.

OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
   (c) Within interstate interchange areas, the improvements included in
   (b)(A)–(C) are considered planned facilities, improvements and
   services, except where:

       (A) ODOT provides a written statement that the proposed funding
       and timing of mitigation measures are sufficient to avoid a
       significant adverse impact on the Interstate Highway system, then
       local governments may also rely on the improvements identified in
       paragraphs (b)(D) and (E) of this section; or

        (B) There is an adopted interchange area management plan, then
        local governments may also rely on the improvements identified in
        that plan and which are also identified in paragraphs (b)(D) and (E)
        of this section.
    (e) For purposes of this section, a written statement provided pursuant
    to paragraphs (b)(D), (b)(E) or (c)(A) provided by ODOT, a local
    government or transportation facility provider, as appropriate, shall be
    conclusive in determining whether a transportation facility,
    improvement or service is a planned transportation facility,
    improvement or service. In the absence of a written statement, a local
    government can only rely upon planned transportation facilities,
    improvements and services identified in paragraphs (b)(A)-(C) to
    determine whether there is a significant effect that requires
    application of the remedies in section (2).
 (5) The presence of a transportation facility or improvement shall not be
a basis for an exception to allow residential, commercial, institutional or
industrial development on rural lands under this division or OAR 660-004-
0022 and 660-004-0028.
(6) In determining whether proposed land uses would affect or be
consistent with planned transportation facilities as provided in sections (1)
and (2), local governments shall give full credit for potential reduction in
vehicle trips for uses located in mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly centers,
and neighborhoods as provided in subsections (a)–(d) below;
    (a) Absent adopted local standards or detailed information about the
    vehicle trip reduction benefits of mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly
    development, local governments shall assume that uses located within
    a mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly center, or neighborhood, will
    generate 10% fewer daily and peak hour trips than are specified in
    available published estimates, such as those provided by the Institute
    of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual that do not
    specifically account for the effects of mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly
    development. The 10% reduction allowed for by this section shall be
    available only if uses which rely solely on auto trips, such as gas
    stations, car washes, storage facilities, and motels are prohibited;
    (b) Local governments shall use detailed or local information about the
    trip reduction benefits of mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly development
    where such information is available and presented to the local
    government. Local governments may, based on such information,
    allow reductions greater than the 10% reduction required in
    subsection (a) above;

OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
    (c) Where a local government assumes or estimates lower vehicle trip
    generation as provided in subsection (a) or (b) above, it shall assure
    through conditions of approval, site plans, or approval standards that
    subsequent development approvals support the development of a
    mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly center or neighborhood and provide for
    on-site bike and pedestrian connectivity and access to transit as
    provided for in OAR 660-012-0045(3) and (4). The provision of on-site
    bike and pedestrian connectivity and access to transit may be
    accomplished through application of acknowledged ordinance
    provisions which comply with 660-012-0045(3) and (4) or through
    conditions of approval or findings adopted with the plan amendment
    that assure compliance with these rule requirements at the time of
    development approval; and
    (d) The purpose of this section is to provide an incentive for the
    designation and implementation of pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use
    centers and neighborhoods by lowering the regulatory barriers to plan
    amendments which accomplish this type of development. The actual
    trip reduction benefits of mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly development
    will vary from case to case and may be somewhat higher or lower than
    presumed pursuant to subsection (a) above. The Commission
    concludes that this assumption is warranted given general information
    about the expected effects of mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly
    development and its intent to encourage changes to plans and
    development patterns. Nothing in this section is intended to affect the
    application of provisions in local plans or ordinances which provide for
    the calculation or assessment of systems development charges or in
    preparing conformity determinations required under the federal Clean
    Air Act.
 (7) Amendments to acknowledged comprehensive plans and land use
regulations which meet all of the criteria listed in subsections (a)–(c)
below shall include an amendment to the comprehensive plan,
transportation system plan the adoption of a local street plan, access
management plan, future street plan or other binding local transportation
plan to provide for on-site alignment of streets or access ways with
existing and planned arterial, collector, and local streets surrounding the
site as necessary to implement the requirements in OAR 660-012-
0020(2)(b) and 660-012-0045(3):
    (a) The plan or land use regulation amendment results in designation
    of two or more acres of land for commercial use;
    (b) The local government has not adopted a TSP or local street plan
    which complies with OAR 660-012-0020(2)(b) or, in the Portland
    Metropolitan Area, has not complied with Metro's requirement for
    street connectivity as contained in Title 6, Section 3 of the Urban
    Growth Management Functional Plan; and
    (c) The proposed amendment would significantly affect a
    transportation facility as provided in section (1).

OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
(8) A "mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly center or neighborhood" for the
purposes of this rule, means:

   (a) an existing central business district or downtown; an area
   designated as a central city, regional center, town center or main
   street in the Portland Metro 2040 Regional Growth Concept; an area
   designated in an acknowledged comprehensive plan as a transit
   oriented development or a pedestrian district; or an area designated
   as a special transportation area as provided for in the Oregon Highway
   Plan.

   (b) An area other than those listed in subsection (a) above which
   includes or is planned to include the following characteristics:

       (A) A concentration of a variety of land uses in a well-defined area,
       including medium to high density residential development (12 or
       more units per acre); offices or office buildings; retail stores and
       services; restaurants; and public open space or private open space
       which is available for public use, such as a park or plaza.

       (B) Generally include civic or cultural uses;

       (C) A core commercial area where multi-story buildings are
       permitted;

       (D) Buildings and building entrances oriented to streets;

       (E) Street connections and crossings that make the center safe and
       conveniently accessible from adjacent areas;

       (F) A network of streets and, where appropriate, access ways and
       major driveways that make it attractive and highly convenient for
       people to walk between uses within the center or neighborhood,
       including streets and major driveways within the center with wide
       sidewalks and other features, including pedestrian-oriented street
       crossings, street trees, pedestrian-scale lighting and on-street
       parking;

       (G) One or more transit stops (in urban areas with fixed route
       transit service); and

        (H) Limit or do not allow low-intensity or land extensive uses, such
        as most industrial uses, automobile sales and services, and drive-
        through services.
 (9) Notwithstanding section (1) of this rule, a local government may find
that an amendment to a zoning map does not significantly affect an
existing or planned transportation facility if all of the following
requirements are met.
    (a) The proposed zoning is consistent with the existing comprehensive
    plan map designation and the amendment does not change the
    comprehensive plan map;

OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
    (b) The local government has an acknowledged TSP and the proposed
    zoning is consistent with the TSP; and
    (c) The area subject to the zoning map amendment was not exempted
    from this rule at the time of an urban growth boundary amendment as
    permitted in OAR 660-024-0020(1)(d), or the area was exempted from
    this rule but the local government has a subsequently acknowledged
    TSP amendment that accounted for urbanization of the area.
(10) Notwithstanding sections (1) and (2) of this rule, a local government
may amend a functional plan, a comprehensive plan or a land use
regulation without applying performance standards related to motor
vehicle traffic congestion (e.g. volume to capacity ratio or V/C), delay or
travel time if the amendment meets the requirements of subsection (a) of
this section. This section does not exempt a proposed amendment from
other transportation performance standards or policies that may apply
including, but not limited to, safety for all modes, network connectivity for
all modes (e.g. sidewalks, bicycle lanes) and accessibility for freight
vehicles of a size and frequency required by the development.
    (a) A proposed amendment qualifies for this section if it:

      (A) Is a map or text amendment affecting only land entirely within
      a multimodal mixed-use area (MMA); and

      (B) Is consistent with the definition of an MMA and consistent with
      the function of the MMA as described in the findings designating
      the MMA.

(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
   (b) For the purpose of this rule, “multimodal mixed-use area” or
   “MMA” means an area:

      (A) With a boundary adopted by a local government as provided in
      subsection (d) or (e) of this section and that has been
      acknowledged;

      (B) Entirely within an urban growth boundary;

      (C) With adopted plans and development regulations that allow
      the uses listed in paragraphs (8)(b)(A) through (C) of this rule and
      that require new development to be consistent with the
      characteristics listed in paragraphs (8)(b)(D) through (H) of this
      rule;

      (D) With land use regulations that do not require the provision of
      off-street parking, or regulations that require lower levels of off-
      street parking than required in other areas and allow flexibility to
      meet the parking requirements (e.g. count on-street parking, allow
      long-term leases, allow shared parking); and

      (E) Located in one or more of the following categories below: (i) At
      least one-quarter mile from any ramp terminal intersection of
      existing or planned interchanges; (ii) Within the area of an adopted
      Interchange Area Management Plan (IAMP) and consistent with
      the IAMP; or (iii) Within one-quarter mile of a ramp terminal
      intersection of an existing or planned interchange if the mainline
      facility provider has provided written concurrence with the MMA
      designation as provided in subsection (c) of this section.



   (c) When a mainline facility provider reviews an MMA designation as
   provided in subparagraph (b)(E)(iii) of this section, the provider must
   consider the factors listed in paragraph (A) of this subsection.

      (A) The potential for operational or safety effects to the
      interchange area and the mainline highway, specifically
      considering: (i) whether the interchange area has a crash rate that
      is higher than the statewide crash rate for similar facilities; (ii)
      whether the interchange area is in the top ten percent of locations
      identified by the safety priority index system (SPIS) developed by
      ODOT; and (iii) whether existing or potential future traffic queues
      on the interchange exit ramps extend onto the mainline highway
      or the portion of the ramp needed to safely accommodate
      deceleration.

      (B) If there are operational or safety effects as described in
      paragraph (A) of this subsection, the effects may be addressed by
      an agreement between the local government and the facility
      provider regarding traffic management plans favoring traffic
      movements away from the interchange, particularly those
      facilitating clearing traffic queues on the interchange exit ramps.

OAR 660-012-0060: Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(This table addresses plan amendments. It applies when changes to the Comprehensive Plan and TSP are proposed.)
   (d) A local government may designate an MMA by adopting an
   amendment to the comprehensive plan or land use regulations to
   delineate the boundary following an existing zone, multiple existing
   zones, an urban renewal area, other existing boundary, or establishing
   a new boundary. The designation must be accompanied by findings
   showing how the area meets the definition of an MMA. Designation of
   an MMA is not subject to the requirements in sections (1) and (2) of
   this rule.
   (e) A local government may designate an MMA on an area where
   comprehensive plan map designations or land use regulations do not
   meet the definition, if all of the other elements meet the definition, by
   concurrently adopting comprehensive plan or land use regulation
   amendments necessary to meet the definition. Such amendments are
   not subject to performance standards related to motor vehicle traffic
   congestion, delay or travel time.
(11) A local government may approve an amendment with partial
mitigation as provided in section (2) of this rule if the amendment
complies with subsection (a) of this section, the amendment meets the
balancing test in subsection (b) of this section, and the local government
coordinates as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
   (a) The amendment must meet paragraphs (A) and (B) of this
   subsection or meet paragraph (D) of this subsection.

      (A) Create direct benefits in terms of industrial or traded-sector
      jobs created or retained by limiting uses to industrial or traded-
      sector industries.

      (B) Not allow retail uses, except limited retail incidental to
      industrial or traded sector development, not to exceed five percent
      of the net developable area.

      (C) For the purpose of this section: (i) “industrial” means
      employment activities generating income from the production,
      handling or distribution of goods including, but not limited to,
      manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, processing, storage, logistics,
      warehousing, importation, distribution and transshipment and
      research and development; and (ii) “traded-sector” means
      industries in which member firms sell their goods or services into
      markets for which national or international competition exists.

      (D) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B) of this subsection, an
      amendment complies with subsection (a) if all of the following
      conditions are met: (i) The amendment is within a city with a
      population less than 10,000 and outside of a Metropolitan
      Planning Organization; (ii) the amendment would provide land for
      “Other Employment Use” or “Prime Industrial Land” as those terms
      are defined in OAR 660-009-0005; and (iii) The amendment is
      located outside of the Willamette Valley as defined in ORS
      215.010.

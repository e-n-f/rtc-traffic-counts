EXPLANATIONS

QTb - Boring Lavas (Pliocene to Pleistocene) – Light-gray to gray, diktytaxitic, olivine- (less commonly
plagioclase-) phyric basalt and basaltic andesite flows erupted from a series of local vents. Eruptive
activity associated with Boring lavas build cones (e.g., Mount Sylvania and Cooks Butte) composed of
interstratified cinders and lava. Boring lava flows are poorly exposed due to variable degrees of deep
weathering and/or mantling by loess. Exceptions occur where catastrophic flood waters have eroded
away overlying deposits or in excavations. Boring lava flows typically display blocky to columnar jointing
and, if preserve, vesicular flow tops. Thickness of unit QTb is highly variable, ranging from >600 ft at a
vent to <50 ft for individual flows away from the vent. Age of unit QTb within the map area is poorly
constrained; reversed magnetic polarity of all sampled flows within the map area (based on portable
fluxgate magnetometer determinations) indicate an age of >700,000 years. Boring flows can be

distinguished from older basalt units on the basis of physical appearance, stratigraphic position,
lithology, and major oxide composition (Table 1)
Columbia River Basalt Group (middle Miocene) – Miocene tholeiitic flood-basalt flows that were
erupted from long linear fissure systems in northeastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and western
Idaho from approximately 17 to 6 Ma (Swanson and others, 1979; Hooper, 1982). Many individual flows
are known to be huge in size, often covering thousands to tens of thousands of square miles and ranging
from hundreds to thousands of cubic miles in volume (Tolan and others, 1989). These flows entered
western Oregon via a wide gap in the northern Oregon Miocene Cascade Range (Beeson and others,
1985; Beeson and Tolan, in press); some flows even reached the Pacific Ocean (Beeson and others,
1979). Significant differences and variations in the geochemical, paleomagnetic, and lithological
properties of Columbia River Basalt Group flows allow this series of flood-basalt flows to be formally
divided into five formations (Swanson and others, 1979) and also enable these formations to be further
subdivided into a host of mappable members and units (Swanson and others, 1979; Beeson and others,
1985, Reidel and others, 1989). Members and units belonging to the Wanapum and Grande Ronde
Basalts, two of the five Columbia River Basalt Group formations, are present within the map area and
have a collective thickness ranging up to >670 ft

Tfsh - Basalt of Sand Hollow (middle Miocene) – Four flows are present within the map area. Flows
typically are blocky to columnar jointed, but occasionally display entablature/colonnade jointing style.
Fresh exposures are dark gray to black; weathered surfaces are typically greenish gray to black. The
three oldest flows (“+3, +4, and +5” units of Beeson and others [1975]) are find to coarse grained,
occasionally diktytaxitic, and sparsely plagioclase phyric, with phenocrysts <2 cm in size. The youngest
Sand Hollow flow is typically diktytaxitic, medium to coarse grained, and plagioclase phyric, with
phenocrysts and glomerocrysts that commonly range from 2 to 5 cm in size. Unit thickness is variable,
ranging from <50 to >200 ft. Sand Hollow flows can e distinguished from both the Sentinel Gap and
Ginkgo flows on the combined basis of stratigraphic position, lithology, and composition (Table 1). Both
low- to intermediate-P2O5 compositional types (Beeson and others, 1985) are present within the map
area. Beeson and others (1985) report a K0Ar date of 15.3 Ma for this unit

Tfg - Basalt of Ginkgo (middle Miocene) – Two flows are present within the map area. Flows are
commonly blocky to columnar jointed, often displaying well-formed prismatic colonnades. Fresh
exposures are dark gray to black; weathered surfaces are commonly reddish brown to gray. Both flows
are typically medium-grained, plagioclase-microphyric basalt, with laths <0.1 cm in size, and abundantly
plagioclase phyric, with phenocrysts and glomerocrysts ranging from 0.3 to 2 cm in size. The upper
Ginkgo flow is commonly diktytaxitic. Thickness of this unit varies from 50 to >200 ft within the map
area. Ginkgo flows can be distinguished from plagioclase-phyric Sand Hollow flow on the combined basis
of stratigraphic positions, composition (Table 1), and excursional paleomagnetic polarity (Beeson and
others, 1985). This unit commonly overlies a thin (commonly approximately 1-ft-thick), discontinuous,
sedimentary interbed that ranges from fluvial arkosic, micaceous sandstone to paleosol. This sediment is
equivalent to the Vantage Member of the Ellensburg Formation (Swanson and others, 1979; Beeson and
others, 1985) and is not shown here as a separate map unit because of its relative thinness

Tgsb - Grande Ronde Basalt (middle Miocene), Sentinel Bluffs unit (middle Miocene) – Within the map
area, two flows that were formerly designated as “-1 and -2 flows” of Beeson and Moran (1979) are
present. Flows typically display blocky to columnar jointing and rarely display an entablature/colonnade
jointing pattern. Fresh exposures are light to dark gray; weathered surfaces are greenish gray to dark
gray. The lower flow is typically fine- to medium-grained basalt and sparsely plagioclase phyric, with
small (<0.5 cm) tabular plagioclase phenocrysts. The upper flow is fine to medium grained, commonly

diktytaxitic, and aphyric. Unit thickness ranges from 25 to 150 ft within the map area. Sentinel Bluffs
flows are distinguished from both younger Frenchman Springs units and older Grande Ronde units on
the basis of stratigraphic position, composition (Table 1), lithology, and normal paleomagnetic polarity
(see Reidel and others, 1989; Beeson and others, 1989). Long and Duncan (1982) report a 40Ar/29Ar date
of approximately 15.6 Ma for the youngest flows of this unit on the Columbia Plateau

Tgww - Winter Water unit (middle Miocene) – Within the map area, two flows that were formerly
designated as the “-3 flow” of Beeson and others (1975) or “N2 low-MgO flows” of Beeson and Moran
(1979) are present. Winter Water flows display a wide range of jointing patterns, from columnar to
entablature/colonnade. Fresh exposures are dark gray to black; weathered surfaces are greenish gray to
grayish black. Both flows are typically glassy to fine grained and phyric to abundantly phyric, with small
(<0.3 cm) plagioclase glomerocrysts that often display a distinctive radial or spoke-shaped habit.
Distribution of glomerocrysts is often uneven and tends to be less abundant in the basal portion of the
flow. Unit thickness ranges from 25 to 100 ft within the map area. Winter Water flows are distinguished
from other Grande Ronde units on the basis of lithology, composition (Table 1), stratigraphic position,
and normal paleomagnetic polarity (see Reidel and others, 1989; Beeson and others, 1989)

RE: Luscher Farms Master Plan Transportation Analysis

Dear Ms. Gilmer,

This transportation assessment report has been prepared to support the proposed Luscher Farms
Master Plan in Lake Oswego, Oregon. This report examines the characteristics of the Luscher Farms
Master Plan proposal and identifies the transportation infrastructure needs required to support the
overall master plan vision.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The existing Luscher Area is located in the northeast quadrant of the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
intersection in Lake Oswego as illustrated in Figure 1. The area currently consists of a multi-use sports
field, a children’s play area, walking and biking trails, a 114-stall parking lot, off-leash dog parks,
community gardens, wetlands, open space, environmental/agricultural education facilities, and other
support facilities.

Since the last master planning effort was completed in 1997, the City of Lake Oswego acquired four
properties totaling 81.43 additional acres of land to add to the 70.59 acres that were already owned by
the City. These new land acquisitions, paired with the fact that the City’s parks and recreation needs
have changed over the last 15 years, prompted the City to create a new master plan for the 152-acre
Luscher Area.

The master plan is intended to provide long-term direction for the development of all of the public
properties in the Luscher Area. The new Master Plan vision includes the following elements in addition
to the existing attributes: two neighborhood parks (Farr and Rassekh properties), 8-court tennis center
and parking lot, multi-use athletic field and parking lot, two basketball courts, oak upland and grassland
restoration, stream and riparian area restoration, expanded community gardens, environmental
education center, agriculture-theme children's play area, open-air shelter, ropes challenge course, and
three new trailheads. Figure 2 illustrates the specific Master Plan vision.

SCOPE OF THE REPORT
The study area includes the following intersections during the weekday p.m. peak hour1:

                Stafford Road/Overlook Drive/Existing Luscher Park Access
                Stafford Road/Rosemont Road/Atherton Road
This report addresses the following transportation issues:

                Year 2012 existing land-use and transportation-system conditions within the site vicinity
                 during the weekday p.m. peak period;
                Forecast year 2032 background traffic conditions (without the Luscher Farms Master Plan
                 vision) during the weekday p.m. peak period;
                Trip generation potential for the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision;
                Forecast year 2032 total traffic conditions (with the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision)
                 during the weekday p.m. peak period; and
                Site access analysis.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.



Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The Luscher Area currently consists of a multi-use sports field, a children’s play area, walking and biking
trails, a 114-stall parking lot, off-leash dog parks, community gardens, wetlands, open space, and
environmental/agricultural education facilities. The area is bounded by Stafford Road to the west,
Rosemont Road to the south, and rural residential areas to the north and east. Vehicular access to the
existing recreational amenities is provided via an access road located at the Stafford Road/Overlook
Drive intersection. In addition, there is a small gravel parking area off of Stafford Road that provides
alternative access to the Luscher Farms dog park and recreational trail.

Traffic Volumes and Peak Hour Operations
In May 2012, manual turning movement counts were obtained for all of the existing study
intersections. All of the counts used in this analysis were conducted on a typical mid-week day during
the evening (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak time period. Figure 4 summarizes the existing weekday p.m.
turning-movement counts. All volumes shown are rounded to the nearest five vehicles per hour.
Appendix “A” contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.


LEVEL OF SERVICE DESCRIPTION & OPERATING STANDARDS
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. A description of level of service and the criteria by which
they are determined is presented in Appendix “B”. Appendix “B” also indicates how level of service is
measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service.

To ensure that this analysis was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, the peak 15-minute flow
rate during the peak hour analysis periods was used in the evaluation of all intersection levels of
service. Traffic conditions during other typical weekday hours and throughout most weekends will
likely be better than those described in this report.

Level of service analyses in this report for signalized and roundabout intersections are based on the
intersection’s ability to accommodate the most difficult, or critical, approach. Level of service analyses
for signalized intersections in this report are based on the average control delay per vehicle entering
the intersection. The City of Lake Oswego bases intersection operations on level of service (LOS). City of
Lake Oswego standards require that intersections operate at level of service “E” or better (less than 80
seconds of average per vehicle control delay), which includes the Stafford Road/Overlook Drive
intersection. Clackamas County requires that the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout operate at
level of service “D” (less than 55 seconds of average per vehicle control delay).

CURRENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Figure 4 and Table 2 summarize the level-of-service analysis for the study intersections under the
weekday p.m. peak hour existing traffic conditions. All of the study intersections currently operate
acceptably during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Appendix “C” includes the level-of-service worksheets
under year 2012 existing traffic conditions.

YEAR 2032 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The year 2032 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system may
operate without the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan vision within a 20-year time period. This
analysis accounts for traffic attributed to general growth in the region, but does not include traffic from
the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan.


PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
No funded transportation capacity improvements exist within the site vicinity. The only currently
identified (non-funded) project is the installation of bike lanes along Stafford Road south of the
Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES
While no specific development activities were noted that will add significantly to existing traffic
volumes in the immediate site vicinity, a three percent annual growth rate was assumed along the
Stafford Road and Rosemont Road corridors to account for continued regional traffic growth through
the study area. This growth rate is a conservative representation that is consistent with the Metro
Regional Travel Demand Model and other historical planning efforts in the area. The resulting 2032
weekday p.m. peak hour background traffic volumes are summarized in Figure 5.

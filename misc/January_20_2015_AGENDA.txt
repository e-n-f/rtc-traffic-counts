David DeYoung, Donnie Adams and Fred Smith.

Mr. DeYoung provided background information regarding PSD 2014-113,
LionsGate Phases 1A and 1B. The applicant is requesting approval of

acres.

     violate the character of existing standards for development of properties
     in the surrounding area.


     Finding Three
     That the subdivision design will provide for the distribution of traffic in a
     manner that will avoid or mitigate congestion within the immediate area,
     will provide for the unified and orderly use of or extension of public
     infrastructure, and will not materially endanger the environment, public
     health, safety, or the general welfare; and

     Finding Four
     That the subdivision will not adversely affect the general plans for the
     orderly growth and development of the town and is consistent with the

           Mr. Biggs offered a brief overview of this item, which was
           previously presented. No fiscal impact would be realized this
           year as this position would be funded utilizing budget from the
           over-hire position. All agreed this position will allow for community

     Action:      Approve position of Parks Police Officer

b.      Review and action on proposed contract to purchase real property
        located at 220 E. Main Street

        Mr. Biggs provided background information on this item, which
        was previously presented and discussed at the December 15,
        2014 town council meeting. Also provided was a copy of proposed
        contract for purchase of building located at 220 E. Main Street.

        Mayor McLeod questioned whether Council wished to continue
        with this item this evening or hold conversation at a future date
        when all council members were present. It was decided to
        continue discussion.

        Council Member Satterfield stated he gave much thought and
        consideration to this item. He believed moving forward with
        this item is the correct decision for the town.

        Mayor Pro Tem Grannis discussed his feelings regarding
        successful private/public transactions that have taken place in
        other municipalities. He stated we need to look at this from an
        economic development view and feels we need to look at the
        downtown. He has concerns that should we not move forward,
        this building could come down and create a vacant lot. While it’s
        possible someone would build, it is just as likely that someone
        would not. He states at the end of the day he needs to consider
        what is best for all residents. He would like to speak with
        residents who do not live or operate a business in the downtown
        area. At this time he is not prepared to vote on this item. He
        recommends this conversation be tabled for a later date.

        Council member Holder stated he has some concerns regarding
        private/ public partnerships and further, we do not currently have
        a private partnership lined up.

        Council Member Thompson echoed the feelings that currently we
        do have enough citizen input at this time to make a decision.

Action:       Table this item for further discussion at the February 2, 2015
              meeting

Motion:       Mayor Pro Tem Grannis
Second:       Council Member Thompson

     c.    Discussion and instruction regarding consideration of in-town
           urban archery season for 2016

           Mr. Biggs provided a background on this item which was
           previously discussed. State requires notification by April for the
           deadline of 2016 season. A discussion was held and council
           members stated they have not heard negative feedback regarding
           this issue.

Mr. DeYoung provided background information regarding PSD 2014-113,
LionsGate Phases 1A and 1B. The applicant is requesting approval of

acres.

     violate the character of existing standards for development of properties
     in the surrounding area.


     Finding Three
     That the subdivision design will provide for the distribution of traffic in a
     manner that will avoid or mitigate congestion within the immediate area,
     will provide for the unified and orderly use of or extension of public
     infrastructure, and will not materially endanger the environment, public
     health, safety, or the general welfare; and

     Finding Four
     That the subdivision will not adversely affect the general plans for the
     orderly growth and development of the town and is consistent with the

           Mr. Biggs offered a brief overview of this item, which was

           year as this position would be funded utilizing budget from the

b.      Review and action on proposed contract to purchase real property
        located at 220 E. Main Street

        Mr. Biggs provided background information on this item, which
        was previously presented and discussed at the December 15,
        2014 town council meeting. Also provided was a copy of proposed
        contract for purchase of building located at 220 E. Main Street.

        Mayor McLeod questioned whether Council wished to continue
        with this item this evening or hold conversation at a future date
        when all council members were present. It was decided to
        continue discussion.

        Council Member Satterfield stated he gave much thought and
        consideration to this item. He believed moving forward with
        this item is the correct decision for the town.

        Mayor Pro Tem Grannis discussed his feelings regarding
        successful private/public transactions that have taken place in
        other municipalities. He stated we need to look at this from an
        economic development view and feels we need to look at the
        downtown. He has concerns that should we not move forward,
        this building could come down and create a vacant lot. While it’s
        possible someone would build, it is just as likely that someone
        would not. He states at the end of the day he needs to consider
        what is best for all residents. He would like to speak with
        residents who do not live or operate a business in the downtown
        area. At this time he is not prepared to vote on this item. He
        recommends this conversation be tabled for a later date.

        Council member Holder stated he has some concerns regarding
        private/ public partnerships and further, we do not currently have
        a private partnership lined up.

        Council Member Thompson echoed the feelings that currently we
        do have enough citizen input at this time to make a decision.

Action:       Table this item for further discussion at the February 2, 2015
              meeting

Motion:       Mayor Pro Tem Grannis
Second:       Council Member Thompson

     c.    Discussion and instruction regarding consideration of in-town
           urban archery season for 2016

           Mr. Biggs provided a background on this item which was
           previously discussed. State requires notification by April for the
           deadline of 2016 season. A discussion was held and council
           members stated they have not heard negative feedback regarding
           this issue.

STAFF ANALYSIS AND COMMENTARY:

Overview
The applicant is requesting Council approval of a Special Intensity Allocation to allow up to 70% impervious surface
on the subject parcel, which is located within the Watershed Protection Overlay. In this case, 70% would equal a
total of 97.6 acres, an increase from the currently permitted 24%, or 33.5 acres. The purpose of the request is to
allow continued expansion of the Caterpillar site (south of NC 42 E).

Per §155.501(E)(2), non-residential development within the Watershed Protection Overlay is limited to 24% unless
a Special Intensity Allocation (SIA) is granted by the Town Council in accordance with §155.501(E)(4), allowing up
to 70% impervious within 10% of the total regulated watershed area.

Background
The State Legislature has in General Statute §§ 143-214.5, 160A-371, and 1601-38a delegated the responsibility
and authority to local governmental units to establish water supply watershed protection programs, to regulate
land use and development within water supply watersheds, and to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.

Watersupply Watershed Boundaries are established by the state. §155.501 of the Unified Development Code
regulates development within the Watersupply Watershed (known as the Watershed Protection Overlay in the
Town of Clayton). As noted, non-residential and multi-family development is limited to 24% impervious, and single
family development is limited to 2 units per acre, or 35% impervious (no SIA is available for single family
development per the UDC).

The State allows Towns to designate special intensity allowances (SIAs) to a maximum of 10% of the total area
within the Watersupply Watershed within their jurisdiction. This special allowance can be extended to non-
residential development and to multi-family development (such as apartments). This allows the Town to protect
the water supply while selecting specific properties to allow the higher coverage.

In Clayton’s jurisdiction (including the ETJ), approximately 50% of the SIA allowance has been delegated (specific
calculations are currently underway by the Planning Department). Examples of developments that have been
granted a SIA include Grifols and Novo Nordisk. See the map, below, and a larger map is attached to this report of
the SIA area.




                                                                                                Page 52 of 125
If approved, the site and acreage would be calculated into the total allowed SIA areas for Clayton. As noted,
currently an estimated 50% of the SIA area has been designated for the increase in impervious area.


CONSIDERATIONS

    10% of the total Watershed Protection Overlay may be designated as a Special Intensity Allocation (SIA).
    Approximately 50% is allocated.
    The current request will allow the southern Caterpillar site to be developed up to 70% impervious, or 97.6
     acres of impervious surface. The site is currently limited to 24%. The request would not extend to the
     Caterpillar site to the north.
    The Town Council shall decide by vote whether to grant the SIA.

Town of Clayton Planning Director



Re: Caterpillar Clayton – Special Intensity Request



Dear David:

Our Client, Caterpillar of Clayton, NC, respectfully requests a Special Intensity Allocation ( SIA) from the
Town of Clayton according to Town UDC Section 155.501(E)(4). Under this provision, Caterpillar would be
able to increase the site impervious area up to, but not exceeding, 70% of the total area and within 10% of
the total regulated water protection area, as approved by the Town Planning Director. Upon approval of
the requested SIA and in accordance with UDC Section 155.501(E)(4), Caterpillar would provide the
following:

    •   Minimize the impervious area to the extent possible and feasible
    •   Give consideration to dimension of proposed and required riparian buffers
    •   Direct stormwater away from surface waters when possible
    •   Follow best management practices in design of stormwater measures to minimize negative water
        quality impacts.
As a precursor to this growth, Caterpillar will continue to strive to remain stewards of the environment and
will work closely with the Town to provide those measures required to meet the conditions of this request.

Caterpillar Inc. has been a long supporter of Johnston County and the Town of Clayton and is hopeful the
Town will grant this request so the maximum potential of the Caterpillar site can be realized. Thank you for
your consideration.

Respectfully submitted,



Jay W. Smith, RLA, ASLA, LEED AP

archery"), as defined by the state wildlife resources commission, is
permitted on private property during the Urban Archery Season as
established by the State Wildlife Resources Commission.
     1.    This Section creates an exception from the Town ordinance
     (Section 130.03) prohibiting the discharge of firearms within Town
     limits.

     2.    Violations of this Section shall subject the offender to penalties
     set forth in Section 91.99. Additionally, persons who violate this

C. Securing the Harvest. Hunters will make every reasonable
effort to track wounded deer for the purpose of completing the
harvest and recovering the carcass. In the event that a wounded
deer cannot be recovered or leaves the permitted hunting tract,
the hunter immediately will notify the North Carolina Wildlife
Resources Commission and seek the assistance of a Wildlife
Officer. If an Officer of the Wildlife Resources Commission is not
timely available assistance may be sought through the Clayton

           possessing written permission from the property owner dated
           within the current calendar year.

           c.    Access. If accessing a hunting area requires passing through
           other private land, a hunter must receive written permission

     assumes no liability for the actions of persons hunting with a Town
     Hunting Permit or persons allowing hunters to make use of their
     property for hunting or access. Nothing herein shall prevent the
     voluntary or contractual shifting of any risk of loss by and between
     the property owners and permitted hunters.

     2.    A person exercising privileges granted pursuant to this Section
     voluntarily assumes full responsibility for any risk of loss, property

MEMORANDUM

 To:        Steve Biggs, Town of Clayton

 From:      Travis Fluitt, P.E.

 Subject:   Athletic Club Boulevard at Collinsworth Drive


Kimley-Horn has performed traffic counts and performed observations of existing traffic conditions at
the intersection of Athletic Club Boulevard at Collinsworth Drive in an attempt to address concerns
with drivers making the prohibited left turn from westbound Athletic Club Boulevard (ACB) into the
Riverwood schools.

Traffic Observations
School traffic operations were observed the afternoon of December 3rd and the morning of December
4th 2014. Morning drop-off at Riverwood Middle School starts at 7:45 AM with classes starting at 8:05
AM. Queues for the middle school drop-off never reached ACB. Some left turns off of were observed
ACB during the middle school drop-off.

Morning drop-off at Riverwood Elementary School runs from 8:25 to 8:45 AM. Queues extended back
to ACB by 8:25 and at worst reached approximately halfway to Manning Drive. The queue had
cleared off of ACB by 8:35 AM. No left turns from ACB into the school were observed during the
elementary school drop-off, at least not while there was a standing queue back to ACB.

Riverwood Middle School lets out at 3:10 PM. The queue extended back to ACB by 3:15 PM but
never wrapped around the corner onto ACB. This is because many parents park along the south side
of ACB between Collinsworth Drive and Manning Drive or on Collinsworth Drive and wait for the
students to come to them rather than waiting in the pick-up queue. Several of these parked vehicles
were observed to make a U-turn at Collinsworth Drive to head back into the neighborhood after
picking up. Several left-turns off of ACB into the schools were observed during the middle school
pick-up but never when there was a standing queue back to ACB. The middle school pick-up was
complete and all clear by 3:20 PM.

Although Riverwood Elementary School does not let out until 3:40, the pick-up queue extended back
to ACB by 3:25 PM, back to Manning Drive by 3:35 PM, and past Manning Drive by 3:45. A school
worker in an orange safety vest directed traffic at the intersection of ACB at Manning Drive from
approximately 3:40 to 3:50 PM to allow students to cross the intersection under the supervision of
school staff. Westbound ACB also backed up from Manning Drive to Collinsworth Drive at 3:50 PM
due to students crossing at Manning Drive. The queue into the school was off ACB by 3:55 PM, and

                                                                                       Page 87 of 125

pick-up was complete and clear by 4:05 PM. Some left turns off ACB were observed, but again never
when the queue was back to ACB.

Traffic Counts
Intersection turning movement counts were performed at the intersections of ACB at Collinsworth
Drive and ACB at Manning Drive on December 3, 2014. The AM peak hour was determined to be
from 7:45 to 8:45 AM, and the school PM peak hour was from 3:15 to 4:15 PM. The AM and school
PM peak hour traffic volumes are shown on the attached Figure 1, and the traffic count data is
attached. The count volumes confirm what was observed in the field with approximately 30
westbound left turns from ACB into the schools in the AM peak hour and 14 in the PM peak hour but
none during the elementary school peak.

Recommendations
Based on our field observations, the traffic count data, and discussions with you, we recommend that
a concrete median island be constructed at the intersection of ACB at Collinsworth Drive to prohibit
left turns from ACB onto Collinsworth Drive in either direction but allow left turns from both sides of
Collinsworth Drive onto ACB. Other median restriction options were determined to be too detrimental
to school traffic operations. The attached conceptual layout shows what such an island might look
like. It should be noted that this island will also prohibit through movements on Collinsworth Drive;
however, the neighborhood street network (e.g. Manning Drive) provides alternate routes by which to
accomplish these movements.

While not shown on the attached exhibit, we also recommend restriping the crosswalks at the
intersection when the median is constructed. It is also worth noting that although the median on the
western leg of ACB is shown in a bull-nose configuration, it could be left pull-back to allow the U-turn
movement from eastbound to westbound ACB if desired.

Kimley-Horn has prepared an opinion of probable cost of construction for the recommended median
island and is attached for reference. Assuming a 10 percent increase for contingency and 15 percent
for design costs, the estimated construction cost for the median island is approximately $20,000.

Dear Brandon Bordeaux:

This Letter of Intent ("LOI") acknowledges your agreement to grant Black Dot Capital & Real Estate Group, LLC (“BDC”) an
exclusive option to purchase the Lease Agreement with AT&T Wireless. By signing below, you grant BDC, or its affiliates
and/or assigns an exclusive option to purchase the landlord's rights, in the communications facility lease (the “Lease”) for the
premises (the “Site Location”) that is located on property (the “Property”) with an address of 1141 Shotwell Road Clayton,
North Carolina, 27520. You further grant BDC an option to acquire a communications, access and utilities easement over the
Site Location in conjunction with the lease. BDC shall pay a total purchase price of $264,640.00** less closing costs for the
Lease and the Easement (the “Purchase Price”), subject to the terms set forth below.

In consideration of the exclusive option to purchase being granted to BDC, BDC agrees to pay The Town of Clayton, a North
Carolina municipal corporation the sum of $100.00 for an option term of 90 days (“the Option Period”). Upon our receipt of this
letter executed by you, BDC will send you a lease purchase application package to complete and return to us. Our receipt of
the completed lease purchase application package will commence the Option Period, and we will forward to you a copy of this
LOI signed by us along with your option consideration.

During the Option Period, BDC may exercise the option by notifying you in writing sent by mail, facsimile, or email. If BDC
exercises the option, then BDC will become the assignee of the landlord's rights under the Lease Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in a Lease Purchase and Easement Agreement, a copy of which will be included in the lease
purchase application package mentioned above (the “Purchase Agreement”). You will pay all closing costs, more specifically
identified in Schedule I attached herewith, associated with the purchase of your Leases and the communications easement.
You will be responsible for any transfer or other taxes, and any recording fees.

You acknowledge that a $100.00 non-refundable cash deposit and the commitment by BDC to employ the time, effort and
expense to assess this option to purchase is good, valuable and sufficient consideration for the option granted herein. You
agree to cooperate fully with BDC during the Option Period. You shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) offer the Lease or the Site
Location for sale or assignment to any other person or entity; (b) negotiate, solicit or entertain any offers to sell or assign any
interest in the Lease or Site Location to any other person or entity; or (c) modify, amend, supplement, extend, renew, terminate
or cancel the Lease. You agree to notify BDC of any notice or correspondence pertaining to the Lease received during the
Option Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will retain the right to offer for sale the Property, excluding the Site Location.

This letter is intended as and shall be a legally binding commitment. In the event of a breach of this agreement by you, BDC
shall, in addition to its other rights and remedies, be entitled to compensation for its time, effort and expense to evaluate this
option to purchase and, in any action to enforce this letter agreement, to recovery of its reasonable attorneys’ fees.

Your signature below will indicate your agreement to the foregoing and authorizes BDC to proceed with the evaluation of this
option to purchase. If this letter is not executed and delivered to BDC within 14 days, it shall be null and void. The terms of
this letter are confidential and may not be disclosed without prior written consent of BDC, except to professionals engaged to
evaluate and conduct the transaction on your behalf.

ACKNOWLEDGED AND AGREED:

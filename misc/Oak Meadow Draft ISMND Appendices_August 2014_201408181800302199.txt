                                    1.0     INTRODUCTION

Live Oak Associates, Inc. (LOA) has prepared the following report, which describes the biotic
resources of the approximately 52-acre Oak Meadow Plaza project area located in
unincorporated Santa Clara County (County), within the City of Morgan Hill’s (City) sphere of
influence. The project site (“site” or “study area”) is comprised of six existing parcels of
undeveloped land that are contiguous and are generally bounded by Sunset Avenue to the east,
W. Edmundson Avenue and rural development to the south, and open space rural residential
lands to the north and west (APNs 767-15-028, 767-19-020, 767-19-024, 767-19-028, 767-19-
036, and a portion of 767-15-024). The project site is located in the Mount Madonna 7.5” U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangle within the NW 1/4 of sec 33, T9S, R3E, of the Mt.
Diablo Meridian (Figure 1).

It is our understanding the Oak Meadow Plaza project includes the planned development of up-to
54-units within the land proposed for annexation into the City of Morgan Hill on approximately
20 acres of the approximately 52 acre site (Section 1.1). The remainder of the property would
remain as open space. The following analysis addresses potential impacts resulting from the
proposed site development.

Site development of individual parcels can damage or modify biotic habitats used by sensitive
plant and wildlife species. In such cases, these projects may be regulated by state or federal
agencies, subject to provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and/or
covered by policies and ordinances of the City of Morgan Hill. This report addresses issues
related to: 1) sensitive biotic resources occurring on the site; 2) the federal, state, and local laws
regulating such resources, and 3) mitigation measures which may be required based on potential
impacts. As such, the objectives of this report are to:

•   Summarize all site-specific information related to existing biological resources;
•   Make reasonable inferences about the biological resources that could occur onsite based on
    habitat suitability and the proximity of the site to a species’ known range;
•   Summarize all state and federal natural resource protection laws that may be relevant to
    possible future site development;
•   Identify and discuss project impacts to biological resources likely to occur on the site within
    the context of CEQA or any state or federal laws; and

•     Identify avoidance and mitigation measures that would reduce impacts to a less-than-
      significant level as identified by CEQA and that are generally consistent with
      recommendations of the resource agencies for affected biological resources.


The analysis of impacts, as discussed in Section 3.0 of this report, is based on the known and
potential biotic resources of the site, discussed in Section 2.0. Sources of information used in the
preparation of this analysis included: 1) the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG
2012), 2) the Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California (CNPS 2012), and
3) manuals and references related to plants and animals of Santa Clara County.

A reconnaissance-level field survey of the study area was conducted on March 7, 2012, by LOA
ecologists Nathan Hale and Katrina Krakow, at which time the principal biotic habitats and land
uses of the various parcels were identified, and the constituent plants and animals were noted. A
follow-up survey of the site was conducted by Nathan Hale and LOA ecologist Pamela Peterson
on July 8, 2014 to examine in conditions of the site had changed. Focused surveys for sensitive
plant and animal species were not conducted as part of this study. The level of investigation was
sufficient to locate and establish the general extent of potentially suitable habitat present for such
species within the study area, but it was not sufficient to establish the presence or absence of
special status species.

1.1      PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project proposes to pre-zone and ultimately annex approximately 52 acres into the City of
Morgan Hill.      Expansion of the Urban Services Area (USA) boundary is proposed for
approximately 20 of the 52 acres to be consistent with the City’s Urban Growth Boundary
(UGB) and to allow the construction of up to 54 single-family homes; the remaining 32 acres
will remain undeveloped under an open space easement.

In order for the approximately 20-acre portion of the project site to be developed with residential
uses, the City must pre-zone the lands for residential development and apply to Santa Clara
County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to expand the USA boundary so that
urban services may be provided to these homes. Annexation of the 32-acre portion of the site

planned to be in an open space easement would also require application to LAFCO because the
lands would remain outside the USA boundary.

Access to the 54 homes is proposed from Denali Drive and Bryce Drive. In addition, the
following modifications are proposed to the existing lots to reconfigure them to be consistent
with the proposed USA expansion and annexation:

   •   The project proposes a lot line adjustment or parcel map to reconfigure six existing lots
       of record on the eastern side of the project site into up to four lots.

In addition to the 32 acres to remain in an open space easement, the project proposes to record
open space easements in the remaining areas of the project site with slopes in excess of 10
percent and limit the development potential of parcels that would remain under County
jurisdiction, requiring an amendment to Action 7.5 of the Community Development Element of
the City of Morgan Hill General Plan.

                                       2.0      EXISTING CONDITIONS

The study area is comprised of open space within the eastern foothills and alluvial valley flats of
the Santa Cruz Mountains. One residential property occurs within the southern portion of the
site. Much of the property has long been grazed by cattle. Surrounding lands primarily consist
of low-density to high-density residential development, a municipal water tank facility, a City
park, open space serving as active rangeland, and minor roadways. The study area itself consists
of grazed land including California annual grassland/pasture land, mixed oak woodlands, a small
man-made drainage system ending in an evaporation/detention basin in the eastern portion of the
site, and a single residence. Topographically, the study area contains flat low-land areas and
some foothill topography. Elevations of the site range from approximately 335 ft. (102 m) to
610 ft. (186 m) National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).

Three soil types from two soil series—Gilroy and Keefers—were identified on the project site
(Figure 2; Table 1; NRCS 2012). Of the soils types Keefers soils are considered hydric within 1
percent of their composition. Hydric soils are soils that are saturated, flooded, or ponded long
enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper soil horizons.
Under sufficiently wet conditions, they support the growth and regeneration of hydrophytic
vegetation. Gilroy soils are not considered hydric, although hydric inclusions may occur. Soils
of the site are not considered to be strongly alkaline in nature, which would preclude certain
sensitive plant species from establishing populations on the site. Serpentine soils are absent from
the site, indicating that plants adapted to such soils are highly unlikely to occur.

Annual precipitation in the general vicinity of the study area averages 22 inches, almost 95% of
which falls between November and April. Virtually all precipitation falls in the form of rain.
Stormwater runoff readily infiltrates the soils of the site or sheet-flows downhill. Some of the
sheet-flows in the southern portion of the site travel toward a roadside ditch along Edmundson
Avenue. Sheet-flows in the northern and eastern portions of the site appear to eventually collect
into a man-made system containing a poorly defined drain feature and a small evaporation basin.
The drain feature is hydrologically connected to an offsite basin uphill to the west of the site.
The offsite basin contains an overflow pipe that carries water underground eventually emerging
from an onsite culvert and into the onsite drain feature. Water in this ditch flows offsite to the
east into a roadside ditch along Sunset Avenue before flowing back onto the site via another
short ditch to an evaporation basin that was likely constructed for water quality protection due to
onsite cattle grazing. When this evaporation basin (Figure 3) collects enough water, an overflow
culvert carries water offsite into a pond within Morgan Hill Centennial Recreation Center. The
City’s pond overflows into municipal storm system during high precipitation events. It should
be noted that the onsite evaporation basin is primarily fed by sheet flow and ground water from
the surrounding lands and was dry during LOA’s March 2012 and July 2014 surveys.

2.1     BIOTIC HABITATS / LAND USES

The study area supports three biotic habitats that provide some biological habitat value for
certain species. For the purposes of this report, the biotic habitats and land uses of the site are
listed as, “California annual grassland”, “Mixed Oak Woodland”, and “Evaporation
Basin/Drainages” (Figure 3). In addition to these habitats the site also supports one rural
residential area. For the purposes of this report this area is listed as “developed/ruderal.” These
habitat/land use categories are discussed in greater detail below. A list of the vascular plant
species observed on the site is provided in Appendix A, a list of animal species observed or
expected to occur on the site is provided in Appendix B.

2.1.1     California Annual Grassland

Most of the study area is comprised of annual grasslands. This habitat serves as grazing lands
for cattle and portions of this habitat appear to be disced and mowed from time to time. The

majority of the eastern portion of this habitat was disced at the time of the March 2012 site visit
and several fire breaks were disced during the July 2014 site visit. One slight depression
occurring within the area mapped as California annual grassland appears to support occasional
ponding. This feature was noted as occurring along Edmundson Avenue to the west of the site’s
residential property driveway. This feature is described below.

Annual grasslands of the site were dominated by non-native grasses and forbs.               Grasses
occurring in this habitat were primarily of European descent and included foxtail barley
(Hordeum murinum), Italian rye grass (Festuca perennis), wild oats (Avena sp.), red brome
(Bromus madritensis ssp.      rubens), annual bluegrass (Poa annua), and forbs included red
stemmed filaree (erodium cicutarium), white stemmed filaree (Erodium moschatum), broad leaf
filaree (Erodium botrys), hayfield tarweed (Hemizonia congesta ssp. luzulifolia), pepperweed
(Lepidium nitidum), dove weed (Croton setigerus), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), California
buttercup (Ranunculus californicus), cutleaf geranium (Geranium dissectum), black mustard
(Brassica nigra), lotus (Lotus wrangelianus), bird's eye speedwell (Veronica persica), shepherd's
purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), red maids (Calandrinia ciliata), burclover (Medicago
polymorpha), western yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), rancher’s fiddleneck (Amsinckia
menziesii), vinegar weed (Trichostema sp.), sand spurry (Spergularia rubra), popcornflower
(Plagiobothrys sp.), checkerbloom (Sidalcea malviflora), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), mule
ear (Wyethia sp.), springbeauty (Claytonia sp.), lupine (Lupinus sp.), California poppy
(Eschscholzia californica), field marigold (Calendula arvensis), wild radish (Raphanus sativus),
bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), and Johnny jump up (Viola pedunculata), to name a few.

The depressional feature, mapped in figure 3 as a potential wetland swale, appears to support
vegetation that is fairly consistent with the surrounding upland habitats, as described here above,
but this feature was also noted as containing some wetland indicator species including curly dock
(Rumex crispus) that can result from prolonged inundation of surface water. Historical aerial
images (Google Earth 2014) of this feature do not show standing water, so the propensity of this
feature to hold water is fairly low, but field evidence suggests that ponding does occur.

Only one reptilian species, the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), was observed
within the annual grasslands during the March 2012 and 2014 surveys. No amphibian species

                                                 9
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                      PN 1617-02

were observed during these surveys. Several additional amphibian and reptilian species would
reasonably be expected to occur within this habitat type of the study area including, but not
limited to, the Pacific treefrog (Hyla regilla), California alligator lizard (Elgaria multicarinatus),
terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans), California kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula
californiae), Pacific gopher snake (Pituophis melanoleucus), and western rattlesnake (Crotalus
oreganus), which may forage in grassland-like open habitats for invertebrates and/or small
mammals.

Avian species observed in these areas include the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), golden
eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes
formicivorus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), mourning
dove (Zenaida macroura), rock dove (Columba livia), barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), Anna’s
hummingbird (Calypte anna), black phoebe (Sayornis nigricans), western scrub-jay
(Aphelocoma californica), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), American robin (Turdus
migratorius), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia
leucophrys), Brewer’s blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus), red-winged blackbird (Agelaius
phoeniceus), and house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). These and other bird species would be
expected to utilize the grasslands of the study area for foraging habitat, cover, and limited
breeding habitat.

Mammals observed in this habitat of the site included the California ground squirrel
(Otospermophilus beecheyi), Botta’s pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), and domestic dog
(Canis familiaris). Evidence in the form of scat was observed for the coyote (Canus latrans).
Other mammal species likely to occur include the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
California vole (Microtus californicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis). Predators that may be attracted to small mammals and invertebrates of the ruderal
fields include the American badger (Taxidea taxus), non-native red fox (Vulpes vulpes), grey fox
(Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), cougar (Puma concolor). In addition the
black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) is likely to occur.

2.1.2    Mixed Oak Woodland

Two patches of mixed oak woodland exist on the foothill slopes within the project area. One
patch occurs within the northwestern corner of the site and the other patch occurs within the
southern portion of the site. Within the eastern portion of the site, there are two general patches
of intact oak woodland habitat. The oak woodland is dominated by mature coast live oak
(Quercus agrifolia), blue oak (Quercus douglasiana), and valley oak (Quercus lobata) and also
contains California bay (Umbellularia californica) trees. The understory contains many of the
constituent species found within the grasslands of the site, but due to significant shading, other
species emerge, including bedstraw (Galium sp.), nettle (Urtica sp.), horehound (Marrubium
vulgare), blue dicks (Dichelostemma capitatum), wavyleaf soap plant (Chlorogalum
pomeridianum var.      divaricatum), birdfoot fern (Pellaea mucronata), common gumplant
(Grindelia camporum), wild cucumber (Marah fabaceus), bee plant (Scrophularia californica),
hedge parsley (Torilis arvensis), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and California
sagebrush (Artemisia californica).

The California slender salamander (Batrachoseps attenuatus) was the only amphibian observed
in this habitat type during the surveys of the habitat, although the Pacific treefrog, California
newt (Taricha torosa), yellow-eyed ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii xanthoptica), and arboreal
salamander (Aneides lugubris) are all expected to occur in this habitat. One reptile, the western
fence lizard, was observed in this habitat during the survey. This species was noted primarily,
though not exclusively, within a rocky outcrop area located along the top of the hill within the
southern patch of oak woodland habitat. Other reptiles expected to occur in this habitat type
include western skink (Eumeces skiltonianus), alligator lizard (Elgaria multicarinatus),
terrestrial garter snake, gopher snake, California kingsnake, and rattlesnake.

Avian species observed in this habitat include the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), Anna’s
hummingbird (Calypte anna), acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus), oak titmouse
(Baeolophus inornatus), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), dark-eyed junco (Junco
hyemalis), lesser goldfinch (Carduelis psaltria), and a common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus
nuttallii), the last of which was flushed from a roosting location in a rock outcrop during the
survey. Many avian species occurring in the adjacent grassland would be expected to occur in
this habitat type as well. This habitat supports high quality habitat for numerous species of

Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                    PN 1617-02

nesting birds including raptors. An active red-tailed hawk nest was observed within the oak
woodland habitat in the northwest portion of the site during the March 2012 survey.

Mammal sign observed within the oak woodland was limited to raccoon scat and sparsely
occurring California ground squirrel burrows along the margins of the woodland.               Other
mammalian species expected to occur within this habitat type may include the opossum, eastern
fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), western grey squirrel
(Sciurus griseus), striped skunk, coyote, domestic dog, domestic cat, and bobcat. The mountain
lion (Puma concolor) may also traverse through the site from time to time.

2.1.3    Evaporation Basin/Drainages

As previously mentioned the eastern portion of the study area supports some water features that
appear to be man-made and serve to direct waters of a portion of the site. These include a few
sections of drainage that are connected and that collect overflow water from an offsite pond to
the west. These drainages serve to direct water offsite into a roadside ditch then back onsite into
an evaporation/detention basin that appears to hold water following high precipitation. When
this basin fills, overflow water then flows into an overflow pipe that takes water offsite to a pond
located within the Morgan Hill Centennial Recreation Center. Water typically leaves the City’s
offsite pond via evaporation; however, in high precipitation events water would move into City
storm drains. The onsite drainages and basin were dry at the time of the March 2012 and July
2014 surveys. Soil cracking and evidence of mud in the form of deep cattle pockmarks was seen
in the east-flowing section of the drain feature and the evaporation basin.

Vegetation in the drain features was fairly sparse. The eastern flowing portion of the drain that
carries water offsite into a roadside ditch was dominated by seaside barley (Hordeum marinum)
and bare soil. It also included Italian ryegrass, hayfield tarweed, common knotweed (Polygonum
arenastrum), and spiny cocklebur (Xanthium spinosum). The section of the drain that carries
water from the roadside ditch back onto the project site, despite having defined bed and banks,
was mostly characteristic of the surrounding vegetation found in the grassland habitat.
Vegetation within the evaporation basin included curly dock (Rumex crispus), shining
pepperweed, burclover, English plantain (Plantago lanceolata), milk thistle, rush (Eleocharis
sp.), seaside barley, and hyssop loosestrife (Lythrum hyssopifolia) during the March 2012 survey.


                                                12
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                     PN 1617-02

During the July 2014 survey the basin was dominated by soft brome (Bromus hordeaceus),
seaside barley, rabbitsfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis), swamp pricklegrass (Crypsis
schoenoides), and California brome (Bromus carinatus).

Crayfish (Pacifastacus sp.) exoskeleton remains were observed in the bottom of the overflow
pipe from the evaporation basin. Fish species are absent from this drainage system, as any
hydrologic connection to potential fish habitat “downstream” is via high-water overflow pipe by
which fish would be blocked. “Upstream” habitat is unsuitable for fish. In high precipitation
years, this drainage system may provide breeding habitat for amphibians such as California
newts, pacific treefrogs, western toads, and bullfrogs, to name a few. Reptiles such as the
alligator lizard, western fence lizard, garter snake, gopher snake, California kingsnake, and
rattlesnake may be expected to exist on the adjacent grassland habitat and banks of the feature
during periods of inundation. As observed in the cattle prints of the dry soils at the bottom of the
basin, cattle utilize this feature for drinking water when inundated.

Birds observed or expected to occur within this habitat feature are the suite of species expected
to occur in the grassland habitat of the site. Riparian habitat does not exist in this drainage
system or anywhere onsite, therefore, riparian bird species occurring onsite would be limited to
those stopping to forage on the site from time to time en route to preferable habitats offsite.

Raccoon prints were observed in the evaporation basin bed and California ground squirrels were
prevalent along the margins of these features. Other mammalian species may utilize this feature
for water and marginal forage habitat such as the Botta’s pocket gopher, coyote, domestic dog,
bobcat, domestic cat, and black-tailed deer.

2.1.4    Developed/Ruderal

Only one residence is currently onsite. A single house, with associated barn, trailers, corrals, and
out-buildings, is located along the southern edge of the eastern portion of the site. The driveway
to the residence is from Edmundson Avenue. The land of the residence supports primarily non-
native landscaped vegetation and ruderal annual grassland vegetation. This land was surveyed
from outside of the feature, but several aspects of the feature were noted. This feature contained
a few trees including valley oak and pomegranate (Punica granatum). A small area of lawn was
noted, and a Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) patch was observed. Much of the area is

                                                 13
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                     PN 1617-02

highly disturbed due to driveway traffic and livestock activities within and between the barn and
corrals.

Developed lands such as this provide limited habitat for locally occurring wildlife species;
however, the rural nature of the developed lands within the study area provide some level of
continuity between more natural habitats. Ongoing disturbances occurring on developed lands
would reduce the value of the foraging habitat for wildlife and would preclude some of the
species that would occur on the more natural areas in the vicinity of these developed areas from
utilizing these areas for breeding habitat.

Animal species that may utilize the developed lands incidentally for forage and cover include
species observed or expected to occur on the surrounding habitat types.

2.2        MOVEMENT CORRIDORS

Many terrestrial animals need more than one biotic habitat in order to perform all of their
biological activities.   With increasing encroachment of humans on wildlife habitats, it has
become important to establish and maintain linkages, or movement corridors, for animals to be
able to access locations containing different biotic resources that are essential to maintaining
their life cycles. Terrestrial animals use ridges, canyons, riparian areas, and open spaces to travel
between their required habitats.

The importance of an area as a movement corridor depends on the species in question and its
consistent use patterns. Animal movements generally can be divided into three major behavioral
categories:

•     Movements within a home range or territory;
•     Movements during migration; and
•     Movements during dispersal.

While no detailed study of animal movements has been conducted for the study area, knowledge
of the site, its habitats, and the ecology of the species potentially occurring onsite permits
sufficient predictions about the types of movements occurring in the region and whether or not
proposed development would constitute a significant impact to animal movements.



                                                 14
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                    PN 1617-02

Lands surrounding the site have been developed with low density residences. Many of these
properties support livestock and are grazed to some extent, but other areas are purely residential
with neighborhoods and roads, which constrain, but do not completely impede, the movement of
wildlife between the site and more open lands. There are no creeks onsite that serve as a
movement corridor for local wildlife species that persist in nearby lands. However, the hills to
the west of the site may support a larger number of wildlife, and they may find their way to the
site from time to time.

2.3    SPECIAL STATUS PLANTS AND ANIMALS

Several species of plants and animals within the state of California have low populations and/or
limited distributions. Such species may be considered “rare” and are vulnerable to extirpation as
the state’s human population grows and the habitats these species occupy are converted to
agricultural and urban uses. As described more fully in Section 3.2, state and federal laws have
provided the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS) with a mechanism for conserving and protecting the diversity of plant and
animal species native to the state. A sizable number of native plants and animals have been
formally designated as “threatened” or “endangered” under state and federal endangered species
legislation. Others have been designated as candidates for such listing. Still others have been
designated as “species of special concern” by the CDFG. The California Native Plant Society
(CNPS) has developed its own set of lists of native plants considered rare, threatened, or
endangered (CNPS 2014). Collectively, these plants and animals are referred to as “special
status species.”

A number of special status plants and animals occur in the site’s vicinity (Figure 3). These
species and their potential to occur on the site are listed in Table 2 on the following pages.
Sources of information for this table included California’s Wildlife, Volumes I, II, and III (Zeiner
et al. 1988), California Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG 2014), Endangered and Threatened
Wildlife and Plants (USFWS 2014), State and Federally Listed Endangered and Threatened
Animals of California (CDFG 2014), and The California Native Plant Society’s Inventory of
Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California (CNPS 2014). This information was used
to evaluate the potential for special status plant and animal species that occur on the site. Figure
3 depicts the location of special status species found by the California Natural Diversity Data

Base (CNDDB). It is important to note that the CNDDB is a volunteer database; therefore, it
may not contain all known or gray literature records.

A search of published accounts for all relevant special status plant and animal species was
conducted for the Mount Madonna USGS 7.5” quadrangle in which the project site occurs and
for the eight surrounding quadrangles (Santa Teresa Hills, Morgan Hill, Mount Sizer, Loma
Prieta, Gilroy, Watsonville East, Watsonville West, and Chittenden) using the California Natural
Diversity Data Base Rarefind (CDFG 2014). All species listed as occurring in these quadrangles
on CNPS Lists 1A, 1B, 2, 3, or 4 were also reviewed.

Serpentine soils are absent from the site; as such, those species that are uniquely adapted to
serpentine conditions, such as the big-scale balsamroot (Balsamorhiza macrolepis var.
macrolepis), triburon paintbrush (Castilleja affinis ssp. neglecta), pink creamsacks (Castilleja
rubicundula ssp. rubicundula), coyote ceanothus (Ceanothus ferrisiae), Mt. Hamilton fountain
thistle (Cirsium fontinale var. campylon), San Francisco collinsia (Collinsia multicolor), Santa
Clara Valley dudleya (Dudleya abramsii ssp. setchellii), fragrant fritillary (Fritillaria liliacea),
Loma Prieta hoita (Hoita strobilina), wooly-headed lessingia (Lessingia hololeuca), smooth
lessingia (Lessingia micradenia var. glabrata), woodland woollythreads (Monolopia gracilens),
Metcalf Canyon jewel-flower (Streptanthus albidus ssp. albidus), most beautiful jewel-flower
(Streptanthus albidus ssp. peramoenus), and showy ranchería clover (Trifolium amoenum), are
considered absent from the site. Other plant species occur in habitats not present in the study
area (e.g., chaparral, broadleafed forest, coastal prairie, coastal scrub, etc.) or at elevations below
or above onsite elevations and, therefore, are also considered absent from the site. These species
include the Congdon’s tarplant (Centromadia parryi ssp. congdonii), robust spineflower
(Chorizanthe robusta var. robusta), sand gilia (Gilia tenuiflora ssp. arenaria), Anderson’s
manzanita (Arctostaphylos andersonii), Hooker’s manzanita (Arctostaphylos hookeri ssp.
hookeri), Pajaro manzanita (Arctostaphylos pajaroensis), Kings Mountain manzanita
(Arctostaphylos regismontana), Santa Cruz Mountains pussypaws (Calyptridium parryi var.
hesseae), Santa Clara red ribbons (Clarkia concinna ssp. automixa), sand-loving wallflower
(Erysimum ammophilum), Kellogg’s horkelia (Horkelia cuneata ssp. sericea), arcuate bush-
mallow (Malacothamnus arcuatus), Hall’s bush-mallow (Malacothamnus hallii), Santa Cruz
Mountains beardtongue (Penstemon rattanii var. kleei), Yadon’s rein orchid, (Piperia yadonii),

Choris’ popcorn-flower (Plagiobothrys chorisianus var. chorisianus), rock sanicle (Sanicula
saxatilis), Mt. Hamilton jewel-flower (Streptanthus callistus), and Santa Cruz clover (Trifolium
buckwestiorum).

Two of the aforementioned species in the genus Streptanthus were noted as “Possible on Oak
Meadow Plaza” in the City of Morgan Hill Urban Limit Line and Greenbelt Study General Plan
Amendment (Morgan Hill 2006), but both are associated with serpentine soils and serpentine
soils are lacking from the site.

Most of the special status plant and animal species listed (Table 2), may occur rarely or
occasionally on the study area and sufficient information exists to evaluate the potential imposed
impacts the project may ensue. Special status animal species that are known to occur within the
study area and that warrant further discussion includes the California tiger salamander and
burrowing owl. Below are more detailed discussions on these two species.

2.3.1    California tiger salamander

In February 1992, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was petitioned to list the California tiger
salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum californiense) as an endangered species under the authority of
the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA). Petitioning of the California tiger salamander was
originally proposed because the salamander had disappeared from approximately 55 per cent of
its historic range (Long 1992, Shaffer et al. 1993, Jennings and Hayes 1994). Remaining
populations are currently threatened by a wide variety of human impacts, including: urban
development, conversion of natural habitat to agriculture, construction of reservoirs and water
diversions, introduction of exotic predatory animals, and other anthropogenic factors such as
rodent control programs, vehicular-related mortality, etc. (Sorensen 1994, Fisher and Shaffer
1996, Jennings 1998). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service subsequently announced a 12-month
petition finding on April 18, 1994 that stated the petition was "warranted but precluded by
pending listing actions on higher priority species" (Sorensen 1994). In November 2000, the
USFWS emergency listed CTS within Santa Barbara County as Endangered, and also emergency
listed the Sonoma County population as Endangered in March 2003. On May 16, 2003, the CTS
was again petitioned for listing as a Threatened species. On August 4, 2004, the USFWS ruled
on the listing, and on September 3, 2004 the ruling took effect to list the CTS as Threatened
throughout California, and at the same time re-listed the Santa Barbara and Sonoma populations
as Threatened.

On February 9, 2009, the CDFG announced that the CTS was formally designated a candidate
for threatened or endangered listing status under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA).
On March 3, 2010, the CDFG declared that listing the CTS was warranted under CESA.

The California tiger salamander spends most of the year estivating in underground burrows
provided by California ground squirrels or Botta’s pocket gophers in grasslands and woodland


                                               23
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                 PN 1617-02

margins of California. There they feed on anything they can fit in their mouths including
earthworms, snails, insects, each other, and even small mammals. On rainy nights (typically
from November to February) adult CTS migrate from subterranean refugia to breeding pools
including vernal pools, stock ponds, substantive roadside ditches, etc. to mate and lay eggs.
Human made ponds are occasionally used for reproduction, and if predatory fish and bullfrogs
are present, populations can be highly suppressed or kept from breeding. After breeding and
egg-laying, adult CTS can linger at breeding pools for a few days to a few weeks, especially
male adults. Females typically migrate back to upland refugia following egg-laying or after
discovery that the subject breeding pond presents bad egg-laying conditions.        After larvae
mature, sometime in late spring or early summer, they disperse from shrinking breeding pools
and migrate up to 1.25 miles to find their own estivation sites (Trenham 2005).            Laval
individuals will hatch and feed within the pond until development is complete and they are able
to migrate to upland refugia. Undisturbed, adult CTS can live within upland habitats for up-to 8
years without breeding if conditions remain unsuitable during that time. This means that in some
cases several successful breeding events over a few decades can maintain a population.

Species specific surveys have not been conducted for CTS within the Oak Meadow Plaza project
area; however, the site could reasonably support estivation and breeding habitat for CTS. One
feature of the study area that may provide suitable breeding habitat for CTS is the evaporation
basin that is fed by the off-site pond (to the west and upslope from the evaporation pond) and by
runoff from surrounding areas. The basin holds water for multiple months during wet years and
heavy rain events; however, it may contain no water or limited water during medium to low
precipitation years. The evaporation basin was dry during the March 2012 and July 2014
surveys, which is representative of low-precipitation years. The off-site overflow pond has a
higher likelihood of supporting CTS on a more regular basis as it likely holds water for longer
periods of the year. When overflow occurs, potentially occurring CTS individuals (adults or
larvae) may be transported to the evaporation basin along with the overflow water. It is assumed
that the off-site pond was built in 2003, during construction of the adjacent Edmundson Water
Tank, to collect runoff water from the water tank development.         The nearest documented
occurrence of this species is within a half-mile of the site, near the corner of West Edmundson
and Sunnyside Avenues; however, this occurrence is comprised of a population of CTS now
presumed to be extirpated more than 30 years ago. However, this occurrence suggests that the

                                               24
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                    PN 1617-02

area has served as suitable habitat for CTS. It is uncertain to what degree additional pockets of
CTS breeding habitat may occur in the vicinity of the site or if the potentially suitable breeding
habitats on and off site provide for CTS.

In summary, while breeding and estivation habitat are not confirmed within the site, the
conditions and setting of the site suggest that the presence of CTS estivation and breeding is
feasible within the site. Specifically, the site and surrounding lands supports potentially suitable
estivation and breeding habitat for CTS, the site is located within a half mile of an historic
account of the species, critical habitat (designated by the USFWS) occurs just 2 miles to the
south of the site, and there is enough uncertainty to conclude a reasonable potential that CTS
could occur. Potential impacts and mitigations for this species are discussed below (Section
3.3.3).

2.3.2     Burrowing Owl

The burrowing owl is considered a California species of special concern. This listing was based
on the fact that the burrowing owl’s population levels were decreasing due to habitat destruction,
roadside nesting (vulnerability to human interference) and indirectly, ground squirrel poisoning.

The burrowing owl is a small, long-legged, semi-fossarial bird that averages a height of 9.5
inches, has an average wingspan of 23 inches, and weighs an average of 5.25 ounces. Burrowing
owls are unique, as they are the only owl that regularly lives and breeds in underground nests. In
California, these birds typically occur in the Central and Imperial Valleys, primarily utilizing
ground squirrel burrows (or the burrows of other animals, e.g., badgers, prairie dogs and
kangaroo rats) found in grasslands, open shrub lands, deserts, and to a lesser extent, grazing and
agricultural lands. Burrowing owls in this region are typically found in lower elevations, and
have strong site fidelity. Pairs have been known to return to the same area year after year for
breeding, and some pairs are known to utilize the same burrow as the previous year. The
breeding season for the burrowing owl typically occurs sometime during February through
August, with a peak between April and July.

While burrowing owls were not observed during the March 2012 or July 2014 surveys, ground
squirrel burrows that can serve as potential nests for burrowing owls occur in a fairly high
density within the study area, and grazed grassland habitat provides suitable foraging habitat for

                                                25
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                PN 1617-02

this species. The adjacent property surrounding the Edmundson Water Tank facility recently had
served as a habitat preserve designed for burrowing owls that was maintained by the City of
Morgan Hill, the management of which was administered by LOA. LOA has surveyed this
property multiple times per year since 2002. The only observations of burrowing owls on that
property were once in August 2002 in the form of burrowing owl sign (whitewash, feathers, and
pellets) and an unsuccessful relocation effort in 2003 by the Wildlife Education Rehabilitation
Center. No burrowing owls have been observed on that site since, which was the reason the
preserve status was terminated in early 2014. The most recent observation of an owl was at the
San Pedro percolation ponds in February 2007, Thus, there have been no known or documented
occurrences of burrowing owls within Morgan Hill for more than 7 years and none within the
vicinity of the study area for more than a decade. Regardless, the western burrowing owl is a
volant species that has been known to occur within the region.

2.4    JURISDICTIONAL WATERS

Jurisdictional waters include rivers, creeks, and drainages that have a defined bed and bank and
which, at the very least, carry ephemeral flows. Jurisdictional waters also include lakes, ponds,
reservoirs, and wetlands. Such waters may be subject to the regulatory authority of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), and
the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). Aquatic features are typically
only considered to be jurisdictional if they connect to other Waters of the United States per the
U.S Supreme Court decision Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (SWANCC Decision) and Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. Army Corps of
Engineers (referred together as the Rapanos decision).

A formal wetland delineation has not been completed at this time; however, several potential
wetland features were observed within the study area during the March 2012 survey. An
evaporation/detention basin was noted in the eastern portion of the site (Figure 3).           The
hydrology of this feature originates offsite, on the lands of the Edmundson Water Tank facility,
to the west. An offsite pond (Figure 3) appears to collect runoff water from the Edmundson
Water Tank facility and the surrounding hills. When this pond overflows, water is then piped
underground before it flows into an onsite drain feature that generally lines up with Yellowstone
Drive (Figure 3). Waters travel from this onsite feature to an offsite ditch along Sunset Avenue
before it flows back onsite into another small ditch and then into an onsite man-made
evaporation basin. Overflow water from this basin are taken offsite via an underground culvert
which empties into an offsite pond at the Morgan Hill Centennial Recreation Center. Waters of
the offsite city pond overflow into Little Llagas Creek. In addition to this hydrological system,
an area within the annual grasslands in the southern section of the site appears to support
ponding for portions of the year. This potential wetland swale appears to have been created as a
result of the construction of Edmundson Avenue and the driveway to the residential property.

The onsite features do not appear to replace the functions and values of any historic features, and
they all appear to have been created in upland habitat. There is some potential that the USACE
and RWQCB to claim jurisdiction over some or all portions of the features.

                              3.0     IMPACTS AND MITIGATIONS

3.1      SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

Projects of gaining approval of general plans, area plans, and specific projects are subject to the
provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The purpose of CEQA is to
assess the impacts of proposed projects on the environment before they are carried out. CEQA is
concerned with the significance of a proposed project’s impacts. For example, a proposed
development project may require the removal of some or all of a site’s existing vegetation.
Animals associated with this vegetation could be destroyed or displaced. Animals adapted to
humans, roads, buildings, pets, etc., may replace those species formerly occurring on the site.
Plants and animals that are state and/or federally listed as threatened or endangered may be
destroyed or displaced. Sensitive habitats such as wetlands and riparian woodlands may be
altered or destroyed.

Whenever possible, public agencies are required to avoid or minimize environmental impacts by
implementing practical alternatives or mitigation measures. According to Section 15382 of the
CEQA Guidelines, a significant effect on the environment means a “substantial, or potentially
substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic or
aesthetic interest.”

Specific project impacts to biological resources may be considered “significant” if they would:

•     Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any
      species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans,
      policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and
      Wildlife Service;
•     Have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community
      identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations or by the California Department of
      Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service;
•     Have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404
      of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.)
      through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means;
•     Interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife
      species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use
      of native wildlife nursery sites;


                                                    28
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                    PN 1617-02


      •   Conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources,
          such as a tree preservation policy or ordinance; or

      •   Conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural
          Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional, or state habitat
          conservation plan.

Furthermore, CEQA Guidelines Section 15065(a) states that a project may trigger the
requirement to make a “mandatory findings of significance” if the project has the potential to

          Substantially degrade the quality of the environment, substantially reduce the
          habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop
          below self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community,
          reduce the number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or threatened
          species, or eliminate important examples of the major periods of California
          history or prehistory.

3.2       RELEVANT GOALS, POLICIES, AND LAWS

3.2.1      Threatened and Endangered Species

State and federal “endangered species” legislation has provided the California Department of
Fish and Game (CDFG) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) with a mechanism for
conserving and protecting plant and animal species of limited distribution and/or low or
declining populations. Species listed as threatened or endangered under provisions of the state
and federal endangered species acts, candidate species for such listing, state species of special
concern, and some plants listed as endangered by the California Native Plant Society are
collectively referred to as “species of special status.” Permits may be required from both the
CDFG and USFWS if activities associated with a proposed project will result in the “take” of a
listed species. “Take” is defined by the state of California as “to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or
kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture or kill” (California Fish and Game Code, Section
86). “Take” is more broadly defined by the federal Endangered Species Act to include “harm”
(16 USC, Section 1532(19), 50 CFR, Section 17.3). Furthermore, the CDFG and the USFWS
are responding agencies under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).                 Both
agencies review CEQA documents in order to determine the adequacy of their treatment of
endangered species issues and to make project-specific recommendations for their conservation.

3.2.2    Migratory Birds

State and federal laws also protect most birds. The Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16
U.S.C., scc. 703, Supp. I, 1989) prohibits killing, possessing, or trading in migratory birds,
except in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior. This act
encompasses whole birds, parts of birds, and bird nests and eggs.

3.2.3    Birds of Prey

Birds of prey are also protected in California under provisions of the State Fish and Game Code,
Section 3503.5, which states that it is “unlawful to take, possess, or destroy any birds in the order
Falconiformes or Strigiformes (birds of prey) or to take, possess, or destroy the nest or eggs of
any such bird except as otherwise provided by this code or any regulation adopted pursuant
thereto.” Construction disturbance during the breeding season could result in the incidental loss
of fertile eggs or nestlings, or otherwise lead to nest abandonment. Disturbance that causes nest
abandonment and/or loss of reproductive effort is considered “taking” by the CDFG.

3.2.4    Bats

Section 2000 and 4150 of the California Fish and Game Code states that it is unlawful to take or
possess a number of species, including bats, without license or permit, as required by Section
3007. Additionally, Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations states it is unlawful to harass,
herd, or drive a number of species, including bats. To harass is defined as “an intentional act
which disrupts an animal's normal behavior patterns, which includes, but is not limited to,
breeding, feeding or sheltering.” For these reasons, bat colonies in particular are considered to
be sensitive and therefore, disturbances that cause harm to bat colonies are unlawful.

3.2.5    Wetlands and Other Jurisdictional Waters

Natural drainage channels and adjacent wetlands may be considered “Waters of the United
States” (hereafter referred to as “jurisdictional waters”) subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The extent of jurisdiction has been defined in the Code of
Federal Regulations but has also been subject to interpretation of the federal courts.
Jurisdictional waters generally include:




                                                 30
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                      PN 1617-02


•   All waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in
    interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of
    the tide;
•   All interstate waters including interstate wetlands:
•   All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams),
    mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural
    ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign
    commerce;
•   All impoundments of waters otherwise defined as waters of the United States under the
    definition;
•   Tributaries of waters identified in paragraphs (a)(1)-(4) (i.e. the bulleted items above).

As determined by the United States Supreme Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook
County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the SWANCC decision), channels and wetlands
isolated from other jurisdictional waters cannot be considered jurisdictional on the basis of their
use, hypothetical or observed, by migratory birds. However, the U.S Supreme Court decisions
Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (referred together as the
Rapanos decision) impose a "significant nexus" test for federal jurisdiction over wetlands. In
June 2007, the USACE and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established guidelines for
applying the significant nexus standard. This standard includes 1) a case-by-case analysis of the
flow characteristics and functions of the tributary or wetland to determine if they significantly
affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of downstream navigable waters and 2)
consideration of hydrologic and ecologic factors (EPA and USACE 2007).

The USACE regulates the filling or grading of such waters under the authority of Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act. The extent of jurisdiction within drainage channels is defined by “ordinary
high water marks” on opposing channel banks.            Wetlands are habitats with soils that are
intermittently or permanently saturated, or inundated. The resulting anaerobic conditions select
for plant species known as hydrophytes that show a high degree of fidelity to such soils.
Wetlands are identified by the presence of hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils (soils saturated
intermittently or permanently saturated by water), and wetland hydrology according to
methodologies outlined in the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (USACE
1987).

All activities that involve the discharge of fill into jurisdictional waters are subject to the permit
requirements of the USACE (Wetland Training Institute, Inc. 1991). Such permits are typically
issued on the condition that the applicant agrees to provide mitigation that result in no net loss of
wetland functions or values. No permit can be issued until the Regional Water Quality Control
Board (RWQCB) issues a certification (or waiver of such certification) that the proposed activity
will meet state water quality standards. The filling of isolated wetlands, over which the USACE
has disclaimed jurisdiction under the SWANCC decision, is regulated by the RWQCB. It is
unlawful to fill isolated wetlands without filing a Notice of Intent with the RWQCB. The
RWQCB is also responsible for enforcing National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permits, including the General Construction Activity Storm Water Permit. All projects
requiring federal money must also comply with Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands).

The California Department of Fish and Game has jurisdiction over the bed and bank of natural
drainages according to provisions of Section 1601 and 1602 of the California Fish and Game
Code (2003). Activities that would disturb these drainages are regulated by the CDFG via a
Streambed Alteration Agreement. Such an agreement typically stipulates that certain measures
will be implemented which protect the habitat values of the drainage in question.

Finally, the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan (SCVHP) requires payment of fees for impacts to
wetlands, ponds, streams, and riparian woodland habitats. These fees are based on the type(s) of
wetland habitat being impacted, and they reflect the costs required to restore and/or create type-
specific wetland habitats as mitigation of the wetlands being impacted. These fees would be
imposed during the project application process for coverage by the SCVHP.

3.2.6    Local Ordinances, Policies, and Habitat Conservation Plans

Tree ordinance.

The City of Morgan Hill has a tree ordinance defined in chapter 12.32 of the City’s municipal
code.   This ordinance seeks to protect all trees having a single stem or trunk with a
circumference of forty inches or greater for nonindigenous species (except those in residential
zones) and eighteen inches or greater for indigenous species measured at four and one-half feet
vertically above the ground or immediately below the lowest branch. Indigenous trees are
defined by the City as any tree that is native to the Morgan Hill region, including oaks (all types),

                                                 32
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                    PN 1617-02

California bays, madrones, sycamore and alder. The ordinance states that “it is unlawful for any
person to cut down, remove, poison or otherwise kill or destroy, or cause to be removed any tree
or community of trees on any city or private property without first securing a permit as provided
in [chapter 12.32 of the City’s municipal code]; provided, however, that a permit shall not be
required for developments which have been reviewed and approved by the planning commission
or architectural and site review board and the tree removal conforms with the landscape plans of
those developments.”      The City’s community development director reviews each permit
application in order to determine whether to grant, conditionally grant, or deny the permit.

Approval may only be granted if one or more of the following findings are made:

A. “The tree:

   1. Is diseased;
   2. Could adversely affect the general public health and safety,
   3. Could cause substantial damage,
   4. Is a public nuisance,
   5. Is in danger of falling,
   6. Is too closely located to existing structures,
   7. All practical design alternatives for site layout have been exhausted without being able to
      design around the tree(s), etc.,
   8. Interferes with utility service,
   9. Acts as a host for a plant which is parasitic to another species of tree which is in danger
      of being infested or exterminated by the parasite,
   10. Is a substantial fire hazard,
   11. Tree removal is necessary for the continuing agricultural use of the property, or
   12. Will be replaced by plantings approved by the community development director, unless
       special conditions indicate otherwise;

B. The required action is necessary:

   1. To utilize the property in a manner which is of greater public value than any
      environmental degradation caused by the action, or

   2. To allow reasonable economic or other enjoyment of the property.” (Morgan Hill
      Municipal Code 12.32.070 Permit-Approval-Criteria)

Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan (SCVHP).

Currently, the majority of the proposed development occurs within area categorized by the
SCVHP as “Rural Development Not Covered” (Figure 2-5 of the SCVHP), which means that the
area with that designation is not subject to the requirements or provisions of the SCVHP.
However, the project, which includes annexation into the City of Morgan Hill and adjustment of
the Urban Service Area to cover the development area, would require that the category for the
project area be changed to “Urban Development Equal to or Greater than 2 Acres is Covered,” a
designation that would require the project to comply with the SCVHP. It is assumed that this
change in categorization would be processed by the City of Morgan Hill upon annexation.
Therefore, the proposed project is assumed to be subject to provisions and requirements the
SCVHP as proposed. The following is a summary of the provisions and requirements of the
SCVHP.

Six local partners (the County of Santa Clara, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority;
Santa Clara Valley Water District; and the Cities of San Jose, Gilroy, and Morgan Hill) and two
wildlife agencies (the CDFW and the USFWS) prepared and adopted this multi-species habitat
conservation plan, which primarily covers southern Santa Clara County, as well as the City of
San Jose with the exception of the bayland areas. The SCVHP addresses conservation of listed
species and species that are likely to become listed during the plan's 50-year permit term,
including take-authorization, mitigation, and conservation. The eighteen covered species include
nine plants and nine animals, including, for example, the western burrowing owl and the
California tiger salamander. In general, the SCVHP is a fee-based program aimed at providing
regulatory compliance for impacts to these species and protected habitats and for the regional
conservation of protected species and habitats.

The SCVHP provides for the option of protecting conservation lands in lieu of fees; however, the
specifics of the process for this option have not yet been determined. Land in lieu of fees may
include lands coordinated with the County Parks, Open Space Authority, or other organization.
If approved by the Implementing Entity, land in lieu of fees will become part of the Reserve
System under the SCVHP once success criteria have been met (for restoration projects). Off-site
conservation lands in lieu of fee may be acceptable if the Implementing Entity, CDFW, and


                                                  34
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                   PN 1617-02

USFWS approve the proposed conservation lands. Fees for management of the in lieu lands
would still be required.

Fees. Funding sources for the SCVHP include development fees based on land cover types, fees
charged based on the occurrence of certain species and sensitive habitat types such as serpentine
habitats, and fees based on the number of vehicle trips the project is anticipated to add to the
baseline conditions on an annual basis. Chapter 9 of the SCVHP describes fees that may be
required by each project.

Fees are generally calculated based on the size and planned usage of the property related to the
proposed project. For projects occurring on properties that are 10 acres or greater, the fees are
calculated based on the development area for the project plus a 50-foot buffer around permanent
impacts and a 10-foot buffer around temporary impacts (e.g., underground utility construction
that results in restoration of surface to pre-project conditions). For permanent impacts, the
acreage would be multiplied by the project’s Land Cover Fee Zone classification as defined in
the SCVHP.          Properties that contain sensitive species habitats and/or sensitive habitat
communities that are covered by the SCVHP and that would be impacted by the project would
also be subject to species and/or sensitive habitat fee surcharges based on the acreages of impact.
Fees for projects less than 10 acres do not pertain to this project.

Other than acreage based fees, the SCVHP also includes nitrogen-deposition fees, for diffuse
impacts to habitats from increased nitrogen levels resulting from particular projects.         The
nitrogen deposition fee is related to the number of vehicle trips or single family units generated
by a project. Specifically, the nitrogen deposition fee would be required at $3.98 for each
projected new vehicle trip generated as a result of the project and/or $37.57 for each new
residential unit (based on the June 2014 rates).

Conditions on Covered Activities. The SCVHP provides several conditions for covered activities
under the SCVHP.

Potentially applicable conditions for this project can be found in Chapter 6 of the SCVHP and
are listed below:

As a result of a project design including annexation into the City of Morgan Hill and adjustment
of the USA to include the development area, the project is expected to be subject to all relevant
requirements and provisions of the SCVHP.

City of Morgan Hill Burrowing Owl Mitigation Plan.

Since the adoption of the City of Morgan Hill Burrowing Owl Mitigation Plan (2003; Burrowing
Owl Plan), the burrowing owl plan has provided a mechanism to conserve suitable burrowing
owl habitat by assessing a fee on all new development within the City. This system spreads owl
mitigation costs across development projects due to the philosophy that owls are impacted by the
loss in foraging habitat and potential breeding habitat, not just active breeding habitat.
Therefore, every new development project in Morgan Hill is subject to a burrowing owl fee.
This fee is levied on residential development per dwelling unit and on commercial/industrial
development per acre. The fee for residential development is collected at the time of recordation
of the subdivision map. The fee for commercial/industrial development is collected at the time
of building-permit issuance. The burrowing owl plan meets the requirements of CEQA.

3.3     IMPACTS AND MITIGATIONS SPECIFIC TO THE PROJECT SITE

As described in Section 1.1, the proposed project includes planned development within
approximately 20 acres of the study area. This includes development of 54 new residential units
and associated residential streets. The remaining 32 acres are proposed to be annexed into the
City of Morgan Hill and maintained as open space. The potential impacts and mitigations to
sensitive biological resources of the area resulting from development of the residential units and
streets are discussed in the following sections.

3.3.1    Loss of Habitat for Special Status Plants

Potential Impacts. Forty special status vascular plant species are known to occur in the greater
project vicinity (Section 2.3; Table 2). Due to the fact that all of these species are considered to
be absent from the site or highly unlikely to occur, site development would have no effect on
regional populations of these species since the site provides no habitat for special status plants.
Therefore, state and federal laws protecting special status plants would not be relevant to
development of the site.

Mitigation. Mitigation measures are not warranted.

3.3.2    Loss of Habitat for Special Status Animals

Potential Impacts.     Seventeen (17) special status animal species occur, or once occurred,
regionally (Table 2). Of these, ten (10) species would be absent or unlikely to occur on the site
due to a lack of suitable habitat for these species. These species include the bay checkerspot
butterfly, California red-legged frog, western pond turtle, coast horned lizard, western snowy
plover, western burrowing owl, least Bell’s vireo, California yellow warbler, San Francisco
dusky-footed woodrat, and ringtail.

Of the remaining seven (7) special status animal species from Table 2, three (3) of the avian
species potentially occur more frequently as regular foragers or transients, but would not be
expected to nest on site. For these species future development would not pose a significant
impact on them as suitable foraging habitat is regionally abundant. These include the golden
eagle, black swift, and tricolored blackbird.


                                                   39
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                   PN 1617-02

The remaining special status animals, the California tiger salamander, white-tailed kite, pallid
bat, and American badger, potentially occur more frequently as regular foragers or for breeding.
Other than for the California tiger salamander and the western burrowing owl, project build-out
would, at most, result in a minimal reduction of foraging and/or breeding habitat available
regionally for these species. Potential impacts to individuals and habitat for the California tiger
salamander and burrowing owl is discussed in Section 3.3.3 and 3.3.5, respectively. Therefore,
the loss of habitat for the remaining species listed in Table 2 would be considered less than
significant.

Mitigation. Mitigation measures are not warranted (see sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.5 for discussions
specific to California tiger salamander and western burrowing owl, respectively).

3.3.3     Impacts to California Tiger Salamander.

Potential Impacts. Potentially suitable breeding habitat for California tiger salamander (CTS) is
present within the study area in the form of the evaporation basin that is fed by the off-site pond
and runoff from surrounding areas. In addition, the offsite pond, located to the west and uphill
form the evaporation basin, may provide more regular breeding habitat for CTS. As such, all
upland habitats of the study area support potentially suitable estivation habitat for CTS. As
proposed, development would include impacts to the evaporation basin. This species is presumed
present for this analysis. Therefore any impacts to the evaporation basin and upland habitats
would be considered significant impacts to CTS breeding and estivation habitats (respectively)
under CEQA.

The CTS is a covered species under the SCVHP (ICF International 2012), therefore, provisions
for this species are covered in the SCVHP. The SCVHP does not require preconstruction
surveys or salvage of CTS for projects within the SCVHP area. The project is in Fee Zone B
(Section 3.3.12); fees paid for this zone will fund conservation land and/or land management for
CTS through the SCVHP process. Payment of the SCVHP fees would reduce impacts to CTS a
less-than-significant effect.

Mitigation. To offset potential impacts to CTS the project applicant would be required to follow
all requirements regarding CTS including payment of SCVHP fees in accordance with the fee

zone that the development area covers. Section 3.3.12 describes the fee structure in greater
detail.

3.3.4     Impacts to Western Burrowing Owl.

Potential Impacts. There have been no known or documented occurrences of burrowing owls
within Morgan Hill for nearly a decade. According to the CNDDB (2014), historical sightings of
burrowing owls in Morgan Hill include an observation of an owl using an artificial burrow at El
Toro Elementary School in March 2003. Owls were previously observed on this same site in
1998, 2000, and 2001. Indirect evidence of burrowing owls (e.g., whitewash, feathers, and
pellets) was observed at the water tank facility immediately to the northwest of the site in August
2002. No burrowing owls have been observed on that site since. In addition to CNDDB records,
in February of 2007, an observation of a single burrowing owl was made at the San Pedro
Percolation Ponds. This owl stayed onsite several days and then moved on (Tony Eulo, 2007,
pers. comm.). There is no current evidence of nesting activity within the City’s sphere of
influence.

The site does not occur within modeled occupied habitat as shown in Fig. 5-11 of the SCVHP.
No direct or indirect evidence of burrowing owls was observed on the project site; however,
protocol level surveys have not been conducted. Burrowing owls are not expected to breed or
establish nests on the site, and impacts to burrowing owl habitat would be considered less than
significant.

While unlikely given the recent history of the last decade, it is possible for individuals to use the
site in the future it is due to their ability to fly over long distances. Construction activities could
result in harm to these birds (see “Nesting Raptors and Other Migratory Birds” below).

Mitigation. No mitigation measures are warranted. For impacts to individual burrowing owls,
see Section 3.3.5 “Nesting Raptors and Other Migratory Birds,” below.

3.3.5     Impacts to White-tailed Kite and Other Nesting Migratory Birds.

Potential Impacts. Tree and ground nesting species could be impacted as a result of project
buildout. The onsite trees provide suitable habitat for tree-nesting avian species, including the
white-tailed kite. The nest of a red-tailed hawk was observed within the oak woodlands of the

                                                  41
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                   PN 1617-02

site during the March 2012 survey. Ground-nesting species (e.g., burrowing owls, northern
harriers, and killdeer) may also establish nests on the site in the future. Site development near
suitable tree and/or ground nesting habitat (within 250 feet) or that directly impacts trees during
the avian nesting season (February 1 through August 31) could result in the abandonment of an
active nest. Site development could also impact a burrow being used by a burrowing owl during
the non-nesting season (September 1 through January 31), which could result in direct mortality
to a burrowing owl. Activities that result in the abandonment of active nests or direct mortality
to these birds would be considered a significant impact.

Mitigation. Site pre-construction surveys should be conducted during the breeding season (1
February through 31 August) for raptors and other migratory birds no more than two weeks prior
to the onset of ground disturbance between February and May and within 30 days of the onset of
construction from June through August.       Pre-construction surveys during the non-breeding
season are not necessary for tree-nesting raptors and migratory birds, as they are expected to
abandon their roosts during construction; however, pre-construction surveys should be conducted
during the non-breeding season for burrowing owls. Surveys should be conducted to incorporate
the recommendations of the CDFW’s Staff Report on Burrowing Owl Mitigation (2012). If the
target species are deemed absent from the area, then no mitigations are required, and
construction could occur within 14 or 30 days (depending on the timing of the survey) following
the survey(s).

If nesting raptors or other migratory birds are detected on or adjacent to the site during the
survey, a suitable construction-free buffer should be established around all active nests. The
precise dimension of the buffer (up to 250 feet) should be determined at that time and may vary
depending on location and species. The buffer areas should be enclosed with temporary fencing,
and construction equipment and workers should not enter the enclosed setback areas. Buffers
should remain in place for the duration of the breeding season or until it has been confirmed by a
qualified biologist that all chicks have fledged and are independent of their parents.
Implementation of these measures would mitigate impacts to nesting raptors and other migratory
birds to a less-than-significant level.

3.3.6    Impacts to Pallid Bats and Other Roosting Bats.

Potential Impacts. A number of bat species including, but not limited to the pallid bat may
forage on the site year-round or during migration. No potential roosting habitat would be
impacted as a result of project buildout. Conversion of grasslands to residential development
would result in a less-than-significant loss of foraging habitat for bats.

Mitigation. Mitigation measures are not warranted.

3.3.7    Impacts to American Badger.

Potential Impacts. Although American badger sign was not observed on the site during the
March 2012 or July 2014 surveys, badger burrows are present on the adjacent Edmundson water
tank site. It is likely that badgers could occur within the site that shares contiguous grassland
habitat with the site containing a badger burrow. Conversion of grasslands to urban development
would result in a less-than-significant loss of habitat for the American badger but may result in
harm or injury to individuals of this species, which would constitute a significant adverse impact.

Mitigation. Mitigation is warranted for the American badger.

•   Mitigation Measure 3.3.7a: Pre-construction surveys should be conducted by a qualified
    biologist within 30 days of the onset of site disturbances to determine the presence or
    absence of badgers in the development footprint. If an active badger den is identified during
    pre-construction surveys within or immediately adjacent to the construction envelope, a
    construction-free buffer of up to 300 ft. should be established around the den. Because
    badgers are known to use multiple burrows in a breeding burrow complex, a biological
    monitor should be present onsite during construction activities to ensure the buffer is
    adequate to avoid direct impact to individuals or nest abandonment. The monitor would be
    necessary onsite until it is determined that young are of an independent age and construction
    activities would not harm individual badgers.
•   Mitigation Measure 3.3.7b: Once it has been determined that badgers have vacated the site,
    the burrows can be collapsed or excavated, and ground disturbance can proceed.

3.3.8    Impacts to Riparian Habitats including Protected Wetlands

Potential Impacts. A portion of the area of proposed development contains man-made features
that appear to be inundated during periods of high precipitation, including drainage ditched and
an evaporation/detention basin.       These features include a narrow, linear drainage ditch,
approximately 240 feet long, that carries water from an onsite culvert toward Sunset Avenue


                                                  43
Oak Meadow Plaza BE                                                                   PN 1617-02

(Figure 3), a small non-wetland channel that is approximately 75 feet long, and an
evaporation/detention basin that is approximately 0.3 acres in extent.        The drainages and
evaporation basin, which appear to have been created in upland habitats, contain weedy non-
native vegetation, including many ruderal, non-native grasses and forbs typical of the
surrounding grassland habitat. There is no riparian habitat associated with any of these features.
Given these conditions, the biological functions and values would be minimal for local wildlife,
but it may provide a seasonal water source. However, while undocumented, it is possible that
the basin serves as breeding habitat for CTS (Section 3.3.3), a species that has been historically
documented as occurring within the site’s vicinity. The loss of the drain features resulting from
project buildout would be considered a less-than-significant effect under CEQA. However, due
to the potential use of the feature by CTS and its marginal function as an ephemeral pond for
some local wildlife, the loss of the evaporation/detention basin would be considered a significant
effect.

In addition, some or all of these features may be waters of the U.S. and waters of the State and,
therefore, considered jurisdictional by the USACE and the RWQCB.              As such, filling of
jurisdictional wetlands and drainages would require permits from the USACE and RWQCB. At
this time a formal wetland delineation of the study area has not been conducted. Such a study
would need to be conducted and submitted to the USACE for verification of onsite wetland
habitats.

Mitigation. While filling of the onsite drainage features resulting from project buildout would
not be considered a significant effect under CEQA, filling of the evaporation/detention basin is a
significant effect. Based on the proposed project, avoidance of impacts to this feature is not
feasible; therefore, mitigation is warranted.

The SCVHP provides coverage for impacts to wetland habitats. The SCVHP implementing
entity may require mitigation for impacts to the evaporation/detention basin in the form of fees to
be assessed during the SCVHP application process. Fees for ponds are currently assessed at
$156,755 per acre under the SCVHP.            Payment of SCVHP fees would reduce impacts to
wetlands to a less-than-significant effect.

In addition, the project would be required to comply with all regulations related to impacts to the
evaporation/detention basin and the drainage features of the site. At the onset of site planning, a
formal wetland delineation should be completed by a qualified wetland biologist and submitted
to the USACE for verification to determine which features of the site are considered to be
jurisdictional. If jurisdictional habitats are identified and verified by the USACE, the project
proponents may then be required to obtain a Section 404 Clean Water Act permit from the
USACE and Section 401 water quality certification from the RWQCB. These permits would
require mitigation for impacts to these features including creation of similar or higher quality
habitat at a minimum of a 1:1 loss:creation ratio; or purchase of mitigation bank credits at a
minimum 1:1 ratio at an approved mitigation bank. At this time, the USACE and RWQCB do
not provide coverage of impacts through the SCVHP; therefore, mitigations related to these
agency permits would be in addition to payment of SCVHP fees.

3.3.9    Loss of Habitat for Native Wildlife

Potential Impacts. None of the biotic habitats onsite are considered sensitive, however, the wet
features of the study area may provide added value of the site to native wildlife such as the
California tiger salamander and pacific tree frog. The remainder of the study area consists of
grazed annual grassland and oak woodland, which provide high-quality habitat for most species,
and a small eucalyptus grove and developed habitats which provides only low-quality habitat for
most species. Due to the large amount of proposed open space, the loss of habitat for native
wildlife resulting from the proposed project would constitute a less-than-significant impact.

Mitigation. Mitigation measures are not warranted.

3.3.10   Interference with the Movement of Native Wildlife

Potential Impacts. The contiguous grasslands of the site may facilitate the movement of
wildlife through the region, from the hills to the west of the site and through the project site
itself, however, there is development to the north, south, and east, so this property does not
function as an important movement corridor for native wildlife.         Site development is not
expected to have a significant effect on home range and dispersal movements of native wildlife
that may occur in the region. Therefore, the project will result in a less-than-significant impact
on the movements of native wildlife.

Mitigation. Mitigation measures are not warranted.

3.3.11   Degradation of Water Quality in Seasonal Drainages and Downstream Waters

Potential Impacts.     Eventual site development can result in soils being left barren in the
development footprint. Additionally, extensive grading often leaves the soils of construction
zones barren of vegetation and, therefore, vulnerable to erosion. Eroded soil can be carried as
sediment in seasonal creeks to be deposited in creek beds and adjacent wetlands. However, the
development envelope for the Sunset Property on the project site is nearly level. Therefore, the
potential for erosion and the degradation of water quality in off-site waters is small.

Furthermore, the applicant is expected to comply with the provisions of a City of Morgan Hill
grading permit, including standard erosion control measures that employ best management
practices (BMPs). Compliance with the permit(s) should result in no impact to water quality in
seasonal creeks and downstream waters from the proposed project and should not result in the
deposition of pollutants and sediments in sensitive riparian and wetland habitats.

Mitigation. Mitigation measures are not warranted.

3.3.12   Conflicts with Local Policies or Ordinances.

Potential Impacts. Three local policies related to the biological resources of the site are
relevant to the project area (Section 3.2.6). These include a tree ordinance, Morgan Hill’s
burrowing owl plan, and a county-wide habitat conservation plan (i.e., the SCVHP). The project
applicant would need to ensure that the project conforms to all three to ensure there is no effect
under CEQA.

Tree ordinance. Few trees occur within the footprint of the project’s proposed development
area, all of which occur along Sunset Avenue. All of these trees are likely to be impacted as a
result of project buildout. The removal of trees that are 40-inches in diameter (dbh) for non-
indigenous species or 18-inches in diameter for native species measured at 4.5 feet above the
natural grade, or above the lowest branch would require compliance with the City’s tree
ordinance. Several of the trees of the site subject to removal do not meet the size requirements
of the ordinance, but, for those that do, a permit and suitable mitigation would be required for
their removal to ensure conformance with the City’s tree ordinance.

City of Morgan Hill Burrowing Owl Mitigation Plan. The City’s burrowing owl plan requires
payment of construction fees and preconstruction surveys for new development (Section 3.2.6).
To ensure conformance with this plan mitigations identified in mitigation measure 3.3.12c would
need to be followed.

Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan. As described above (Section 3.2.6), once annexed into the
City of Morgan Hill the proposed project will be subject to the SCVHP; therefore, fees and other
conditions of the SCVHP pertain to the project. To ensure conformance with the SCVHP all
mitigations described in mitigation measure 3.3.12c would need to be followed.

Mitigation.     The applicant is required to implement the following mitigation measures to
ensure that the project is conforms to local policies and ordinances.

Mitigation Measure 3.3.12a: Protected trees removed as a result of future development would
require appropriate tree replacement mitigation as determined by the City of Morgan Hill’s
planning department to reduce impacts resulting from tree removal to a less-than-significant
level. At this time, the planning department may accept payment of fees in accordance with the
SCVHP as suitable mitigation for loss of trees. If the City does not accept payment of SCVHP
fees as mitigation for tree loss, all trees removed or fatally damaged as a result of project
buildout and which are designated as protected trees by the City’s municipal code will require
replacement plantings at suitable replacement-to-loss ratios to be determined by the City of
Morgan Hill’s community development director. The City of Morgan Hill does not maintain
standard ratios for replacement trees required for removed trees. Table 3 provides a set of
replacement ratios that would adequately mitigate for trees that are removed or fatally wounded
as a result of project buildout. The City’s community development director would be the final
arbiter of actual tree replacement requirements.

All removed/fatally damaged trees that are protected by the City should be replaced with
equivalent species. The location of replacement trees offsite would have to be approved by the
City’s community development director. Replacement plantings should be completed generally
between November and January of the year, and they should be planted within 2 years of the
completion of the proposed project.

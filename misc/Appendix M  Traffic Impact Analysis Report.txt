Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed California
Flats Solar Project located in the unincorporated area of southern Monterey County, California.
The proposed project consists of the construction and operations of an approximately 280
Mega-Watt (MW) solar Project. Project construction is scheduled to commence in the fourth
quarter of 2014 and continue over a 12 to 18 month timeline with construction activity occurring
during the week from Monday through Friday.

The impacts of the proposed Project to the surrounding transportation system were evaluated
following the guidelines of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The
operations at the three study intersections and seven roadway segments were evaluated with
level of service calculations for Existing and Existing + Project Construction Phase.

Project Study Area

This analysis included the following three study intersections and roadway segments:

Study Intersections:

   1. SR 41 / Private Access Road (Project Driveway)
   2. SR 41 / SR 46
   3. Cholame Valley Road / SR 41 / 46

Roadway Segments:

    1.   SR 41 between SR 46 / Private Access Road
    2.   SR 41 between Private Access Road / SR 33
    3.   SR 46 between SR 41 / SR 33
    4.   SR 46 between SR 41 / West Centre Street
    5.   SR 46 between West Centre Street / Estrella Road
    6.   SR 46 between Estrella Road / Branch Road
    7.   SR 46 between Branch Road / U.S. Highway 101

Development Scenarios

The study analyzed traffic conditions under the following development scenarios:

        Existing Weekday (Monday through Thursday) Traffic Conditions

Project Trip Estimates

The California Flats Solar Project is estimated to generated 10 new AM and 10 new PM peak-
hour trips and 28 daily trips during the Project’s long term operations and maintenance phase.
The Project Construction Phase is estimated to generate 88 new trips during both the AM and
PM peak-hour trips and 263 daily trips.

Project Operations Phase traffic will be less compared to the Project Construction Phase.
Potential Operations Phase Project impacts will also be significantly less. Impacts due to the
Project Construction Phase will be temporary and occur only during the duration of Project
construction.

Applicant Proposed Project Measures to Alleviate Potential Traffic Impacts

The Project will implement traffic management measures that will alleviate potential impacts of
construction traffic on the surrounding transportation network. These measures include the
following:

      The implementation of a Shuttle program that will transport 95% of the total construction
       workforce to/from the Project site each day. Participation in the shuttle program will be a
       mandatory condition of employment.
      The Project will implement a permit system to restrict on-site vehicle access and parking
       to only allow specific vehicles to access the Project site.
      Turn lane and acceleration/deceleration lane improvements on SR 41 at the Project
       access driveway intersection.
      The Project may take advantage of the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments
       rideshare program to assist in matching employees for carpools
      The majority of deliveries to the Project site will be scheduled to occur during off-peak
       hours.

Intersection and Roadway Segment Impacts

Existing Plus Project Construction Phase Conditions

For Existing Plus Project Construction Phase conditions the roadway segment of SR 46 from
West Centre Street to Branch road will operate at an unacceptable LOS E. This roadway
segment is currently under construction and will be expanded from two lanes to four lanes from
West Centre Street to Branch Road. After completion of construction this segment will operate
at an acceptable LOS A.

The intersection of SR 41 / SR 46 will operate at an overall LOS A however the southbound left
will operate at an unacceptable LOS F during Friday PM peak hour conditions. This is a
significant impact.

Existing Plus Project Operations Phase Conditions

The intersection of SR 41 / SR 46 will operate at an overall LOS A, however the southbound left
will continue to operate at an unacceptable LOS F during the Friday PM peak hour conditions
under Existing Plus Project Operations Phase. The Project Operations Phase will add three
trips to this movement during the Friday PM peak hour and would be imperceptible.

Cumulative + Project Operations Phase Conditions

The proposed California Flats Solar Project will consist of 8 to 10 permanent employees during
the Project Operations Phase that will gain access to/from the Project site via personal vehicles.
The addition of the Project Operation Phase traffic will be insignificant. The project will add 28
daily trips (10 in the AM peak hour and 10 in the PM peak hour) to the roadway network. The
permanent employees are not projected to have significant LOS and/or delay impacts to the
adjacent roadway. Therefore, Project Operation Phase conditions are projected to be similar to
Existing conditions with project impacts less critical than under Project Construction Phase
conditions. Thus, a quantitative Project Operations Phase conditions analysis is not warranted.

In addition, Caltrans has approved and funded and is widening additional sections of SR 46. In
addition, Caltrans expects that additional funding will be available to construct the Whitley 2B,
the Cholame, the SR 41 / SR 46 interchange (the Wye) and Antelope Grade in 2018. Access to
the Ranch and the project will be relocated The project traffic will not impact the proposed
future improvements to the SR 46, SR 41 and the SR 41/SR 46 interchange.

1.1       Project Description

The proposed project site is located north of SR 41 and SR 46, and approximately 14 miles
northeast of the community of Shandon. Exhibit 1 presents the regional project location and
Exhibit 2 presents the project location with respect to the surrounding transportation system.

The California Flats Solar Project consists of a 280 Megawatt (“MW”) alternating current (AC)
photovoltaic (“PV”) solar project. The Project is located on an approximately 2,675-acre site in
southeastern Monterey County, California, near the borders of Monterey County, San Luis
Obispo County, Kings County, and Fresno County. The proposed project will include solar
arrays, related structures, electrical equipment and infrastructure improvements, including two
sub-stations and switching station that will provide an interconnect to the Pacific Gas & Electric
Company (PG&E) owned Morro Bay – Gates 230 (kV) transmission line, which currently
transects the project site, and an operations and maintenance (O&M) facility. Project
improvements will be located on approximately 1,900 acres of the site. Primary access to the
Project site will be provided from an existing private driveway off of California State Route (SR)
41, and emergency access also will be available from Turkey Flat Road. A complete
description of the proposed project is provided in the California Flats Solar Project, Project
Description, Denise Duffy & Associates, Inc. (July 2012).

Currently, the project site consists of cattle ranch grazing land accessible from Turkey Flat Road
and SR 41. Regional access from SR 41/46 is established via Cholame Valley Road to Turkey
Flat Road. The existing access gates are being used by the ranch for cattle ranching
operations. There are currently 10 to 20 daily trips going to and from the land that are
associated with typical ranch operations and are not expected to change.

To determine potential significant impacts related to the proposed project, the following existing
intersections and roadway segments were selected for analysis based on the Project’s potential
impacts, local area knowledge, and project vicinity. All intersections were analyzed under
current weekday (Monday through Thursday), and Friday, AM and PM peak hour traffic
conditions. Roadway segments were analyzed based upon average daily traffic (ADT) on each
of the study segments.

This analysis included the following three study intersections and roadway segments:

Study Intersections:

      1. SR 41 & Private Access Road (Project Driveway)
      2. SR 41 / SR 46
      3. Cholame Valley Road / SR 41/46

Roadway Segments:

      1.   SR 41 between SR 46 / Private Access Road
      2.   SR 41 between Private Access Road / SR 33
      3.   SR 46 between SR 41 / SR 33
      4.   SR 46 between SR 41 / West Centre Street
      5.   SR 46 between West Centre Street / Estrella Road
      6.   SR 46 between Estrella Road / Branch Road
      7.   SR 46 between Branch Road / U.S. Highway 101

1.2        Study Scenarios

The following scenarios were evaluated to provide for a baseline for determining Project related
impacts:

          Existing Weekday (Monday – Thursday) Traffic Conditions: Existing Weekday
           Conditions represents existing weekday or Monday through Thursday peak-hour traffic
           volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from
           manual peak hour traffic counts at the study intersections.

          Exiting Friday Traffic Conditions: Existing Friday Conditions represents the existing
           Friday peak hour traffic volumes on the existing roadway network. Friday peak hour
           traffic volumes were obtained from recent transportation and circulation studies
           completed within the project vicinity.

         Existing Weekday (Monday – Thursday) Plus Project Construction Phase
          Conditions: Existing Weekday Plus Project Construction Phase conditions represents
          the existing weekday peak hour traffic plus trips associated with the construction of the
          proposed California Flats Solar Project.

         Existing Friday Plus Project Construction Phase Conditions: Existing Friday Plus
          Project Construction Phase conditions represents the existing Friday peak hour traffic
          plus trips associated with the construction of the proposed California Flats Solar Project.

         Cumulative Plus Project Operations Phase Conditions: Qualitative analysis of
          Project Operations Phase Plus Existing Conditions was conducted that evaluates the
          proposed project operation phase traffic plus Existing Conditions traffic volumes. Project
          Operations Phase Conditions represents the project’s long term operations phase. Due
          to the very limited traffic associated with the Operations Phase of the project (28 ADT), a
          quantitative “Project Operations Phase” conditions analysis is not warranted.

1.3       Trip Generation

Trip generation for Project Construction Phase and Project Operations Phase was developed
using information provided by the project applicant.

1.4       Traffic Operations Methodologies

The methodologies outlined in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) were used to perform
the operational analysis and provide quantitative levels of services (LOS). The Synchro 7.0
software program was used to evaluate intersection level of service operations. These
methodologies are consistent with Caltrans standards for traffic analysis.

Unsignalized Intersections

Intersection traffic flow operations are evaluated using a level of service (LOS) concept.
Intersections are rated based on a grading scale of “LOS A” through “LOS F” with “LOS A”
representing free flowing conditions and “LOS F” representing oversaturated conditions where
traffic flows exceed design capacity, resulting in long queues and delays. For one and two-way
stop controlled intersections, the operating efficiency of vehicle movements that must yield to
through movements are analyzed. The level of service of vehicle movements on the controlled
approaches is based on the distribution of gaps in the major street traffic stream and on driver
judgment in selecting gaps. Table 1 shows the relationship between vehicle delay and level of
service for two-way stop controlled intersections. The 2000 HCM calculations the level of
service of the minor street approaches. Using this data, an overall intersection level of service
was calculated. Both are reported in this study because traffic on the minor street approaches
has the lowest priority of right-of-way at the intersection and is the most critical in terms of delay.
Generally, an LOS operation on the side street approach is the threshold that warrants
improvements.

1.5      Regulatory Setting & Level of Service (LOS) Standards

Caltrans has jurisdiction of all state maintained facilities including SR 41 and SR 46. Caltrans
strives to maintain operations at the LOS C/D threshold on all of its facilities. LOS C is
acceptable in all cases and LOS D is acceptable on a case-by-case basis. Any modifications to
facilities within the Caltrans right-of-way must be approved by the State.

The Transportation Concept Report (TCR) for SR 46 states that LOS C is considered
acceptable for the segment of SR 46 from Branch Road to the San Luis Obispo/Kern County
Line.

1.6      Significance Criteria

All study area intersections and roadway segments are state highway facilities and are under
the jurisdiction of Caltrans. The standards of significance criteria apply to project traffic being
added to roadways operating at an LOS that does not meet the required standard of the
applicable agency. The following the significance standard for Caltrans:

The Caltrans Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (Caltrans 2002) defines
significant impacts to occur when:

      1. The addition of project traffic causes roadway operations to degrade from an acceptable
         level (LOS C or better) to an unacceptable (LOS D or worse) level, or

2. Existing Conditions
This chapter presents a description of the existing roadway network, traffic volumes, intersection
and roadway segment operations analysis, and an overview of traffic flow within the study area.

2.1    Existing Roadway Network

Regional north-south freeway access is provided via Interstate 5 (I-5) located to the east of the
site and via US 101 located to the west of the site in the City of Paso Robles. East-west access
is provided via SR 46 and SR 41. SR 46 is a major east-west facility that extends from SR 1
through Paso Robles and continues east to I-5 and the Central Valley. In the immediate vicinity
of the site, SR 46 contains one lane in each direction. SR 41 is another east-west / north-south
facility that also extends from SR 1 to the west and extends northeast towards the I-5, the
Central Valley and the Sierras. SR 41 intersects SR 46 immediately east of the Cholame Valley
Road/SR 46 intersection.

Cholame Valley Road is a two-lane north-south County Road located within Monterey and San
Luis Obispo counties that extends north from the intersection of SR 41/46. Cholame Road
consists of no shoulders and traverses rolling terrain with moderate grades and sections of
sharp turns.

Turkey Flat Road is a two-lane east-west rural road that extends for approximately four miles
between Cholame Valley Road and a gated entry at the western border of the project site.
Turkey Flat Road varies in width between 14 and 24 feet and consists of windy curves and
undulating grades throughout.

State Route 41 (SR 41) is a north-south state highway that provides a regional connection
between Atascadero in the south to King and Fresno counties in the northeast. SR 41 is
designated as a state STAA truck route.

State Route 46 (SR 46) is a major east-west state highway that provides a critical connection
between the Central Coast region (SR 1, US 101) and the Central Valley and Southern
California region via Interstate 5 and SR 99. Regionally, SR 46 begins near Cambria in San
Luis Obispo County and connects with Interstate 5 at Lost Hills in Kern County. SR 46 is
designated as a state STAA Truck Route and carries interregional and regional traffic as well as
local rural and urban traffic.

SR 46 is currently a two lane highway east of Airport Road with a posted speed limit of 55 miles
per hour (MPH). The section west of Airport Road is a four lane expressway facility. SR 46
serves as the principal regional east-west commute route as well as an inter-regional truck
route. The segment east of the US 101 interchange in Paso Robles is known to be congested
on Friday’s and weekends, as well as during seasonal travel periods. Per the State Route 46
Concept Report (July 2008), SR 46 is recommended to be improved (widened) to a 4-lane
expressway from West Centre Street to the four lane expressway section at Branch Road.
Construction of this improvement is currently underway.

U.S. Highway 101 (US-101) is a regional roadway that traverses through Monterey and San
Luis Obispo counties, continuing north to San Francisco and south to Los Angeles. In the
vicinity of the project, US 101 is a four-lane roadway with an interchange with SR 46 East.

Interstate 5 (I-5) is a north-south freeway that runs the length of California between the Mexico
border and the Oregon border. In the project area, I-5 is a four lane freeway with interchanges
at SR 41 and SR 46.

Intersections:

   1. SR 41 / Private Access Road intersection is an uncontrolled three legged “T”
      intersection. SR 41 is uncontrolled in both the northbound and southbound directions.
      The Private Drive is currently uncontrolled and access is restricted with a locked cattle
      gate.

   2.    SR 41 / SR 46 intersection is a “T” intersection that is one-way stop controlled in the
        southbound left direction. The SR 41 southbound right turn lane is yield controlled
        merge lane where vehicles traveling to westbound SR 46 must yield to westbound SR
        46 traffic. In the westbound direction, SR 46 has a left turn pocket with deceleration lane
        and uncontrolled through lane. The eastbound approach of SR 46 consists of
        uncontrolled shared through-right movement and includes a channelized right turn exit
        lane that merges with traffic making the eastbound left onto northbound SR 41.

   3. Cholame Valley Road / SR41/46 is a three legged “T” intersection is located
      approximately 700 feet to the west of SR 41/46 and 200 feet west of the gore point of SR
      41 merge lane with westbound SR 46. The intersection is one-way stop control in the
      southbound direction on Cholame Valley Road. SR 41/46 consists of a single through
      lane in the westbound direction. The eastbound direction consists of a left turn pocket
      and single through lane.

A summary of existing intersection geometry is shown in Exhibit 3.

2.2    Alternative Transportation Network: Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Transit
Facilities

Due to the rural nature of the area, there were no pedestrian and/or bicycle activities observed
within the vicinity of the study area. None of the project roadways are designated as existing or
proposed future bike routes and no sidewalks or trail facilities exist along the study roadway
segments.

There are no transit or railroad facilities within the vicinity of the project study area.

2.3     Existing Conditions Traffic Volumes

Traffic counts were collected on Wednesday March 7, 2012 from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM in the
morning period and 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM during the evening hours at Intersections #2 and #3.
Volumes at Intersection #1 were extrapolated from Intersection #2 data. Turning movements at
Intersection #1 were based on typical ranch operations. The AM peak hour occurred between
8:00 AM and 9:00 AM and the PM peak hour between 4:35 PM and 5:35 PM. Truck
classification counts were recorded during the peak hours and are incorporated into the LOS
analysis by turning movement. Exhibit 4 shows Existing Weekday (Monday – Thursday) peak
hour traffic volumes.

Friday peak hour conditions were also analyzed due to significant seasonal and weekend traffic
along SR 46. Intersection traffic counts for the Friday AM and PM peak were obtained from the
Shandon Community Plan Traffic Impact Analysis (prepared by Wood Rodgers, February 2010).
The Friday peak hour reflects the period with heaviest traffic volumes on an average Friday.
Exhibit 5 shows Existing Friday peak hour traffic volumes.

Average Daily Traffic (ADT) count data for the study roadway segments was obtained from the
Caltrans Traffic Data Branch (http://traffic-counts.dot.ca.gov/). The ADT traffic volumes on
Caltrans facilities were collected during 2010.

2.4      Existing Conditions Roadway Segment LOS Analysis

The project study area roadway segments were analyzed under the existing roadway capacity
configuration using the ADT-based LOS thresholds presented in Table 2. The results of this
analysis are presented in Table 3 below. As shown, the roadway segment of SR 46 between
SR 41 and Branch Road currently operates at an unacceptable LOS E on an ADT basis.

2.5      Existing Conditions Intersection LOS Analysis

The Synchro analysis software was used to determine the intersection LOS for weekday and
Friday AM and PM peak hours at each of the study intersections within the project area. The
results of these analyses for the three study intersections are summarized in Table 4.

All intersections operate at an acceptable LOS during both Weekday Peak and Friday Peak
AM/PM peak hours except for the intersection of SR 41 / 46. The intersection of SR 41 / 46
operates at an acceptable overall LOS A during all peak hours, however the southbound left
movement operates at an unacceptable LOS F during Friday PM peak hour conditions.

The overall accident rate for intersections of SR 41 / Private Access Road and Cholame Valley
Road / SR 41/46 are below the statewide average accident rate. The intersection of SR 41 / SR
46 is more than two times the statewide average. All traffic collisions at the SR 41 / SR 46 were
recorded as broadside collisions resulting from vehicles turning left from the eastbound
approach into the westbound through lane.

Long-range improvements have been identified to reconfigure the SR 41/SR 46 intersection to
address long-term capacity and safety concerns (Caltrans District 5, Route Corridor
Improvement Study, EA/FONSI/EIR May 2006).

4. Existing Plus Project Construction Phase
Conditions
This chapter describes the impacts associated with the proposed California Flats Solar Project
Construction and Operational phases. The methodology used to develop the project traffic
volumes and to evaluate roadway operations under these scenarios is described below.

4.1       Trip Generation

Trip generation for the proposed California Flats Solar Project was developed for the
construction and operation phases of the project using information from similar solar project
sites including the Centinela, Silverleaf, and Kern County Solar projects.

Project Construction Phase Trip Generation:

The Project Construction Phase is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2014 with a
total construction phase duration of approximately 12 to 18 months. For traffic analysis
purposes this analysis assumes the shortest construction period possible of 12 months; thus a
worst case scenario in regards to number of employees, deliveries and project trip generation.
A construction period longer than 12 months will yield lower daily construction traffic.

The trip generation of the Project Construction Phase is estimated to represent the equivalent of
constructing an average of 5.5 Mega Watt (MW) panels per week and assumes a maximum
workforce of 816 construction employees per day. The project will implement a shuttle service
that will transport 95% of the total construction workforce to and from the project site each day.
The remaining 5% of construction workers will be issued permits that will allow them to drive
personal vehicles to the site each day. The project construction phase will include the following
type of vehicle trips:

         Construction workforce (95%) commute trips via shuttle bus (Heavy Vehicles)
         Construction workforce (5%) commute trips via personal vehicles
         Equipment Deliveries (Heavy Vehicles)
         Employee Food Deliveries (Heavy Vehicles)
         Excavation, Debris, Concrete and Material Hauling (Heavy Vehicles)

The following discussion uses a 12-month construction schedule: The total construction
workforce will generate 34 employee shuttle trips (heavy vehicles) per day and 93 personal
vehicle trips per day, including personal trips for five night shift employees, who arrive outside of
the AM and PM peak hours. A total of 136 non-workforce trips including 74 daily equipment
deliveries, 34 food delivery trips, and 28 excavation/debris/material hauling trips are expected
per day.

Appendix D provides detail of project trips generated by delivery, construction, excavation, and
material hauling trips during the Project Construction phase. A summary of the trip generation

Notes:
*Based upon peak construction phase of a 280 Megawatt Facility over a 12-month construction period. If the project construction
period lasts for longer than 12-months, the number of peak hour trips would be slightly lower.
*Project Construction Phase trip generation is based upon a total workforce of 816 employees.
* Personal Vehicles are FHWA Class 1 - 3 vehicles. Heavy vehicles are FHWA Class 4 and above vehicles.
*Estimated number of shuttle bus trips is based upon 95% of employees transported to the site via shuttle with a single bus capacity
of 46 passengers. Construction employees will be required to utilize the shuttle program as a condition of their employment.




As discussed above, this report assumes that a shuttle service will transport the construction
workforce to and from the project site. Of the entire workforce, 5% of the total construction
workforce (27 to 41 employees depending on the construction schedule) will be permitted to
drive personal vehicles to the project site. The remaining 95% of the total construction workforce
(541 - 775 employees, depending on the construction schedule) will be mandated as a condition
of their employment to ride employee shuttle buses from the designated employee shuttle park
and ride locations. Each location will provide sufficient parking for the construction workforce.
One shuttle park and ride lot will be located west of the site on SR 46 in Paso Robles, the other
park and ride lot will be located northeast of the project site approximately at the intersection of
SR 41 and SR 33. Based upon peak workforce levels and a 12-month construction schedule, a
maximum of 17 shuttle buses with a capacity of 46 passengers per bus will transport employees
to and from the project site each day. The number of shuttle buses per day will vary throughout
construction depending upon the size of the construction workforce.



August 5, 2013                                                                                                          Page | 22

                                                           California Flats Solar Project Traffic Analysis Report

The construction workforce is expected to arrive at the project site between 6:00 AM and 7:00
AM and leave the site between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM for a majority of the year. During the
summer months, construction hours will begin and end at earlier times due to hot weather
conditions. Employees will remain on the site during lunch breaks and will either bring their own
lunches or food trucks may deliver lunches to the site. This analysis assumes that food trucks
will deliver food to the site each day and presents a worst case scenario in regards to project
trip generation. Construction staff is expected to arrive one hour before the AM peak hour of the
study area roadways thus this analysis presents a conservative or worst case analysis of
Construction Phase Project conditions during the AM peak hour. Five night shift employees are
anticipated to arrive/leave the project site outside of the AM and PM peak hours; thus, these
employee trips are reflected in the daily project trip generation, but are not included in the peak
hour project trip totals. Night shift employees are also excluded when estimating the number of
food trucks required at the site each day.

Non-workforce Construction Phase trips will consist of solar panel equipment deliveries,
employee food deliveries, excavation, debris and material hauling trips and miscellaneous
deliveries. The size of the trucks is anticipated to be a California Legal Truck Tractor Semitrailer
(Type WB-50) which is 8.5 feet wide and 55 feet long. Forty percent of all equipment deliveries,
excavation debris, and material hauling trips are anticipated to take place in the nighttime or
daytime off-peak hours. The night time trip generation represents the maximum number of trips
that can reasonably be expected to deliver equipment to the site on one or more nights. These
trips will vary, depending on the ability of equipment providers and shippers to deliver goods in
the daytime, and also the ability to offload equipment in a timely manner. No more than 80 total
night time trips are expected to occur during the 12 or 18 month construction period. All of the
employee food delivery trips will take place during the daytime off-peak period.

Aggregate material hauling trips will travel between the project site and an off-site quarry site.
Approximately 10 daily trips to and from the quarry site will occur during the off-peak hours and
will not have a significant impact on traffic operations.

Approximately 20 truckloads throughout the duration of the Project Construction Phase will be
considered oversized loads. These trips will be required to obtain permits in accordance with
Caltrans and applicable governing agencies.

18 Month Construction Schedule Trip Generation

As previously stated, a construction schedule longer than 12 months will result in lower daily
construction trip generation. The Project Construction Phase trip generation for an 18-month
construction schedule is displayed in Table 6b. The 18-month construction schedule will result
in 196 daily trips and 64 trips during the AM and PM peak hours or 67 fewer daily trips and 24
fewer AM and PM peak hour trips than would occur during the 12-month construction schedule.
The potential impacts will thus be less with reduced traffic with an 18-month construction period.

Notes:
*Based upon peak construction phase of a 280 Megawatt Facility over an 18-month construction period.
*Project Construction Phase trip generation is based upon a total workforce of 541 employees.
* Personal Vehicles are FHWA Class 1 - 3 vehicles. Heavy vehicles are FHWA Class 4 and above vehicles.
*Estimated number of shuttle bus trips is based upon 95% of employees transported to the site via shuttle with a single bus capacity
of 46 passengers. Construction employees will be required to utilize the shuttle program as a condition of their employment.




Project Operation Phase Trip Generation:

The proposed project is anticipated to have approximately 8 to 10 permanent employees during
Project Operations Phase which will take place after Project Construction Phase completion.
The permanent employees will gain access to/from the project site via personal vehicles during
the hours of 7 AM to 8 AM and 4 PM to 5 PM. In addition, approximately 8 trips per day are
assumed for preventative and corrective maintenance activities which will occur during the off-
peak hours. For trip generation and traffic operations analysis a worst case assumption of 10
permanent employees was assumed for the Project Operation Phase. The total daily trip
generation for the Project Operation Phase is 28 trips per day. Trip generation for the Project
Operations Phase is displayed in Table 6c.

4.2      Trip Distribution
Trip distribution estimates were developed for both Project Construction Phase and Project
Operations Phase assuming project traffic would access the project site via the Private Road off
SR 41. Construction traffic distribution estimates were based on the location of suppliers and
construction personnel. The solar panels will be shipped from southern California via Interstate
5. Other materials are expected to be delivered from the San Francisco Bay area and from
Southern California.

The use of the site access point at Turkey Flat road would be infrequent and consistent with the
number of trips generated by current ranch operations (approximately 10 trips per day).
Existing ranch related trips to the Turkey Flat access point will be transferred to the project
driveway at SR 41 due the project constructed driveway improvements. The roadway
improvements at SR 41 will provide a faster access route to the ranch compared to Turkey Flat
Road. The transfer of ranch trips to the project site will offset the potential additional project
related trips to Turkey Flat Road and will result in a zero net increase in trips on Turkey Flat
Road under both Project Construction and Operations Phase conditions.

Construction workers are anticipated to arrive and depart from neighboring populated
communities including southern Monterey County, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Fresno, and
Bakersfield and travel on I-5, US 101, SR 41, and SR 46. All shuttle traffic to the site will travel
from Paso Robles via SR 46 or SR 41 from the east.

Distribution estimates for the Project Operation Phase were developed based upon the
anticipated residence location of the workforce.

The trip distribution is presented in Table 7. Trip distribution at the project study intersections is
presented for Project Construction Phase in Exhibit 6 and for Project Operation Phase in
Exhibit 7.

4.3    Trip Assignment

The peak-hour trips generated by the proposed project were assigned to the roadway system in
accordance with the trip distribution pattern discussed above. Exhibit 8 presents the Project
Construction Phase peak hour project trip assignment and Exhibit 9 presents the Project
Operations Phase peak hour trip assignment at the three project study intersections.

4.4    Site Access

Approximately one mile east of Cholame Valley Road, the project will have access off SR 41.
This will be the primary access during construction and the operations phase of the project and
will require all delivery and construction traffic to conduct a turning movement from SR 41 to and
from the driveway along the private road to the site. To accommodate vehicle turns from SR 41
the applicant will construct Caltrans standard driveway improvements including one northbound
left and one southbound right turn lane including deceleration/ acceleration lanes, vehicle
storage space, and lane taper striping. To accommodate nighttime deliveries the project will
also install lighting at the intersection of the SR 41 and the Private Access Road.

The Existing Plus Project Construction and Operations Phase intersection geometry based
upon these access improvements is presented in Exhibit 10. A conceptual layout of the
proposed driveway access and turn lanes improvements at the project driveway is shown in
Exhibit 11.

4.5    On-Site Circulation

Access roads to the project site will consist of private roads from the public roadway system as
described above. Additional private roads will be located amongst the panels to provide for
construction, maintenance and fire protection.

The existing private access road at SR 41 is currently gated. The gate will be relocated further
into the ranch to increase queuing distance for inbound traffic. It is recommended that storage
be provided for four WB-50 vehicles or a minimum of 200 feet from the ROW line. The road
traverses through several other gates and cattle guards to the project site. These gates and
guards are all 10 feet or wider. For delivery loads that cannot navigate the 10-foot wide gates,
the fence and gate posts that obstruct the load will be removed and replaced.

A portion of the road, which is currently being used to transfer cattle, is approximately 20 feet
wide with an all-weather surface and narrowest travel width of between 15 feet and 19 feet at
six creek crossings. Shoulder width is between 2 feet and 4 feet on each side of the road.

North of the corral, the road is currently between 20 and 30 feet wide and will be graveled to
provide an all-weather surface. The current roadway width can accommodate truck traffic. All
gates and cattle guards are 10 feet or wider and can allow truck access. For delivery loads that
cannot navigate the 10-foot wide gates, the fence and gate posts that obstruct the load will be
removed and replaced.

Current and future access to the site from Cholame Valley Road is along Turkey Flat Road.
Turkey Flat road is a paved public road from Cholame Valley Road until it reaches the gate at
the ranch. The gate access is just west of the project site. Turkey Flat Road then continues as
an all-weather gravel road from the gate through the project site. The roadway travel width is
generally 20 feet. The narrower widths are located at creek crossings only and vary between 11
feet and 16 feet. The roadway has sufficient width to accommodate truck and fire truck
movements. The ranch uses this access road for cattle farming activities.

On-site dirt roads in-between the panels will be 20 feet wide. These roads will be used for
construction and maintenance.

4.6    Existing Plus Project Construction Phase Traffic Operations

The Project Construction Phase trips were added to the Existing Conditions Weekday and
Friday traffic volumes to obtain Existing Plus Project Construction Phase traffic volumes. The
percentage of heavy vehicles was adjusted per the project trip generation in the Synchro model
to account for operations impacts due to heavy vehicles at intersections and a PCE factor was
applied to ADT traffic volumes for roadway segment operations analysis. Exhibit 14 presents
Existing Plus Project Construction Phase traffic volumes during the weekday (Monday –
Thursday) peak hour. Exhibit 15 presents Existing Plus Project Construction Phase traffic
volumes with Friday peak hour traffic volumes.

4.7    Existing Plus Project Construction Phase Roadway Segment LOS Analysis

The project study area roadway segments were analyzed under the existing roadway capacity
configuration using the ADT-based LOS thresholds presented in Table 2. A passenger car
equivalence factor (PCE) was applied to convert heavy vehicle trips into an “equivalent number
of passenger cars” for LOS calculation. The PCE factor was applied to account for the reduced
performance characteristics (stopping, starting, maneuvering, etc.) of heavy vehicles in the
traffic flow. Based on a review of prior studies in the vicinity, a PCE of 3.0 was applied to all
project construction phase generated heavy vehicle trips. This assumption is conservative and
is generally accepted practice approved by reviewing agencies. The results of the Existing Plus
Project Construction Phase roadway segment LOS analysis are presented in Table 8 below.

As shown, the roadway segment of SR 46 between SR 41 and Branch Road will operate at an
unacceptable LOS E under Existing Plus Project Construction Phase conditions. The project
will add a passenger car equivalent of 218 daily trips during Project Construction Phase to this
section of SR 46. Since the roadway segment currently operates at an unacceptable LOS, any
addition of traffic by the project is considered a significant impact according to the Caltrans
significance criteria.

4.8    Existing Plus Project Roadway Segment Mitigations

Caltrans is currently widening SR 46 from two lanes to four lanes from West Centre Street to the
four lane expressway section at Branch Road. Some portions of the widening project have
been constructed or are currently being constructed. In addition, the Segments from West
Center Drive through SR 41, and the segment immediately east of SR 41, are anticipated to be
under construction by 2018, per Caltrans staff (email from John Luchetta, dated
11/29/2012).This is expected to be beyond the time frame for project construction. The
construction of the improvements to SR 46 will improve roadway segment LOS between West
Centre Street and Branch Road from an unacceptable LOS E to an acceptable LOS A for
Existing and Existing Plus Project conditions and the project would no longer have a significant
impact on this roadway segment.

4.9      Existing Plus Project Construction Phase Intersection LOS Analysis

Table 9 summarizes Existing Plus Project Construction Phase intersection LOS with weekday
conditions. Table 10 summarizes Existing Plus Project Construction Phase intersection LOS
under Friday conditions. The percentage of heavy vehicles factor was adjusted in the Synchro
model at each movement per the Project Construction Phase trip generation. The results were
measured against the Caltrans standards and indicate that the addition of Project Construction
Phase trips would result in a significant impact to the intersection of SR 41 / SR 46 during the
Friday PM peak hour. All other intersections operate at an acceptable LOS during Weekday
and Friday AM and PM peak hours.

The intersection of SR 41 / 46 operates at an acceptable overall LOS A during all peak hours;
however the southbound left movement operates at an unacceptable LOS F during Friday PM
peak hour conditions. The project will add 30 trips to the southbound left movement during the
Friday PM peak hour. Because the southbound left movement currently operates at an

5. Project Operation Phase Plus Cumulative
Conditions
The proposed Project will consist of 10 permanent employees during the Project Operations
Phase. The permanent employees will gain access to/from the project site via personal
vehicles. The permanent employees are not projected to have significant LOS and/or delay
impacts to the adjacent roadway. Therefore, Project Operation Phase conditions are projected
to be similar to Existing conditions with project impacts less critical than under Project
Construction Phase conditions. Thus, a quantitative Project Operations Phase conditions
analysis is not warranted.

The Project will add 28 daily trips (10 in the AM peak hour and 10 in the PM peak hour) to the
roadway network. The addition of the Project Operation Phase traffic will be insignificant.

In addition, Caltrans will eliminate the existing at-grade intersection at the SR 41 / SR 46
junction and construct an interchange for grade separated connection between SR 41 and SR
46. This Project is anticipated to be under construction by 2018 and Project traffic will not
impact the proposed future improvements to the interchange. The existing and future widening
of SR 46, as indicated in Exhibit 16, will improve traffic operations to acceptable for cumulative
conditions.

When the Wye is constructed, the Project driveway/access off SR 41 will be realigned to
continue to provide access to the Ranch and the Project. Exhibit 17 indicates the planned
realignment of the Project access road as provided by Caltrans District 5. The access road will
have a full at-grade intersection with SR 41.

Traffic related to the Project Operations Phase would be added to the intersection of SR 41 / SR
46 which is anticipated to operate at an unacceptable LOS on the southbound left turn
movement. During the Friday PM peak hour, the southbound left turn movement at the
intersection of SR 41 / 46 currently operates at LOS F, and is anticipated to continue to operate
at a LOS F under Operations Phase conditions. Therefore, the addition of Project operations
traffic to the southbound left turn movement would result in a potentially significant impact.
Caltrans plans to construct a grade separated interchange at the intersection of SR 41 / 46 with
the future widening project. This improvement is anticipated to occur after 2018, after which
time the impact will be eliminated.

SR 46 between SR 41 and Branch Road currently operates at an unacceptable LOS E during
the day. The Project is anticipated to add 20 trips per day during the Project Operations Phase.
The SR 46 segments will continue to operate at an unacceptable LOS. This is considered a
potentially significant short term impact. Caltrans plans to widen SR 46 between SR 41 and
Branch Road to four lanes. This improvement is anticipated to occur after 2018, after which
time the impact will be eliminated.

The Project Applicant does not have the authority or control to implement the improvement and
thus for purposes of this analysis, the impact would remain significant and unavoidable until
such time as the improvement is implemented by Caltrans.

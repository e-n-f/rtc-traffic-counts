1.0       Executive Summary

The applicant proposes to develop a retail center in the northeast quadrant and northwest
quadrant of the intersection of Saxon Boulevard and Sterling Silver Boulevard in City of Deltona,
Volusia County, Florida. The Retail Center will consist of the following developments:


Northeast Corner of Saxon Boulevard and Sterling Silver Boulevard
      ·   44,000 square foot (sf) Supermarket; and
      ·   5,700 square foot (sf) Convenience Market with Gasoline Pumps.


Northwest Corner of Saxon Boulevard and Sterling Silver Boulevard
      ·   14,000 square foot (sf) Shopping Center;
      ·   4,500 square foot (sf) Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Through Window; and
      ·   4,500 square foot (sf) Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Through Window.


The two sites are currently vacant. The project is anticipated to be complete and operational in
the year 2016. Access from the site to the roadway network is proposed through: two (2) right-
in/right-out driveways on Saxon Boulevard, one (1) full access driveway on Sterling Silver
Boulevard, one (1) right-in/right-out/left-in driveway on Sterling Silver Boulevard, two (2) full
access driveways on Alabaster Way, and one (1) right-in driveway on Alabaster Way.


The study area roadways are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service with the
exception of the following roadway segments:
      ·   Saxon Boulevard from I-4 to Finland Drive; and
      ·   Saxon Boulevard from Finland Drive to Normandy Boulevard.


These two roadway segments are classified as critical roadways and are deficient in existing
conditions. The proposed project impact on these two roadways is 3.7%, which is not a significant
impact.


The study area signalized intersections are expected to operate at acceptable LOS with the
exception of the following for future conditions:
      ·   Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive in AM peak hour; and
      ·   Saxon Boulevard & Normandy Boulevard in AM peak hour.




CPH, Inc.                                           1                                November 2013
W9401.1­Saxon Sterling Silver BPUD, Deltona, FL                  Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA)



The intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive is currently operating at a 120 seconds
cycle length during the AM peak hour. By modifying the cycle length to 125 seconds this
intersection is expected to operate at acceptable levels of service.


The intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Normandy Boulevard is operating at LOS F in existing and
future background conditions. In future total conditions, with the addition of project traffic this
intersection continues to operate at LOS F. However, the intersection delay is anticipated to
increase by only 4.6 seconds, which is less than 5% of the future background conditions
intersection delay.


The study area unsignalized intersections are expected to operate at acceptable LOS with the
exception of Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard.


The following improvements are recommended as a result of this analysis:
    ·   for the intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive, modify am peak hour cycle
        length from 120 seconds to 125 seconds;
    ·   for the intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard, add second
        southbound left-turn lane at Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard and provide
        signalization;
    ·   a 185' Westbound right-turn lane at Saxon Boulevard & Driveway 1;
    ·   a 185' Westbound right-turn lane at Saxon Boulevard & Driveway 2;
    ·   a 170' Northbound left-turn lane at Sterling Silver Boulevard & Alabaster Way; and
    ·   a 145' Northbound right-turn lane at Sterling Silver Boulevard & Alabaster Way.

3.0     Trip Generation

The trip generation potential for the proposed project was determined based upon the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Internal capture and pass-by
rates were applied based upon ITE Trip Generation Handbook. Pass-by trips were checked to be
less than 14% of the adjacent street peak hour traffic. Tables 3-1 and 3-2, shows a summary of
ITE Trip Generation. Please see Appendix B for trip generation worksheets.

AM peak hour (7am to 9am) and PM peak hour (4pm to 6pm) turning movement count data were
collected at the study area intersections. Raw turning movement count data for the study area
intersections are attached in the Appendix C. Appropriate Peak Season Correction Factor (PSCF)
was applied to the raw turning movement counts based upon PSCF factors published by FDOT
for Volusia County. Please see the attached PSCF sheet in Appendix C.


In addition, 24 hour road tube counts were collected on Saxon Boulevard, east and west of
Sterling Silver Boulevard and on Sterling Silver Boulevard, north of Saxon Boulevard. The 24
hour tube counts were collected for the signal warrant analysis at the intersection of Saxon
Boulevard and Sterling Silver Boulevard. Please see the attached raw tube counts in Appendix H.

5.0       Analysis Scenarios

Existing Traffic Conditions
The year 2013 is considered the base year traffic conditions or existing conditions. Based upon
discussions with staff, existing condition vehicle turning movements were collected. Appropriate
peak season correction factors were applied to the raw turning movement counts to account for
the seasonal variations in the traffic. The analysis for the existing conditions was performed for
AM peak hour and PM peak hour. Please see traffic volume figures in Appendix D for reference.
A copy of the peak season correction factor that was used in this analysis is attached in Appendix
C.


Future Background Traffic Conditions
The proposed project is anticipated to be completed for construction and operational in the year
2016. Future background traffic conditions, also referred to as future non-project traffic conditions,
are those present in the study area in the year 2016, prior to the construction and operation of the
proposed project. Future background volumes were determined based upon a growth rate of
2.5% per year. Future background traffic volumes were calculated by applying a 2.5%
background growth per year to the existing AM peak hour and PM peak hour, peak season traffic
volumes. Please see traffic volume figures in Appendix D for reference.


Future Total Traffic Conditions
The AM peak hour and PM peak hour future total traffic volumes were calculated by adding the
future background traffic volumes and project traffic volumes. Please see traffic volume figures in
Appendix D for reference.

5.1       Scheduled/Planned/Funded/Improvements

Based upon review of FDOT five-year work program and Volusia County Capital Improvement
Element (CIE), the following improvements were identified. Please see Appendix G for pages

The intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive is currently operating at a 120 seconds
cycle length during the AM peak hour. By modifying the cycle length to 125 seconds this
intersection is expected to operate at acceptable levels of service.


The intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Normandy Boulevard is operating at LOS F in existing and
future background conditions. In future total conditions, with the addition of project traffic this
intersection continues to operate at LOS F. However, the intersection delay is anticipated to
increase by only 4.6 seconds, which is less than 5% of the future background conditions
intersection delay.

6.0       Traffic Signal Warrant Analyses

6.1       Field Observations and Data Collection

      ·   24-hour tube counts were collected at Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard on
          September 11, 2013 (traffic counts attached in Appendix H);
      ·   the posted speed on the Saxon Boulevard (major street) is 40 miles per hour (mph) ;
      ·   the lane geometry on each of the major approaches is 2 lanes or more (2 lanes) ;
      ·   the posted speed limit on Sterling Silver Boulevard (minor street) is 25 mph; and
      ·   the lane geometry on the highest minor street (south leg) approach is 1 lane.



6.2       Signal Warrant Analysis


24 hour machine (tube) counts were collected at the location of the proposed signalized
intersection of Saxon Boulevard (major street) and Sterling Silver Boulevard (minor street). The
data was collected on September 11, 2013 for a 24 hour period in one-hour intervals. The data
collected was then processed and a determination was made to identify the eight highest hourly
volumes at the proposed intersections. In addition, the projected traffic data from Sterling Silver
Boulevard were split into hourly volumes using daily Shopping Center (ITE Land Use Code: 820)
traffic distribution (See Appendix H) data to determine the approach volumes from Sterling Silver
Boulevard to be used as minor street approach input.


The eight highest hourly volumes from minor street approaches, Sterling Silver Boulevard were
determined, and used as input for the analysis, along with the traffic counts for the same eight
highest hours on the major street approaches (processed tube counts). The traffic projected from
the proposed retail center was added to the minor street volumes.


The total approach volumes of the minor streets were considered as input for signal warrant
analysis given the magnitude of left and right turn traffic volumes. The eight highest hours
determined were between 7:00 am to 8:00 am and 12:00 pm to 7:00 pm. The raw machine
counts (tube counts) are included in Appendix H. Per the MUTCD criteria for traffic signal warrant
analysis the minor street approach volumes may be considered to be sum of traffic on the
approach (left, thru and right) or a combination of select movements based on engineering
judgment.


The traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted for the intersection of Saxon Boulevard &
Sterling Silver Boulevard based upon the procedures in MUTCD. Table 6-1, below shows a
summary of the results.

6.3        Crash Analysis

The crash analysis consists of analyzing the traffic collision history within three hundred feet of
the intersection for the crash data obtained from 2009 to 2011 (approximately three years). Crash
history for the intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard was obtained from
Volusia County Traffic Engineering Department. The overall crash analysis for this intersection
indicated that there were a total 7 crashes occurred during the three year period. None of these 7
crashes are signal correctible.

6.4        Results

Based upon the results of traffic signal warrant analysis, for the intersection of Saxon Boulevard &
Sterling Silver Boulevard:


      ·    Warrant 1 was not met for 100% criteria; and
      ·    Warrant 2 was not met for 100% criteria.


The warrant criteria for warrant 1 were not met for one hour. For the remaining seven hours the
criteria was met. The minor street volumes were significantly more than the MUTCD threshold.
Similarly, the warrant criteria for warrant 2 were not met for one hour. For the remaining three
hours the criteria was met. The minor street volumes were significantly more than the MUTCD
threshold. Therefore, a traffic signal is recommended for installation at this intersection.

9.0       Conclusions

The applicant proposes to develop a retail center in the northeast quadrant and northwest
quadrant of the intersection of Saxon Boulevard and Sterling Silver Boulevard in City of Deltona,
Volusia County, Florida. The Retail Center will consist of the following developments:


Northeast Corner of Saxon Boulevard and Sterling Silver Boulevard
      ·   44,000 square foot (sf) Supermarket; and
      ·   5,700 square foot (sf) Convenience Market with Gasoline Pumps.


Northwest Corner of Saxon Boulevard and Sterling Silver Boulevard
      ·   14,000 square foot (sf) Shopping Center;
      ·   4,500 square foot (sf) Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Through Window; and
      ·   4,500 square foot (sf) Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Through Window.


The two sites are currently vacant. The project is anticipated to be complete and operational in
the year 2016. Access from the site to the roadway network is proposed through:
      ·   two (2) right-in/right-out driveways on Saxon Boulevard;
      ·   one (1) full access driveway on Sterling Silver Boulevard;
      ·   one (1) right-in/right-out/left-in driveway on Sterling Silver Boulevard;
      ·   two (2) full access driveways on Alabaster Way; and
      ·   one (1) right-in driveway on Alabaster Way.


The study area roadways are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service with the
exception of the following roadway segments:
      ·   Saxon Boulevard from I-4 to Finland Drive; and
      ·   Saxon Boulevard from Finland Drive to Normandy Boulevard.


These two roadway segments are classified as critical roadways and are deficient in existing
conditions. The proposed project impact on these two roadways is 3.7%, which is not a significant
impact.


The study area signalized intersections are expected to operate at acceptable LOS with the
exception of the following:
      ·   Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive in AM peak hour; and
      ·   Saxon Boulevard & Normandy Boulevard in AM peak hour.

The intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive is currently operating at a 120 seconds
cycle length during the AM peak hour. By modifying the cycle length to 125 seconds this
intersection is expected to operate at acceptable levels of service.


The intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Normandy Boulevard is operating at LOS F in existing and
future background conditions. In future total conditions, with the addition of project traffic this
intersection continues to operate at LOS F. However, the intersection delay is anticipated to
increase by only 4.6 seconds, which is less than 5% of the future background conditions
intersection delay.


The study area unsignalized intersections are expected to operate at acceptable LOS with the
exception of Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard.


The following improvements are recommended as a result of the above analysis:
    ·   for the intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive, modify am peak hour cycle
        length from 120 seconds to 125 seconds;
    ·   for the intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard, add second
        southbound left-turn lane at Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard and provide
        signalization;
    ·   a 185' Westbound right-turn lane at Saxon Boulevard & Driveway 1;
    ·   a 185' Westbound right-turn lane at Saxon Boulevard & Driveway 2;
    ·   a 170' Northbound left-turn lane at Sterling Silver Boulevard & Alabaster Way; and
    ·   a 145' Northbound right-turn lane at Sterling Silver Boulevard & Alabaster Way.

           Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Methodology Letter- 2nd Revision


Dear Mr. Bowley:

Provided here for your review and comment is a Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) methodology for
the above referenced project. The methodology has been prepared to be consistent with the City of
Deltona and Volusia County Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) guidelines and our discussions with you
regarding this project.

Introduction
The following methodology outlines the procedures and data that will be used to evaluate the projected
transportation impacts of a proposed retail center located in the northeast and northwest quadrants of the
intersection of Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard in the City of Deltona, Florida. The following
methodology describes the procedures and assumptions that will be used to prepare a transportation
impact analysis. Please see the attached site location map for reference. The proposed site consists of
the following uses:

Northeast Corner of Saxon Boulevard Sterling Silver Boulevard
   · 44,000 sf Supermarket
   · 5,700 sf Convenience Market with Gasoline Pumps

Northwest Corner of Saxon Boulevard Sterling Silver Boulevard
   · 14,000 sf Shopping Center
   · Two (2) 4,500 sf Fast Food Restaurants with Drive-Through Windows

Site Access
Access to the site is proposed through the following driveways:

    ·   two (2) right-in/right-out driveways on Saxon Boulevard;
    ·   a full-access driveway on Sterling Silver Boulevard;
    ·   a right-in/right-out/left-in driveway on Sterling Silver Boulevard;
    ·   two (2) full access driveway on Alabaster Way; and
    ·   a right-in driveway on Alabaster Way.

The build-out year for the proposed project is 2016.




 
 
 
Trip Generation
The trip generation potential for the proposed project will be determined based upon the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition. Internal capture and pass-by rates will be
applied based upon ITE Trip Generation Handbook. Pass-by trips will be checked to be less than 14% of
the adjacent street peak hour traffic.

Based upon preliminary trip generation projection, it is anticipated that the proposed project will generate
15,676 daily trips, 365 net-new am peak hour trips, and 524 net-new pm peak hour trips. Please see the
attached trip generation worksheets for reference.

Project Trip Distribution
Trip distribution for the proposed project will be determined based upon Florida Standard Urban
Transportation Model Structure (FSUTMS) using Central Florida Regional Planning Model (CFRPM).
Model files will be obtained from Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Please see the attached
trip distribution plot and trip distribution figure for reference.

Study Area
Based upon Volusia County TIA guidelines for significance test, the study area includes the following
intersections and roadway segments. Please see the attached significance test.

Intersections
    · Saxon Boulevard & Finland Drive;
    · Saxon Boulevard & Sterling Silver Boulevard;
    · Saxon Boulevard & Normandy Boulevard;
    · Saxon Boulevard & Tivoli Drive
    · Providence Boulevard & Tivoli Drive; and
    · All project entrances.

Roadway Segments
   · Saxon Boulevard from Enterprise Road to Veterans Memorial Parkway;
   · Saxon Boulevard from Veterans Memorial Parkway to FDOT Park & Ride;
   · Saxon Boulevard from FDOT Park & Ride to I-4;
   · Saxon Boulevard from I-4 to Finland Drive;
   · Saxon Boulevard from Finland Drive to Normandy Boulevard;
   · Saxon Boulevard from Normandy Boulevard to Sterling Silver Boulevard;
   · Saxon Boulevard from Sterling Silver Boulevard to Tivoli Drive;
   · Saxon Boulevard from Tivoli Drive to Providence Boulevard;
   · Saxon Boulevard from Providence Boulevard to Normandy Boulevard;
   · Tivoli Drive from Saxon Boulevard to Providence Boulevard; and
   · Normandy Boulevard from Saxon Boulevard to Deltona Boulevard.

The critical/near-critical roadway segments per County's five-mile radius map within the study area will be
included in the future conditions analysis. Please see the attached five-mile radius map for reference.

Analysis Scenarios
The future analysis year will be 2016, given the anticipated date for completion of construction of the
proposed project. Analysis will be conducted for the existing, future background and future total traffic
conditions.

Background (Vested) Traffic
Background traffic volumes will be calculated based upon historical traffic data available on Saxon
Boulevard from I-4 to Tivoli Drive. Background growth rate calculations yielded a growth rate of les than
1%. Per coordination with the City staff, a growth rate of 2.5% per year will be used for analysis purposes.
Please see the attached traffic trends sheets for reference.




 
 
 
Traffic Count Data
AM peak hour (7am to 9am) and PM peak hour (4pm to 6pm) manual traffic counts will be conducted at
study area intersections. Traffic volumes (counts) will be adjusted to peak-season conditions using
Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) peak season correction factors (PSCF) for Volusia County.
Traffic data will be collected during the school season.

Scheduled/Planned/Funded Improvements
Planned/scheduled/funded roadway improvements information available from FDOT/Volusia County/City
of Deltona will be included in the analysis.

Traffic Analysis
Intersection capacity analysis for the study area intersections will be conducted using Highway Capacity
Software (HCS) or Synchro software for existing, future background, and future total traffic conditions for
AM and PM peak hour conditions. Traffic signal timing data for study area signalized intersections will be
obtained from Volusia County Traffic Engineering.

Roadway segment capacity analysis will be conducted for study area roadways at a generalized level
using traffic data available from Volusia County 2011 Average Annual Daily Traffic & Historical Counts
and FDOT LOS tables. For roadways found to be deficient detailed arterial analysis will be conducted
using ARTPLAN or HCS or Synchro software. All electronic files of all intersection and arterial analysis
will be included in the TIA.

In addition a traffic signal warrant analysis will be conducted at the intersection of Sterling Silver
Boulevard based upon projected traffic volumes.

Turn Lane Analysis
A review of the turn lane requirements at project driveways, and design as applicable, will be performed
based upon the requirements published in Volusia County Land Development Code.

Report
A signed and sealed report which details the procedures, data, and results of the traffic analysis outlined
above will be provided to the City and County staff for review and comment. Two (2) hard copies of the
TIA with revised methodology and electronic file (in pdf format) will be provided.

Please feel free to contact me at (813) 288-0233 if you have any questions or comments regarding this
proposed methodology or require additional information.

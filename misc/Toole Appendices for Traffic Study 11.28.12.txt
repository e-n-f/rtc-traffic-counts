895866     The biggest safety issues for are family follow: Safe walking route - there are no crossing guards or safe traffic lites,
           state commuter highway (Glebe Rd) where traffic averages about 35-50 mph with no enforcement, lack of safe
           sidewalks in winter, ice and snow, darkness in the morning for middle-schoolers, lack of police visibility, instances of
           predators approaching children and youth.

895871     The distance from school to our house is easy for a middle schooler to handle, and he is old enough to cross Old
           Dominion safely. There are many other kids walking back to our neighborhood as well. He doesn't walk in the
           morning because of the early start time, and we carpool with another family.

895878     We are alarmed at reports from the past few years of men harassing or groping girls walking to/from the middle and
           high school. We still let our daughter (and son) walk, but they are strictly required to use the buddy system and never
           walk alone. Traffic goes way too fast on 26th street, but towards the East, there is a sidewalk. They want to meet up
           with a friend to the West, but I won't allow that because 26th at Lexington is a blind hill with no sidewalk. It's
           dangerous at that point.

895887     WMS is our home school, but our 6th grader is currently enrolled in private school. I responded as if we were
           attending Williamsburg and we would be walkers.

895891     I would not let my daughter walk alone to/from school. If she had a group of kids to walk with, I would be okay with it
           when it was not bad weather. (Perhaps a "walking club"?)

895915     I drive my 6th to WMS enroute to taking my 7th to his private school and have noticed the last two weeks that the
           morning traffic at least at 7:30 is very reasonable.

896005     Walking is healthy for children. It gives them a little workout in the morning to get their bodies and minds working
           before school starts. It's also a great way for children to be responsible for themselves. Children are too dependent on
           parents taking them places and getting them where they should be on time. I believe that if the responsiblity is put on
           the child, we as parents, are preparing them for college and/or work. Children can form walking groups if parents don't
           want their child walking by themselves. I would also like schools to teach students what to do if they come across
           certain situations. This would reinforce what parents are already telling their child.

896043     My children and I have walked from our house to school and it took us approximately 50 minutes, door-to-door, one
           way and in good weather. I just don't see my 11 year old daughter, carrying her backpack and musical instrument,
           walk to school and back on a daily basis.

896094     between our house and teh school not only are there intersections which are really ocmplicated, but there is a VERY
           steep hill between us and williamsburg, before we attended Tuckahoe an dthe kids walked or took their scooter to
           school.but they also enjoy the busride and are active enough that that time with their peers is not osmething I want to
           interrupt

896145     Biking is wonderful .Thee need to be MORE cross guards and for LONGER periods of time.

896193     The intersection at Williamsburg Blvd and Ohio Street has been a problem for years. The drivers headed East on
           Williamsburg are almost always traveling above the speed limit and even when they aren't they often do not stop for
           people crossing the road even WITH a crossing guard. I believe it's a combination of being a rush hour route so
           people are in a hurry combined with the fact that they have increased speed coming down hill and cannot see people
           in the crosswalk. Many times, even when the first car stops, the ones behind will try to pass it because they don't
           realize someone is walking across the street. It makes it almost impossible for my child to walk to school on her own
           because there is no crossing guard there at the time she needs to go to school at 8 a.m. In addition to being a safety
           patrol, she's involved with before school programs such as Knights at Nine and Choir. As a working parent it's difficult
           to allow her to be in after school programs because she cannot cross the street without being in danger because the
           crossing guard is not there past 4:10 p.m. As an adult, who is taller and cautious of traffic, I've still nearly been run
           down by cars. It doesn't matter if I'm crossing alone or with a group of children, parents, dogs, etc. The intersection
           needs a light or stop sign. If the intersection at Harrison and Williamsburg (a crossing for middle school) can have a
           light, I don't see why the county doesn't see the importance of this intersection having one. Any of the crossing guards
           who have worked that intersection can testify to the dangers of it. Even with reflecting clothes, a whistle and a stop
           sign in their hand, they are not safe and cannot keep the children safe because the cars simply do not always stop.

896202     Children in middle school should be encouraged to walk to school. While my child does, the intersection at
           Williamsburg and Ohio is not safe to cross at any age. The speed and lack of right of way to pedestrians is disturbing
           and needlessly puts people in harm's way. I highly encourage the school board to insist on a light at that intersection.

896256     I would love my child to walk to and from school alone starting in 6th grade. However, we receive repeated warnings
           from the school to NOT allow children to walk home alone. It is not always feasible to find a friend to walk with, so
           then she calls for a parent to walk with her or drive her.



                                                                                                                       Page 13 of 20
896295   The bus situation this year is very trying. My child is on a bus that sits 3 to a seat. For middle school age children, I
         find this unsafe and uncomfortable. The safety has to be remedied quickly as you will have many parents in an uproar.

896639   The intersection between Williamsburg Blvd. and George Mason urgently needs a traffic light or at least a conversion
         to a 4-way stop sign. It is very dangerous to cross and a new elementary school at WMS site would make traffic even
         heavier in this area.

896762   I would allow my daughter to walk/ride a bike to school with other children but because of the fact that kids are
         approached by weird men on a regular basis in the Williamsburg / Yorktown / Nottingham area, I cannot with good
         conscience do it.

897084   Make street crossings and roads safer for children to walk to school. The addition of wide sidewalks and bike lanes
         along Old Dominion would help.

897104   Our daughter takes the school bus to and from school approximately 3 days a week; we drive her to school about 2
         days a week and pick her up from school about once a week; she walks home or to somewhere else after school
         approximately one day a week. A key factor in our decision not to allow her to walk or ride her bike to school is how
         early school starts (7:50am). For a large portion of the school year, it is dark when she has to leave the house, and
         we do not think it is safe for a young girl to walk alone in the dark, even in North Arlington. The earliness of school is
         also the primary reason we drive her a couple mornings a week as opposed to having her take the bus. Last year she
         had to leave the house at 7:15am to catch the bus at 7:18. This year she has to leave at 6:45am because the bus
         stop has been moved farther away and the bus time is now 6:59am. It is difficult for us to get her out of the house
         every day by 6:45am. If we drive, we can leave the house 50 minutes later at 7:35am.

895869   The biggest challenge for getting my child to walk to school is the early start time of middle school. If school started
         later I think he would walk. Most days I drive him to school and he walks home. I don't think riding a bike to school is
         safe because of the volume of traffic, especially right around the school.

895876   The biggest concern I have is the corner of Harrison & 26th St n. It is a very busy with cars and people. It needs to
         have a 4-way stop sign. Since I have lived in my current residence, I have personally been almost hit 3 or 4 times,
         including once while pushing a stroller. I have seen many near misses with cars vs adults and students. Addtionally,
         in cases of severe (snow storm/lighting storms, etc) weather I would like to see a bus go from WMS down George
         Mason or allow children to stay in the librarry until they are picked up or the weather threat has passed.

895885   I think 1 mile is too long for my children to walk to and from school.

895901   My children in high school and middle school are reluctant to ride their bikes besuae there is not enough bike parking
         and bikes have been stolen from the school

895916   It would be nice to have crossing guards at all major intersections along the route home. Also it would be nice for the
         Williamsburg staff to know who the child walks with on a regular basis-just in case of an emergency.....NO child
         should be allowed to walk a far distance home by themselves.

895927   The route is rather hilly - so it would not be fun, but hard work. It is also a good idea to exercise - so I think the
         exercise should be strongly encouraged.

895931   Given that he's over 2.5 miles I don't see ever allowing him to walk or bike to school, plus there is no good way to get
         there that doesn't go along very busy roads. In addition, he carries an instrument and I don't see how he could do
         that on a bike. We have some of these same issues in getting to our bus stop, which is 1/2 mile away and he is being
         driven (!) to the bus stop in the morning, so if some of these issues could be resolved there that would also be of
         some help. I do think that a 1 1/2 mile distance to walk/bike to school is unrealistic and I can see some kids in our
         neighborhood (now going to HS w/o a bus) choosing instead to be truant rather than deal with the weather (they are
         from a less afluent area with less parental support and less access to proper attire to walk in the snow and rain).

895937   Arlington should invest in improving walk & bike infrastructure, rather than more school buses.

895964   i did not allow my child to bike to school until the second half of 6th grade.

895968   Your survery does not capture all of the reasons why a child might not want to walk to school. My son does not have
         any friends near my home that he can walk with, does not like to walk alone, and likes to get home quickly after
         school. Also, I drive him in the morning because he has a hard time waking up even when I shorten his morning by
         driving him to school. He has always been this way, no matter how much sleep he gets. However, useful to note that
         he spends half of his week with his father, who lives much closer to Wsbg, and he does walk to and from school from
         his dad's residence.

896018   my son reports that there could be more bike racks at school

896069   If you start the middle school day later so that there is more time in the am to get ready, that would make thinking
         about walking to school easier. I dont know how you will protect the kids from being approached by creeps. More
         crossing guards would help on the traffic safety front. I will not allow my child to come home to an empty house, so I
         will always pick up at the end of the day.

                                                                                                                         Page 14 of 20
896085   1 or 1.5 miles is not too far to walk. the problem is kids have to cross major streets with no lights or cross walks
         (Glebe Road and Old Dominion).

896178   The one factor that works most against my child biking/walking (just over a mile) is the need to carry a moderately
         large/heavy musical instrument -- in addition to the usually heavy backpack, of course -- both ways, each day
         (necessary to meet expectations for daily home practice). Biking in particular with his instrument is very tricky. Not
         sure anything can be done about it, though.

896223   Middle school starts too early for my son to walk. Soon it will be dark in the mornings. Middle school kids need the
         most sleep of any age group why do they start school the earliest?? Let the elementary schools start early then I'd be
         happy for my son to walk/ ride bike

896479   Bottom line: the policy did not take into consideration at all the complexity related to traffic density, intersections, and
         even the darkness in lenth of route. The distance element was the only consideration, and it was property line to
         property line, and missed that it adds another 3/10 of a mile to go from edge of property to school door.

896540   You don't ask about whether I'd be more comfortable if my child were walking/biking with other children. The answer
         is I would, but unfortunately there are not many children in our neighborhood who walk or bike. Perhaps with more
         encouragement, we could find companions for my son to walk/ride with and then I would feel it would be safer.

896794   While my son is at Williamsburg I would not let him walk/bike. We live too far away to walk and the automobile drivers
         on the roads he would bike on are too dangerous.

897144   I fully support my child walking the 1.1 miles to and from school, but I am concerned about his morning commute after
         Daylight Savings Time ends. I'm nervous about him walking to school on his own when it's still not light.

897540   safety should be the 1st and foremost issue when considering if my child would walk to school. Considering he would
         have to cross 3 major intersections, I am not comfortable with him walking. In addition, our house is 1.4 miles from
         school and the amount of time it would take, is not doable, particularly in the morning. Further, there have been an
         increase in crime lately, which makes me uncomfortable.

895903   My daughter sometimes has to walk from WMS to YHS for after school sport. I will not let her walk by herself - she
         must have at least one friend with her. This is because of the reports over the last few years of students being
         approached by adults in this area. She is worried about this.

895922   Our daughter walks home from school only because we have no other choice. It takes her 40 minutes to walk home
         1.5 miles. We would much rather have a bus and i worry about her walking alone on busy streets. We were told there
         would be increased police presence around the neighborhoods after school but that only lasted the 1st week or 2. We
         have also only seen one intersection with a crossing guard when there are many busy intersections the kids must
         cross. We are not happy with this situation.

896062   We live 1.2 miles from school which is too far for my daughter to walk alone safely. However, because I am a single
         parent and work, I can drive her in the AM but she must walk home in the PM. She will not be allowed to do after
         school activities because it will be too dark for her to walk home by herself in the winter late in the afternoon. PLEASE
         change the Bus policy - mostly for safety's sake, but also because of weather, traffic, darkness and distance. FYI - My
         appeal was denied.

896139   I would appreciate the county putting in the yellow signs (it's the law to stop when pedestrian's are in the crosswalk) in
         all crosswalks in school zones. I understand this is a Williamsburg Survey but Nottingham Elementary does not have
         them in all locations. Also- inforcing the speed zone limits in all school zones- with strick enforcement during school
         hours would help with near mishaps, which have happened 4 times to my family this year alone. I would be glad to
         participle in any study to show that cars do not slow down in school zones. I can be contacted at 571-338-0586 if
         needed. Also- another question on your survey may be helpful- Does your child walk alone or with friends to and from
         school. My child in 6 grade can only walk with friends (and never alone), otherwise we would drive her (inconveniently
         to school)

896194   My daughter would enjoy biking to school. Traffic issues aside, the terrain - very very hilly - would make it difficult for
         her to cycle. 2 miles is not very far, but 2 miles of steep uphills and downhills (and it is the downhills that scare her
         the most) make it highly unlikely she'd ever bike from our house to Williamsburg. And definitely not with a heavy
         backpack to carry. 2 miles is too far to walk. She simply does not have the time, unless the school decides walking to
         school and the resulting exercise is more important than her spending time doing homework.

896207   Re question 9: I would allow even small children to walk from/to school if the route was safe (cars driving slower,
         more crosswalks preferably with traffic lights to cross bigger streets).




                                                                                                                        Page 15 of 20
896231   The only reason my child walks home from school is because I was denied bus service. I work and cannot pick her
         up, so she has no choice but to walk. I do not approve of the couny's new bus policy. I would prefer her to ride the bus
         and be dropped off two blocks from our house rather than walk 1.3 miles. The only reason the school encourages
         walking is because now that we have less bus service, they have no choice but to encourage walking. I guess you
         can say walking is healthy as long as she's not hit by a car or harrassed by a pedophile. Although she participates in
         many sports and doesn't need the extra walking. The time it takes to walk home she could be spending on her
         homework before she leaves for basketball, soccer or lacrosse!

896264   Crossing Old Dominion is not safe in the morning. Worried about the number of incidents (indecent exposure etc)
         along route home

896296   Crossing guards are critical, and not just at the lighted intersections. People drive like maniacs making right hand
         turns on red and going through lights and the middle school age kids are a bit in their own world, so really need
         crossing guards to keep them alert to dangers from the cars. Also, we've had some creepy people approaching kids
         on their way home in the WMS vicinity, so that makes parents very nervous too. This is more applicable to the walk
         home from school.

896332   Traffic and pedestrian safety and enforcement in this neighborhood has been spotty at best. Williamsburg Blvd is a
         major commuter route and multiple hills provide limited visibility for those drivers who abide by the laws. Many drivers
         ignore signs and plow through zebra crossings in spite of children in the crossing. Others (even many of the parents
         who are delivering their children to schools) are busily conducting business on cell phones instead of watching for
         pedestrians. Obviously, plans for an additional elementary school on the WMS campus will create even more
         pedestrian and commuter traffic and even greater hazards for children crossing the street. If APS goes through with
         this plan, it must secure a serious commitment from ACPD for more crossing guards and more traffic enforcement,
         and to work with county transportation officials to ensure proper signage. School Zone speed limit signs should be
         made automatic to allow for proper coverage regardless of whether crossing guards are on duty. Additional zebra
         crossings should be installed and proper signage included. Pedestrian safety is already a concern in this
         neighborhood and a new elementary school will turn it into a major issue. APS needs to work with County officials to
         get this right so that children walking to school will be safe.

896342   My daughter's walk route to Williamsburg Middle School would require her to cross Glebe Rd. at the intersection of
         Glebe and Williamsburg and Old Dominion Rd. at the intersection of Old Dominion Rd. and Williamsburg. Both of
         these intersections are too dangerous for her to cross on a daily basis, particularly during rush hour in the morning
         (and during the dark in the winter mornings), and I don't see how APS could change or improve this aspect of her
         walk. It is also too far given the amount of books, etc. that she has to carry. I have let her walk home from school
         occasionally with friends, but this was usually on Fridays when her homework load was light and they used the tunnel
         under Washington Golf Country Club to cross Glebe (the tunnel runs underneath Glebe Rd). I do not foresee any
         situation in which my daughter would walk from our house 1.7 miles to WMS, across Glebe and Old Dominion. It is
         just too far and the route is not safe, given the traffic and street crossings.

896451   This survey is poorly designed. How are issues such as distance to school or time it takes to walk supposed to be
         improved? Why is there no option for improving safety by helping ensure children can walk in groups (including via
         policies such as allowing children to wait afterschool so that they can walk home with friends who have after school
         activities. Fundamentally, APS policies regarding bus transport are defective: It is unreasonable to expect a first
         grader to walk a mile EACH way to school. It is unreasonable to expect a child to walk a mile and a half EACH way to
         school, particularly when schools appear to make no effort to limit the weight of texts or materials children must carry
         to and from school. Included with afterschool and other enrichment activities, the time consumed walking cuts into
         available study/homework time.

896454   I would allow my children to walk in a group home from school, but NOT alone. I would not allow them to ride bikes
         due to safety concerns. It is not possible for them to walk to school because of time constraints.

896609   This survey is flawed because it does not include a BIG factor for children needing a car or bus ride: AMOUNT OF
         BOOKS/INSTRUMENTS/EQUIPMENT CARRIED EACH DAY. I seriously do not think my child could balance on a
         bike with the amount of heavy books and binders she has in her backpack.

896830   Williamsburg is too far from our home to walk and it would be unsafe for a minor to ride over two miles to school with
         the hills and morning traffic in Arlington

896837   Difficult to answer #11 because you can't do anything about most of these factors (distance, traffic, etc.)

897279   I think Arlington needs to improve neighborhood sidewalks and lighting; especially so in winter/darker months, when
         kids are walking in the street where there are no sidewalks they are more visible.

895861   The walk to school for my son is around 20 minutes. This is a problem in the morning - they start so early there is no
         way he would have time in the morning to walk, plus if bad weather it would not be good - therefore we drive him to
         school in the morning, which is inconvenient for us - but the best for him. At night he walks home. He is not in such a
         hurry at night obviously, and can walk, but it does worry me with the traffc etc.




                                                                                                                       Page 16 of 20
895863   My child at WMS took the morning bus to school last year, but isn't taking the morning bus this year because it would
         require him to leave the house 30 minutes earlier. So I let him sleep the additional 45-60 minutes (which is needed at
         this age) and drive him.

895870   In the winter it is too dark and cold. There are not enough crossing guards along the way. It is a far walk and it would
         be walking when rush hour is going in the morning.

895882   Kensington and Williamsburg is a very dangerous intersection for children. Cars often speed in both directions. The
         street is very wide and has no safe middle on the west side of the intersection. Cars travelling west bound, up the hill
         from Harrison, cannot be seen to children crossing the street until they crest the hill, too close to the intersection. The
         County needs to make that intersection safer.

895883   My childern always rode the bus both ways to school. Now I drive both WMS students and JES school students to
         school due to the time change of the bus and the change in the bus stop. This is totally not environmentally friendly to
         drive and there are more parents driving to school due to bus stop changes. There are 8 kids on my street alone
         who's parents take them to school individually due to the loss of our bus stop on 38th and Chesterbrook. The bus
         continues to drive right by and the bus is only half full #624. Very poor planning and over crowed bus stops with over
         25-30 kids makes the bus stop on Ditmar unsafe!!

895886   My children walked to elementary school every day when they were in elementary school. Now that they are in middle
         school (8th and 6th grades), it is too far to walk on a regular basis (35-40 minutes at a very good pace for an adult
         without a back pack). There are also some dangerous intersections to cross, which are particularly dangerous in the
         mornings. I have allowed them to walk home with a few friends when time is not an issue. The most direct route,
         Williamsburg Bvld, is dangerous for biking, especially in the morning.

895893   While I love the idea of my child walking or biking to school, I am not comfortable with them crossing Glebe,
         Williamsburg or Old Dominion. Drivers are too distracted and my child's safety is too important to me. Right now there
         are 38 children at our bus stop. I am waiting for a child to be killed because morning commuters are not careful. The
         new bus routes are a total debacle. Unsafe and poorly thought out.

895925   It's not about whether this is healthy or not....we're a family that loves sports and being outside. For us, it's the danger
         of having to cross 2 major roads to get there. Plus, the hills here are severe. Can't imagine my son, who's small,
         carrying a 15-20 pack on his back AND trying to get up the hills....in the dark, etc...

895971   The only reason I am allowing my child to walk to school is because it is safer than having him cross Old Dominion,
         unassisted, during rush hour to catch the bus!!!!!!!!! During rush hour, Old Dominion is basically a non-stop stream of
         traffic!!! I do worry about him walking to school because drivers are very aggressive and I worry about him being run
         over! If you can get the Arlington PD to monitor the traffic, I'd feel great about him walking to school.

896266   My son lives out of boundaries, which is why he gets driven to school. In the afternoon he usually walks to a friend's
         house and I pick him up around 430 to return home. Traffic at Harrison and Lee Hwy is heavy and drivers are often
         distracted (morning and afternoons) so I would NOT encourage biking to school for safety reasons. In addition, the
         backpack he is expected to carry to and from school is too heavy for bikerides. It is just not a realistic option for us-
         despite the health benefits of biking. He gets plenty of exercise in year round sports so health is not an issue here.
         Mornings are usually hectic so the idea of him rushing to school to avoid being late and/or encountering distracted
         drivers is too unsettling for me as his parent. I will continue to drive him to school for the remainder of the year.

896302   Glebe Road is the danger point for our kids. This cannot be mitigated especially with no sidewalks on part of the route.

896444   It would be good to have safety and bike care instruction at WMS. What happened to the bike club??

896458   Traffic is a very big factor in allowing my child to walk to/from school. There are many busy streets with limited
         visibility at intersections, some without sidewalks in Arlington.

896771   This survey will not provide meaningful answers. It is the combination of factors that affect walkability (distance plus
         traffic/speed plus safety of intersections). Also, the distance and time can't be changed, so question 11 doesn't make
         sense for a number of the factors specified.

897145   We do not let our child walk home in the rain, after dark, or in bad weather conditions, which means we enroll him in
         Check-In and pick him up in our car on those days. It is not realistic to expect most kids who love a mile or more from
         school to walk there in the morning, given the impact on lost sleep the extra walking time takes. Result: lots of cars
         dropping off kids in the morning.

895888   Answers to question 10 are the factors involved in my decision NOT to allow my daughter to walk/bike to elementary
         school. Now that she is in middle school, the school is much closer to our home and the walking route is relatively
         safe. More traffic in the WMS area might change that.

895889   I wouldn't say walking is "boring" or "fun" rather it is "safe" or "fearful." Child has no one else to walk with and is fearful
         of walking alone so far, especially in the dark.




                                                                                                                         Page 17 of 20
895933   The safety situation of walkers near WMS is appalling. The number of times I have seen kids almost hit is shocking.
         Driving east into the sun in the morning parents/highschoolers are blinded and kids are running across the street. In
         addition, many drivers dropping kids at many locations adds to the danger. People stop to drop off a child and other
         people swirve into the opposite lane to pass that person further endangering walkers and drivers. WMS has not
         addressed this! An additional school (with younger students) will obviously make an ignored, bad situation worse.
         What is going to take for this to be addressed. A hit child?

895934   I am more comfortable with walking than biking. For biking, I am concerned about the road traffic, especially in the
         morning when there are more cars on the road, particularly in the vicinity of the school, and people tend to be in a hurry.

895940   It is a combination of the things I checked that prevent my daughter from walking or biking to school. Just changing
         one or two won't do it. The biggest issues for me are the roads are full of busy commuters; it is time consuming to
         walk almost 2 miles and she is a busy kid; she has to wake up early enough as it is. I wouldn't want her to walk or
         ride that far in the cold, the dark, or inclement weather. She gets plenty of exercise with her sports activities.

895984   DISTANCE: Kids get 30 min more sleep in am. by driving (move start time later). ART bus passes would be $.75 X 2
         X two kids = $3.00 daily = not cost effective. Why didn't they discuss subsidized ART bus passes (i.e. 52 &53 bus)
         and coordinate route times with school start times? Distance = 1.50 mi to Williamsburg sign on Harrison st next to
         crossing guard and 1.44 mi to tree line by soccer field. Are the girls supposed to walk that way crossing Sycamore on
         own, thru the field and enter school by portables? Without driving we would have to drop after school activities due to
         no bus and crossing guards gone. Walk is negative fun due to large hill w/ books/instrument/lunch bags and neutral
         healthy due to loss of sleep in am. KEEP SPORTS FIELDS INTACT!!! They are used by most Arlington kids thru
         various sports to keep healthy. They are also some of the only well-drained fields that don't close when it rains (am
         estimating >100K was spent in each fields construction costs) Finally, Williamsburg school office staff gets poor, poor
         marks in response to parental concerns about busing/transportation issues. Personally have raised issues more that 5
         times to Williamsburg school staff and gotten the brush-off. That it's not their problem; transportation department
         handles that; that's how it has always been done; there is nothing they can do..... I don't really have confidence that
         APS can strategically fix the mess they created. This survey alone is long overdue and seems written slanted for info
         gathering and going to be used to justify a pre-determined position and not really solving parents issues.

896013   Poor questions in item 7: " How long does it normally take your child to get to school?" Is this based on walking or
         being driven? (5-10 minute drive) (20 minute walk down hill to school or 25 minute walk uphill from school) Poor
         dropdown answers for #13. The issue isn't boredom, it's fear. Re 14 (health). My daughter is a multi-sport athlete. She
         doesn't need the walk for "health." 16. We drive my daughter to/from school because walking a mile on a heavily
         trafficked road (Harrison St) makes little sense for a young girl, especially when it's dark (winter mornings) or there's
         bad weather. School policy mandating long walks is counter productive. It increases traffic and pollution (many cars
         vs. few busses). It's also a safety risk for those who don't have the resources to drive their child. Adding to WMS the
         additional traffic that comes with a new elementary school is a bad, irresponsible idea. There will be no new roads
         and athletic field space will undoubtedly be lost to buildings, parking, or both. Instead, reclaim some of the former
         schools that are now being underused as "Parks & Rec" facilities. (e.g. Madison Manner, Lee senior center, etc)

896251   Health effect is neutral: physical conditioning would improve, but chance for injury in traffic increases. My daughter
         also does not like walking because she arrives sweaty (there is a significant hill to walk up).

896262   This survey was designed very poorly. I live 3.5 miles from the school - many of these questions are irrelevant at this
         distance - yes walking is healthy, is walking a 5k to and from school every day health - no. Is it a good use of time?
         No. Can you ever correct for the distance or convenience - not unless you move our MS to my neighborhood. You
         aren't getting at the root of our problems. I for one, frequently drive my child to school rather than having her take the
         bus - because the bus arrives at school almost 25-30 minutes before it starts - those 20- minutes are better used
         sleeping later.

896456   The weight of the backpacks the kids have to carry is ridiculous. I'm not forcing my kids to walk no matter how much
         you encourage it. Not only that, they would have to leave by 7 am to get to school on time, so that means a very early
         morning and breakfast.

896486   We are too far to walk to school, especially carrying heavy backpacks, and we have a bus stop a few yards from our
         house. So walking/biking really isn't in the cards for us.

896832   The 4 children participate in numerous sports including year round swimming, dance, diving, theater, lacrosse, field
         hockey, baseball, basketball, flag football, tennis, soccer, fencing. We are busy and expect to ride the bus to school
         especially with the early start time for middle school. thanks!

895919   walking to/from is not a matter of fun or healthy for the child. For me its all about safety. I strongly disagree with kids
         having the only choice to walk to school or parents to drive. As a taxpayer, I beleive I should have the choice of letting
         my child ride a school bus, even though we live within walking distance. I feel penalized for living closer. Point is, kids
         walking on streets increases risks resulting from traffic and crime. Kids take the same route, the same days and easy
         prey for criminals. It will just take one bad event to drive the point home. Its not a risk I am happy taking and thus
         need to change my schedule as a full time working single mother to drive my son to/from school. I am very disatisfied
         with not having the option of having my son ride safely on a bus. If I lived further a bus would be provided. The choice
         should be provided for all kids.


                                                                                                                      Page 18 of 20
896243   This is our second child through Williamsburg, so we already have three years of experience with the traffic pattern. It
         is HORRIBLE trying to get through the traffic in the mornings to drop off kids! And the addition of a new elementary
         school on those grounds will exacerbate the problem. You have to do more to move traffic through the
         Harrison/Williamsburg intersection more rapidly!

896246   Please consider working parents who might be forced to drive or pickup children because of our work times. For that
         reason, we have to drive to drop-off/pick up our children.

896410   You can't send out Arlington Alerts about predators in the area and then expect parents to feel "okay" with letting their
         kids walk to/from school by themselves without providing a more visible police presence. The neighbor on the corner
         of my cul de sac stands naked in his doorway and touches himself whenever my children walk by alone. Police can't
         do anything about it because he is on his property. There are no crossing guards in the afternoon near where my son
         has to cross busy streets - in fact, the crossing guard who is at the intersection of Williamsburg and Ohio during
         ELEMENTARY SCHOOL hours was nearly hit by a vehicle while in the middle of the intersection last year. So yeah,
         my son gets a ride to school in the morning and I take time off of work to meet him and walk him home.

896831   We will never walk or bike to middle school. We expect bus service for all three years. My 4 children participate in
         numerous sports: swimming year round, fencing year round, lacrosse, tennis, basketball, flag football, soccer, dance
         classes, field hockey, diving, baseball. We participate in scouts, children's theater + others activities at church. We will
         never walk or bike to school -- especially with the early start time.

895898   My child carries a heavy instrument and also has many tight schedules for after school activites for both her and her
         siblings. In addition, we have a tight schedule of drop offs and work in the morning. I am concerned about having
         children on the streets by themselves with the reported incidents and the traffic even if these other issues were not of
         concern. Taken together, these require us to drive.

897403   Why did I say walking/biking is unhealthy? 1. Distance is 1.4 miles, uphill on the way home. Backpacks are heavy
         and bad for kids' backs. My daughter does not always wear good walking shoes. Biking with a heavy backpack is also
         dangerous, and I don't like the idea of my daughter taking her bike across major intersections like Yorktown Blvd &
         Williamsburg Blvd. Walking and biking without a backpack and for pleasure is, of course, healthy and I encourage it.
         2. I am very concerned about crime. Lots of home construction in the neighborhood and workers get off work just
         when school lets out. Will not let my daughter walk alone because I am at work and would not be able to go looking
         for her immediately if she failed to arrive home on time. She often loses her cellphone so that modicum of comfort is
         not dependable. I would prefer bus service and think 1.4 miles is WAY too far for a child to be expected to walk,
         especially considering there will be cold and rainy days. Thank you for asking -- this is LOOONG overdue.

895946   I just wanted to clarify one point on comment no. 14 - while walking in general is certainly a healthy activity, walking
         an extended distance with a heavy backpack is unhealthy and unsafe to the children. even with text books left at
         home, the weight and volume of things in backpacks makes it unhealthy for them to walk extended periods. While my
         daughter is in 8th grade, she is petite and her backpack weights almost half of what she weighs. This should be
         factored when considering encouraging those to walk.

895899   I am deeply disturbed that you are even considering adding an elementary school to the Williamsburg area. The
         traffic, congestion and danger to students is already unacceptable and adding another 600 students plus staff to
         support them is not safe or wise. During school events there is no parking in the area and I have seen many people
         park in yellow safety zones out of desperation...the safety of our children is at stake and no one seems to care.

895875   It is not safe for my 6th grade daughter to walk 1.4 miles to school. The distance is completly unacceptable. Especially
         in the winter when it is dark in the morning. She canot ride her bike due to an instrument for band. Last year several
         girls where flashed near Williamsburg - not safe at all. In the winter, people are not required to clear off their
         walkways. So we are just adding to the traffic congestion and pollution in driving - sad since I work for EPA.

897161   The longer the distance a female child has to walk the more risky it becomes. We live a mile and a half away, yet
         there is no school transportation. Before and after school there are hardly anyone on the streets to the school.
         Anyone who intends to harm our child could do so if she were to walk home alone.

895979   If I knew my child's bus route, he would go to a later bus stop on our route (we are the first, earliest stop) in the
         morning so that I could avoid driving to school. I have been unable to obtain this information from Transportation,
         although I have asked for it.

896072   The traffice(glebe) and major intersections would not allow me to send my child to school walking ect. dangerous!!!
         The time it would take to walk would mean the middle school kids would need to leave the house before 7 am and it
         would be dark during certain time in the year. Not safe for this age group. Currently not happy with the overcrowded
         bus stop/25middle schoolers/37 elemntary/ kids at a busy intersection with many speeding cars on 35th. The kids
         play in the street while waiting for the bus, so may kids on one corner/dangerous!!! 35th and N Thomas Street.
         Neighbors leaving for work( without kids) have ask permission to yell at them to get back on the curb in the morning.
         The kids leave at 7am and arrive at school 30-40 miutes later. This seems crazy when we live 1.8 miles from the
         school. This scene has made many parents drive their kids to school even though a bus is provided.




                                                                                                                      Page 19 of 20
896078   Traffic around the schools is WAY too heavy to allow small children to walk to school alone. Even in schools with very
         high parent participation (Jamestown), people block driveways, double park, park "around" corners, and generally
         operate vehicles in a very unsafe manner. With respect to Williamsburg, there is way too much traffic to allow children
         to walk to school. Harrison is extremely hazardous -- I jog by the school in the morning, and the backlog of cars
         coming in is horrific. I would never let my small children walk to elementary school on Harrison. The planned school
         needs to be moved to the other side of the site -- the 36th street side -- so that the traffic can flow better.

896254   Section 10/11 of the survey is badly designed. Son gets driven one way and walks home, so it is difficult to answer.
         Also the distance between WMS and our house is not going to change unless there is a very significant earthquake.
         Time - does this mean time of day or commuting time? Middle school starts so early (due to the bus shifts) that it is
         dark for portions of the year when you want my child to walk to school. I won't have him walking alone in the dark. Or
         on ice. We haven't seen any kids on our neighborhood who go to WMS so he has no-one to walk with. In the morning
         I want to be sure he made it to school. I don't want to wait until the afternoon to learn he never made it, hence I will
         continue to drive him to school. I grew up somewhere where we didn't have school buses, hence all schools in the city
         could start at the same time at a reasonable time. As long as you have buses, which mean that middle school starts
         far too early, I will continue to drive him to school. You stress the need for teenagers to get lots of sleep, but the
         change in the bus policy means that they have to get up so early if they are going to walk. By driving him, he gets an
         extra 30 mins sleep,which is healthy. The whole idea of property line to property line to measure distance is odd
         especially when APS delivers bus kids to the front door. Please measure to the spot where the buses drop the bus
         kids, or drop the bus kids at the school property line to be equitable. The whole idea that the kids kicked off the bus
         would walk is unrealistic - many of them are being driven now. The traffic is much worse. Also we live near another
         school, and it can take me three minutes to back out of my house in the morning because of all the "walkers" being
         driven to that school. I am very fearful about the traffic situation once construction begins at WMS for the new
         elementary school with the addition of dump trucks. There was talk at WMS that APS might change the bus routes/
         distance requirements once construction starts, as Falls Ch did at Dr McCarty's previous school. Will this be done?

896526   Arlington has changed enormously over the last few decades. We are no longer a sleepy community. Our roads are
         congested and traffic is heavy especially at the time kids are going to school. Children should not have to cross major
         interestcions to get to/from school. It is also a question of time for families. Parents do not have time to walk to/from
         school and get to work on time. Re: question 12, it's not a matter of "fun". In most Arlington families, both parents
         work outside the home, we cannot walk/bike with their kids to/from school. This question alone says the County is out
         of touch with the reality of family life tdoay in Arlington. And #14, yes walking is healthy but a 45 minute walk along
         major commuting roads is too risky. In a community our size, no child should have a commute to/from school, whether
         walking or busing, that is longer than a half hour. And no child should be standing or sitting on bus floors during the
         commute to school. This is totally unsafe and unacceptable.

896824   The volume and speed of the traffic and the size of the roads prohibit safe walking or biking for my kids. This survey
         does not allow people to comment on whether Harrison St is overcrowded at present, nor does it seem to want to
         measure a level of safety commensurate with the volume of traffic. I have witnessed a number of almost accidents on
         Harrison in the morning, when parents park on both sides of the road and there is a string of cars waiting to exit at
         Williamsburg. I would hope that a traffic survey would consider current realities.

897293   Both of our children went to W'burg and are now at Yorktown. I get at least 4 emails every year from the principal
         about perverts approaching children while walking to/from school, along with "helpful hints" to avoid these
         confrontations. Not to mention the bank robber who was shot by police on the W'burg playground while the kids were
         in lockdown. (If there was a sarcasm font, I'd use it.) And the highschooler robbed at gunpoint by the toddler park on
         Harrison a few weeks ago (though I recognize this was at 8 pm). This coupled with the heavy traffic (especially on
         Glebe and W'burg at rush hour which is when the kids would be biking/walking to school) there is no way in hell I'd
         allow my kids to walk/bike to school. Distance and weather have nothing to do with it. It's all about safety. By the way,
         questions 13 & 14 are leading and imply parents whose kids don't walk/bike are unconcerned about the health of
         their children. Question 15 is irrelevant - I can't imagine what weight that adds to a parent's opinion about
         transportation to school. That being said, if the bus service was discontinued due to budget concerns, I'll not whine
         about it - I'll simply drive our kids to/from school and won't that be a lovely traffic mess if other parents do the same -
         which is exactly what will happen. How about approaching the business community about sponsoring a bus - they
         could advertise on the outside of the vehicle. Tacky - but it's an option.

This report contains information from parents about their children's trip to and from school. The report also reflects
parents' perceptions regarding whether walking and bicycling to school is appropriate for their child. The data used in this
report were collected using the Survey about Walking and Biking to School for Parents form from the National Center for
Safe Routes to School.

Note:
--Factors are listed from most to least influential for the 'Child does not walk/bike to school' group.
--Each column may sum to > 100% because respondent could select more than issue
--The calculation used to determine the percentage for each issue is based on the 'Number of Respondents per Category' within
the respective columns (Child does not walk/bike to school and Child walks/bikes to school.) If comparing percentages between
the two columns, please pay particular attention to each column's number of respondents because the two numbers can differ
dramatically.

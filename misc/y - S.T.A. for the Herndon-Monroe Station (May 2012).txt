INTRODUCTION 

Washington  Metropolitan  Airports  Authority  (WMAA)/  Project  Management  Support  Services 
(PMSS)  initiated  this  study  to  serve  as  a  supplement  to  the  September  8,  2011  report  titled: 
Final  95%  PE  Traffic Circulation  Analysis  ­  Traffic  Analysis  Compendium, prepared  by  Dulles Rail 
Consultants.  The traffic analyses included in this Compendium assumed a new right in/right out 
(Alternative  2)  at  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  to  provide  access  to  the  proposed  HerndonMonroe 
Station garage.  As a result, the study included uturns along Sunrise Valley Drive, specifically at 
Roark Drive and Milburn Lane, in order to facilitate access to/from the new garage.  As a follow 
up  to  this  analyses,  MWAA/PMSS  had  prepared  this  supplemental  study  in  order  to  evaluate 
the  traffic  impacts  of  prohibiting  uturns  along  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  at  Roark  Drive  and  Milburn 
Lane,  respectively,  as  well  as  at  the  internal  intersection  of  Station  Entrance  (Roark  Drive 
extension)/Garage  Entrance.    The  study  evaluates  the  traffic  impacts,  with  and  without  the 
aforementioned  uturns,  on  the  road  network  surrounding  the  proposed  HerndonMonroe 
Station. 

Figure  1  is  provided  to  illustrate  the  location  of  study  area  intersections  with  respect  to  the 
surrounding roadway network.

EXISTING CONDITIONS 
 


Sunrise  Valley  Drive  and  Roark  Drive/HerndonMonroe  Park  &  Ride  Entrance  is  a  fourlegged 
signalized  intersection  located  in  Fairfax  County,  Virginia.    The  HerndonMonroe  Park  &  Ride 
Entrance  (the  north  approach)  provides  primary  access  to  the  HerndonMonroe  Bus  Station.   
Roark  Drive  (the  south  approach)  serves  a  residential  community.    Adjacent  intersections 
include HerndonMonroe Park & Ride lot and existing Garage Entrance to the north and Sunrise 
Valley  Drive  and  Milburn  Lane  to  the  west.    Both  intersections  are  fourlegged  unsignalized 
intersections.   Within  the  vicinity  of  the  site,  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  is  a  fourlane  divided  arterial 
with a posted speed limit of 35 mph.  Photographs are provided below depicting each approach 
to the study intersections.

DESIGN YEAR 2030 TRAFFIC ANALYSES 
 


MWAA/PMSS  collected  weekday  AM  (79  AM)  and  PM  (46  PM)  peak  hour  turning  movement 
traffic counts at the intersections of Sunrise Valley Drive and Milburn Lane, Sunrise Valley Drive 
and  Roark  Drive/Station  Entrance  (formerly  HerndonMonroe  Park  &  Ride  Entrance),  Station 
Entrance  and  Garage  Entrance,  and  Station  Entrance  and  Bus  Loop  in  December  of  2011 
(included  in  the  Appendix  section  of  this  report).   MWAA/PMSS  obtained  the  Design  Year  2030 
AM  and  PM  peak  hour  turning  movement  traffic  counts  at  these  intersections  from  the 
September  8,  2011  report  titled:  Final  95%  PE  Traffic  Circulation  Analysis  ­  Traffic  Analysis 
Compendium.   In  order  to  evaluate  the  network  assuming  uturn  restrictions,  the  eastbound  u
turns  along  Sunrise  Valley  Drive,  at  Roark  Drive/Station  Entrance,  were  rerouted  to  the  left
turn  movement  in  order  to  access  the  Station  via  the  intersection  of  Station  Entrance/Garage 
Entrance.  Figure 2 is provided to show the Design Year 2030 AM/PM peak hour modified traffic 
volumes (without uturns).

MWAA/PMSS  evaluated  the  traffic  operations  at  the  study  intersections  assuming  the  Design 
Year  2030  AM/PM  peak  hour  traffic  volumes  shown  on  Figure  2.    Accordingly,  analyses  were 
performed  "with"  and  "without"  the  aforementioned  uturns  along  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  using 
Synchro/SimTraffic  capacity  analysis  software.   The  Measures  of  Effectiveness  (MOE)  results  of 
Levels  of  Service  (LOS),  vehicle  delay  and  95th  percentile  back  of  queue  were  established  based 
on  five  (5)  simulation  runs  of  SimTraffic  (15  minutes  seeding,  60  minutes  recording).    Cycle 
length,  phasing  sequence  and  other  Synchro  parameters  are  consistent  with  the  September 
2011  Compendium.   All  SimTraffic  analyses  worksheets  are  included  in  the  Appendix  section  of 
this report. 
 



Figures  3A  and  3B  illustrate  the  intersection  lane  geometry  and  AM/PM  peak  hour  LOS  for 
Design  Year  2030  with  and  without  uturns  at  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  and  Roark  Drive/Station 
Entrance.

CONCLUSION 
 


Assuming  2030  Design  Year  traffic  volumes,  the  intersections  of  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  and  New 
Garage  Entrance,  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  and  Roark  Drive/Station  Entrance,  and  Station  Entrance 
and  Garage  Entrance  would  operate  with  overall  AM/PM  peak  hour  LOS  "C"  or  better  (as 
shown  in  Figure  3  as  well  as  Tables  1A  &  1B)  with  or  without  the  eastbound  uturn  movement 
at  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  and  Roark  Drive/Station  Entrance.   The  elimination  of  the  uturns  would 
result  in  a  slight  reduction  in  back  of  queue  and  delay  for  the  eastbound  leftturn  movement 
along Sunrise Valley Drive.  However, the back of queue for the northbound left/through shared 
movement  at  the  intersection  of  Station  Entrance  and  Garage  Entrance  would  increase  from 
138  feet  in  the  "with  uturn"  scenario  to  260  feet  in  "without  uturn"  scenario  in  AM  peak.   
Based on the analyses results, it is concluded that prohibiting uturns along Sunrise Valley Drive 
would have minimal impact on the traffic operations at the intersections of Sunrise Valley Drive 
and  Roark  Drive/Station  Entrance,  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  and  New  Garage  Entrance,  and  Station 
Entrance and Garage Entrance.    

 

To  accommodate  the  aforementioned  cutthrough  traffic  resulting  from  the  elimination  of  u
turns, a conceptual plan was developed that would provide access from H. M. Park & Ride Drive 
to the new station garage via the caronly lane (loop) located north of the existing garage.  This 
lane will be extended to the west to connect to the proposed New Garage Driveway as depicted 
in  Figure  4A.   Under  this  alternative,  access  to  the  new  garage  via  the  existing  garage  would  be 
prohibited.   

Figure  4B  presents  an  alternative  conceptual  plan  in  which  access  to  the  new  garage  would  be 
provided  via  improved  "cutthru"  travel  lanes  through  the  existing  garage.   As  shown  in  Figure 
4b,  mitigation  measures  such  as  eradication/modification  of  pavement  markings,  revised 
parking  layout  and  installation  of  speed  humps  are  proposed  to  accommodate  the  increase  in 
traffic volumes.

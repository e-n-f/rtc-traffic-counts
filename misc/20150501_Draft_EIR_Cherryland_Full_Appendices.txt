Re:                Notice of Preparation (NOP) of an Environmental Impact Report
                   (EIR) for the Cherryland Community Center Project

The County of Alameda (Lead Agency) will prepare an EIR for the proposed Cherryland
Community Center project (Project). This Notice of Preparation (NOP) is being distributed
to applicable responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and interested parties as required by
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Comments from agencies and interested
parties are requested as to the scope and content of the environmental review in
connection with the proposed Project. The Project location and project description are
summarized below.

Project Location: The Project site is located at 278 Hampton Road (APN 413-35-010),
17482 Boston Road (APN 413-35-14-03), and the Meek Estate Park parking lot (APN 413-
35-19-2) in the community of Cherryland in unincorporated Alameda County. The
Community Center would be constructed on two parcels totaling 56,968 square feet or
approximately 1.3 acres. The total Project area including the existing parking lot is
approximately 2.2 acres. Figure 1 and 2 illustrate the regional and Project site location and
boundaries.

The T-shaped Community Center site is bounded on the south by two-lane Hampton Road
and on the west by Boston Road. The Project would also be located on the Meek Estate
Park parking lot, a separate parcel, which is located and accessed from the end of the
Boston Road cul-de-sac. Residential properties are located to the east, north, and west of
the Community Center parcels and to the south of the Meek Estate Park parking lot parcel.

Proposed Project: The proposed Project involves the demolition of an existing structure
and concrete pads on the Project site, construction of the new 17,500 square feet
Cherryland Community Center, and reconfiguration and improvements to the existing



Cherryland Community Center Project                                                   Page 1
County of Alameda                                                          February 9, 2015


Meek Estate Park parking lot. Alameda County has partnered with Hayward Area
Recreation & Park District (HARD) to design and construct the Cherryland Community
Center. The facility would be owned by Alameda County and once construction is
completed, HARD would be responsible for the ongoing programming, operations, and
maintenance of the Cherryland Community Center.

The Project’s expressed goal is to provide a gathering place and community focal point for
local residents of all ages. The facility would include a lobby/reception gathering space
area, a 5,000 square feet Community Event Room with adjoining courtyard and
commercial kitchen, three (3) Multiple Activity Rooms, a Satellite Library, and additional
space for pre-K facilities; all surrounded by active outdoor use areas and generous
plantings. The Project would provide space for a number of uses including wedding
receptions, lectures, performances, speaking engagements; yoga, art and exercise
classes; reading programs, library and computer/technology access; and a diverse array
of educational and recreational classes.

The Cherryland Community Center would be comprised of a single-story structure with
wooden trusses, glazed windows with sun-screening, and a series of canopies would
provide an open and bright sensibility to the spaces. The Project would include light
monitors (windows located along the roof line), a hearth in the lobby, and morning and
afternoon porches to create comfortable spaces for the community. Spaces within the
building would frame views to a series of courtyards with intimate seating, Bay-Friendly
plantings, and non-fruiting trees in reference to the nearby Meek Estate. The Project would
include site lighting, stormwater treatment features, and accommodate fire and emergency
access per County code. A site plan for the building is shown in Figure 3.

Access to the Project would be provided from Boston Road and Hampton Road. On-site
parking for 20 automobiles would be provided on the Hampton Road parcel. Additional off-
site parking for special events would be provided in the existing, re-configured Meek
Estate Park parking lot, located north of the Community Center on Boston Road. This
existing parking lot would be reconfigured as part of the proposed Project to provide
parking for 104 vehicles and would provide enhanced pedestrian connections to the
Community Center, providing a total of 124 spaces to accommodate the Project,.
Additional improvements to the parking lot include installation of storm water treatment
devices, screening for adjacent residential properties, improved site lighting, and
pedestrian and vehicular circulation improvements.

Estimated Project construction is scheduled to start during the summer of 2015 and be
completed by the fall of 2016.

Probable Environmental Effects: Based on the project description and the Lead
Agency’s understanding of the environmental issues associated with the Project, the
following topics will be analyzed in the EIR, including: Aesthetics, Air Quality/Greenhouse
Gases, Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, Geology and Soils, Hazards and
Hazardous Materials, Hydrology and Water Quality, Land Use/Planning, Noise, Public
Services and Recreation, Transportation/Traffic, and Utilities and Service Systems. No
agricultural or mineral resources are located on the site and the Project would not
generate an increase in population in the County; therefore, agricultural resources, mineral
resources, and population and housing will be only briefly addressed in the EIR. The

               Geotechnical Investigation
               Cherryland Community Center
               278 Hampton Road/17482 Boston Road
               Cherryland, California

Dear Mr. Laczko,

Attached is our final geotechnical report, April 4, 2014, for the proposed Cherryland
Community Center to be constructed in Cherryland, California. Our services were
provided in accordance with our Professional Services Contract with the County of
Alameda, dated September 17, 2013.

The project site is comprised of two adjacent parcels at 278 Hampton Road and 17482
Boston Road. The 278 Hampton Road parcel is relatively level and is currently a vacant
lot with several mature trees. It is partly covered with asphalt concrete pavement and
concrete pads associated with previous development on the site. Based on our review of
historic photographs available on Google Earth, it appears three structures previously
occupied the 278 Hampton Road site, including a residence in the front half of the site
and two long rectangular structures in the rear half of the site. The 17482 Boston Road
parcel slopes up very gently to the east and is currently occupied by a vacant 1- to 2-story
residence with a small front and backyard.

Plans are to construct a 20,000-square-foot, one-story community center on the site. The
currently proposed building layout consists of three buildings along the west and north
sides of the 278 Hampton Road parcel and one building on the north side of the 17482
Boston Road parcel. We anticipate the buildings will be framed in wood or light-gauge
metal and will have concrete slab-on-grade floors located near existing grades. Structural
design loads were not available at the time this report was prepared; however, we expect
the loads will be light as is typical for these types of structures. We anticipate

improvements on the remainder of the two parcels will include parking areas, concrete
flatwork, new utilities, and landscaping.

From a geotechnical standpoint, we conclude the site can be developed as planned,
provided the recommendations presented in this report are incorporated into the project
plans and specifications and implemented during construction. The site is underlain by
up to about 15 feet of sandy silt, silty sand, and sand. The upper sandy silt layer is
susceptible to severe collapse when wetted under moderate loading. The underlying
loose to medium dense sand and silty sand is susceptible to cyclic densification during a
major earthquake, which will result in settlement of improvements supported at grade.
Spread footing foundations bearing on the collapsible sandy silt in its existing condition
may experience excessive static settlement when the soil is wetted from irrigation or
other sources. The potential for settlement due to wetting can be mitigated, however, by
overexcavating and compacting the sandy silt. Therefore, we conclude the proposed
buildings may be supported on spread footings bearing on recompacted soil (engineered
fill). Specific recommendations for compaction of the engineered fill and other
geotechnical aspects of the project are presented herein.

The recommendations contained in our report are based on a limited subsurface
exploration. Consequently, variations between expected and actual subsurface conditions
may be found in localized areas during construction. Therefore, we should be engaged to
observe site grading and foundation installation during which time we may make changes
in our recommendations, if deemed necessary.

We appreciate the opportunity to provide our services to you on this project. If you have
any questions, please call.

1.0      INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of the geotechnical investigation performed by Rockridge
Geotechnical, Inc. for the proposed Cherryland Community Center to be constructed in
Cherryland, California. The site is located on the north side of Hampton Road between Boston
Road and Standish Avenue, as shown on the Site Location Map (Figure 1).

The project site is comprised of two adjacent parcels at 278 Hampton Road and 17482 Boston
Road. The 278 Hampton Road parcel is relatively level and is currently a vacant lot with several
mature trees. It is partly covered with asphalt concrete pavement and concrete pads associated
with previous development on the site. Based on our review of historic photographs available on
Google Earth, it appears three structures previously occupied the 278 Hampton Road site,
including a residence in the front half of the site and two long rectangular structures in the rear
half of the site. The 17482 Boston Road parcel slopes up very gently to the east and is currently
occupied by a vacant 1- to 2-story residence with a small front and backyard.

Plans are to construct a 20,000-square-foot, one-story community center on the site. The
currently proposed building layout, which is shown on Figure 2, consists of three buildings along
the west and north sides of the 278 Hampton Road parcel and one building on the north side of
the 17482 Boston Road parcel. We anticipate the buildings will be framed in wood or light-
gauge metal and will have concrete slab-on-grade floors located near existing grades. Structural
design loads were not available at the time this report was prepared; however, we expect the
loads will be light as is typical for these types of structures. We anticipate improvements on the
remainder of the two parcels will include parking areas, concrete flatwork, new utilities, and
landscaping.

2.0       SCOPE OF WORK

Our geotechnical investigation was performed in accordance with our proposal dated September
13, 2013 and our Professional Services Contract with the County of Alameda, dated September
17, 2013. Our scope of services consisted of exploring subsurface conditions at the site by
drilling five test borings and advancing two cone penetration tests (CPTs), and performing
laboratory testing and engineering analyses to develop conclusions and recommendations
regarding:

         site seismicity and seismic hazards, including the potential for liquefaction and lateral
          spreading, and total and differential settlement resulting from liquefaction and/or cyclic
          densification
         the most appropriate foundation type for the proposed structures
         design criteria for the recommended foundation type(s), including vertical and lateral
          capacities
         estimates of foundation settlement under static and seismic conditions
         site grading and excavation, including criteria for fill quality and compaction
         subgrade preparation for interior and exterior concrete slabs-on-grade
         corrosivity of the near-surface soil and the potential effects on buried concrete and metal
          structures and foundations
         flexible (asphalt concrete) and rigid (Portland cement concrete) pavement design
         2013 California Building Code (CBC) site class and design spectral response acceleration
          parameters
         construction considerations.


3.0       FIELD INVESTIGATION

Subsurface conditions at the site were explored by drilling five test borings and advancing two
CPTs at the approximate locations shown on Figure 2. Prior to advancing the test borings and
CPTs, we obtained a drilling permit from the Alameda County Public Works Agency (ACPWA).
We also contacted Underground Service Alert (USA) to notify them of our work, as required by
law and retained a private utility locator, Precision Locating, LLC, to confirm the borings and




13-590                                             2                                        April 4, 2014
CPT locations were clear of existing utilites. We also performed infiltration testing of the near-
surface at three locations selected by the project team to provide information for design of bio-
retention areas.

3.1       Test Borings

Five test borings, designated as Borings B-1 through B-5, were drilled on November 20, 2013 by
Exploration GeoServices of San Jose, California at the approximate locations shown on Figure 2.
The borings were each drilled to a depth of 26-1/2 feet below the existing ground surface (bgs)
using a truck-mounted drill rig equipped with eight-inch-diameter hollow-stem augers. During
drilling, our field engineer logged the soil encountered and obtained representative samples for
visual classification and laboratory testing. The boring logs are presented on Figures A-1
through A-5 in Appendix A. The soil encountered in the borings was classified in accordance
with the classification chart presented on Figure A-6 in Appendix A.

Soil samples were obtained using the following samplers:

         Sprague and Henwood (S&H) split-barrel sampler with a 3.0-inch outside diameter and
          2.5-inch inside diameter, lined with 2.43-inch inside diameter brass tubes.
         Standard Penetration Test (SPT) split-barrel sampler with a 2.0-inch outside and 1.5-inch
          inside diameter, without liners.

The samplers were driven with a 140-pound, downhole wireline hammer falling about 30 inches
per drop. Dynamic testing performed on this hammer by GRL Engineers, Inc. on April 5, 2013
indicates the average energy transfer ratio for this hammer is 37 percent. The samplers were 18
inches at each sample depth and the hammer blows required to drive the samplers were recorded
every six inches and are presented on the boring logs. A “blow count” is defined as the number
of hammer blows per six inches of penetration or 50 blows for six inches or less of penetration.
The blow counts required to drive the S&H and SPT samplers were converted to approximate
SPT N-values using factors of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, to account for sampler type and
approximate hammer energy. The blow counts used for this conversion were the last two blow
counts. The converted SPT N-values are presented on the boring logs.

Upon completion of drilling, the boreholes were backfilled with cement grout under the
observation of the ACPWA inspector. The soil cuttings generated by the borings spread on the
ground surface next to the borings.

3.2      Cone Penetration Tests

Two CPTs, designated as CPT-1 and CPT-2, were performed to provide in-situ soil data at the
approximate locations shown on Figure 2. John Sarmiento & Associates of Orinda, California
advanced the CPTs on November 20, 2013, each to a depth of 50 feet bgs.

The CPTs were performed by hydraulically pushing a 1.4-inch-diameter cone-tipped probe with
a projected area of 10 square centimeters into the ground. The cone-tipped probe measured tip
resistance and the friction sleeve behind the cone tip measured frictional resistance. Electrical
strain gauges within the cone continuously measured soil parameters for the entire depth
advanced. Soil data, including tip resistance and frictional resistance, were recorded by a
computer while the test was conducted. Accumulated data were processed by computer to
provide engineering information such as the types and approximate strength characteristics of the
soil encountered. The CPT logs, showing tip resistance and friction ratio by depth, as well as
interpreted SPT N-values, soil shear strength parameters, and soil classifications, are presented in
Appendix A on Figures A-7 and A-8. Upon completion, the CPTs were backfilled with cement
grout.

3.3      Laboratory Testing

We re-examined the soil samples obtained from our borings to confirm the field classifications
and select representative samples for laboratory testing. Soil samples were tested to measure
moisture content, dry density, fines content (i.e., particles passing the No. 200 sieve), collapse
potential, corrosivity, and resistance value (R-value). The results of the laboratory tests are
presented on the boring logs and in Appendix B.

3.4      Infiltration Testing

To provide information on the infiltration rate (i.e., permeability) of the near-surface soil, we
performed infiltration tests on March 7, 2014 at the three locations designated as I-1 through I-3
on Figure 2. The infiltration tests were performed at the bottom of two-foot-square test pits
excavated to a depth of approximately two feet bgs. The soil exposed at the bottom of the test
pits consisted of sandy silt with some clay at the I-1 and I-3 locations and silty sand at the I-2
location. To check whether a soil with higher permeability was present below the relatively low-
permeability near-surface soil, we hand-augered a boring to a depth of seven feet bgs about five
feet horizontally from the infiltration test locations. At all three locations, the soil type was
relatively uniform to a depth of seven feet bgs.

We performed the infiltration tests using a 12-inch-diameter single-ring infiltrometer. The space
between the test pit walls and the infiltrometer was filled with water to the same level as the
water inside the infiltrometer to prevent seepage around the edge of the infiltrometer. The
infiltration rate at the I-1 location ranged from about 0.3 to 1 inch/hour for the first 2-1/4 hours
of the test while the soil below the test pit was being saturated; however, the rate slowed to
essentially zero for the next hour (i.e., after saturation). At the I-3 location, the infiltration rate
was essentially zero throughout the hour-long test period and, therefore, the test was terminated.
At the I-2 location, the initial infiltration rate was as high as 7 inches/hour, but the rate gradually
slowed as the soil became saturated. After about 2-1/2 hours, a steady infiltration rate of 1.9
inches per hour was measured.


4.0      SUBSURFACE CONDITIONS

The project site, as shown on Figure 5, is underlain by Holocene-age (11,000 years old to recent)
natural alluvial fan levee deposits associated with flooding of nearby San Lorenzo Creek. Our
borings and CPTs indicate the site is blanketed by approximately 10 to 15 feet of slightly moist,
medium stiff to stiff, non-plastic sandy silt and loose to medium dense sand and silty sand.




13-590                                              5                                        April 4, 2014
Laboratory collapse potential tests indicate the upper sandy silt layer is susceptible to severe
collapse when saturated under moderate loading.

The sandy silt/silty sand is underlain by stiff to very stiff clay and sandy clay of low to moderate
plasticity interbedded with occasional layers of medium dense to dense sand and silty sand.
These sand and silty sand layers are generally thin (less than two feet thick), except at CPT-2,
where dense sand was encountered between depths of 43 and 50 feet bgs, the maximum depth
explored.

Groundwater was not encountered in the borings, which were each drilled to a depth of 26.5 feet
bgs. Groundwater was measured at depths of approximately 30 and 27 feet bgs in CPT-1 and
CPT-2, respectively. To estimate the depth of the historically high groundwater, we reviewed
the publication by the California Geological Survey titled Seismic Hazard Zone Report for the
Hayward 7.5-Minute Quadrangle, Alameda County, California (2003). According to Plate 1.2 in
the report, the depth to the historically high groundwater in the immediate site vicinity is 20 feet
bgs. We anticipate the depth to groundwater varies several feet seasonally, depending on rainfall
amounts.


5.0      SEISMIC CONSIDERATIONS

5.1      Regional Seismicity

The site is located in the Coast Ranges geomorphic province of California that is characterized
by northwest-trending valleys and ridges. These topographic features are controlled by folds and
faults that resulted from the collision of the Farallon plate and North American plate and
subsequent strike-slip faulting along the San Andreas Fault system. The San Andreas Fault is
more than 600 miles long from Point Arena in the north to the Gulf of California in the south.
The Coast Ranges province is bounded on the east by the Great Valley and on the west by the
Pacific Ocean.

The major active faults in the area are the Hayward, San Andreas, Calaveras, and San Gregorio
faults. These and other faults in the region are shown on Figure 4. For these and other active
faults within a 50-kilometer radius of the site, the distance from the site and estimated mean
characteristic Moment magnitude1 [2007 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities
(WGCEP) (USGS 2008) and Cao et al. (2003)] are summarized in Table 1.

Since 1800, four major earthquakes have been recorded on the San Andreas Fault. In 1836, an
earthquake with an estimated maximum intensity of VII on the Modified Mercalli (MM) scale
occurred east of Monterey Bay on the San Andreas Fault (Toppozada and Borchardt 1998). The
estimated Moment magnitude, Mw, for this earthquake is about 6.25. In 1838, an earthquake
occurred with an estimated intensity of about VIII-IX (MM), corresponding to an Mw of about
7.5. The San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 caused the most significant damage in the history of
the Bay Area in terms of loss of lives and property damage. This earthquake created a surface
rupture along the San Andreas Fault from Shelter Cove to San Juan Bautista approximately 470
kilometers in length. It had a maximum intensity of XI (MM), an Mw of about 7.9, and was felt
560 kilometers away in Oregon, Nevada, and Los Angeles. The most recent earthquake to affect
the Bay Area was the Loma Prieta Earthquake of 17 October 1989 with an Mw of 6.9. This
earthquake occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains about 75 kilometers south of the site.

In 1868, an earthquake with an estimated maximum intensity of X on the MM scale occurred on
the southern segment (between San Leandro and Fremont) of the Hayward Fault. The estimated
Mw for the earthquake is 7.0. In 1861, an earthquake of unknown magnitude (probably an Mw of
about 6.5) was reported on the Calaveras Fault. The most recent significant earthquake on this
fault was the 1984 Morgan Hill earthquake (Mw = 6.2).

The U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) 2007 WGCEP has compiled the earthquake fault research
for the San Francisco Bay area in order to estimate the probability of fault segment rupture.
They have determined that the overall probability of moment magnitude 6.7 or greater
earthquake occurring in the San Francisco Bay Region during the next thirty years is 63 percent.
The highest probabilities are assigned to the Hayward/Rodgers Creek Fault and the northern
segment of the San Andreas Fault. These probabilities are 31 and 21 percent, respectively
(USGS 2008).

5.2       Geologic Hazards

Because the project site is in a seismically active region, we evaluated the potential for
earthquake-induced geologic hazards including ground shaking, ground surface rupture,
liquefaction,2 lateral spreading,3 and cyclic densification4. We used the results of our field
investigation to evaluate the potential of these phenomena occurring at the project site.


5.2.1 Ground Shaking

The ground shaking intensity felt at the project site will depend on: 1) the size of the earthquake
(magnitude), 2) the distance from the site to the fault source, 3) the directivity (focusing of
earthquake energy along the fault in the direction of the rupture), and 4) subsurface conditions.
The site is about two kilometers from the Hayward Fault. Therefore, the potential exists for a
large earthquake to induce strong to very strong ground shaking at the site during the life of the
project.


5.2.2 Ground Surface Rupture

Historically, ground surface displacements closely follow the trace of geologically young faults.
The site is not within an Earthquake Fault Zone, as defined by the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zoning Act, and no known active or potentially active faults exist on the site. We therefore
conclude the risk of fault offset at the site from a known active fault is very low. In a seismically
active area, the remote possibility exists for future faulting in areas where no faults previously
existed; however, we conclude the risk of surface faulting and consequent secondary ground
failure from previously unknown faults is also very low.

      Liquefaction is a phenomenon where loose, saturated, cohesionless soil experiences temporary
      reduction in strength during cyclic loading such as that produced by earthquakes.
3
      Lateral spreading is a phenomenon in which surficial soil displaces along a shear zone that has
      formed within an underlying liquefied layer. Upon reaching mobilization, the surficial blocks are
      transported downslope or in the direction of a free face by earthquake and gravitational forces.
4
      Cyclic densification is a phenomenon in which non-saturated, cohesionless soil is compacted by
      earthquake vibrations, causing ground-surface settlement.

5.2.3    Cyclic Densification

Seismically induced compaction or cyclic densification of non-saturated sand (sand above the
groundwater table) caused by earthquake vibrations may result in differential settlement. Based
on the subsurface data from our field investigations, we conclude the sandy silty, silty sand and
sand above the groundwater table is susceptible to cyclic densification during a major
earthquake. With no recompaction of the upper five feet of soil, we estimate ground surface
settlement of up to two inches could occur due to cyclic densification during a Magnitude 7.33
earthquake generating a peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.89 times gravity (g); this peak
ground acceleration is consistent with the Maximum Considered Earthquake Geometric Mean
(MCEG) peak ground acceleration adjusted for site effects (PGAM). If the upper five feet of soil
is overexcavated and recompacted, as recommended in Section 6.1 below, we estimate total
settlement associated with cyclic densification would be less than 1-1/2 inches and differential
settlement would be less than ¾ inch over a horizontal distance of 30 feet. It should be noted the
computed cyclic densification settlement for a Magnitude 7.33 earthquake and a PGA of 0.6g is
less than ½ inch.


5.2.4    Liquefaction and Associated Hazards

Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which saturated soil temporarily loses strength from the build-
up of excess pore water pressure, especially during earthquake-induced cyclic loading. Soil
susceptible to liquefaction includes loose to medium dense sand and gravel, low-plasticity silt,
and some low-plasticity clay deposits. Flow failure, lateral spreading, differential settlement,
loss of bearing strength, ground fissures and sand boils are evidence of excess pore pressure
generation and liquefaction. We evaluated liquefaction potential at the site using the data
collected in our CPTs. Our liquefaction analysis using CPT data was performed using
methodology proposed by P.K. Robertson (2009).

As shown on Figure 5, the site has been mapped within a zone of liquefaction potential on the
map titled State of California, Sesimic Hazard Zones, Hayward Quadrangle, Official Map,




13-590                                          10                                       April 4, 2014
prepared by the Californa Geological Survey (CGS), dated July 2, 2003. Special Publication 117
by the California Geological Survey (2008) recommends subsurface investigations in mapped
liquefaction potential areas be performed using rotary-wash borings and/or cone penetration
tests.

Our analysis was performed using a groundwater depth of 20 feet bgs, which is consistent with
the historically high groundwater for the site vicinity. In accordance with the 2013 CBC, we
used a peak ground acceleration of 0.89 times gravity (g) in our liquefaction evaluation; this peak
ground acceleration is consistent with the Maximum Considered Earthquake Geometric Mean
(MCEG) peak ground acceleration adjusted for site effects (PGAM). We also used a Moment
magnitude 7.33 earthquake, which is consistent with the mean characteristic Moment magnitude
for the Hayward Fault, as presented in Table 1. A summary of the liquefaction analysis is
presented in Appendix C of this report.

At the CPT-1 location, thin potentially liquefiable soil layers or lenses were encountered between
depths of 23 and 48 feet feet bgs at the site. These layers are typically less than one foot thick.
We estimate ground-surface settlement associated with post-liquefaction reconsolidation of these
layers could be up to 0.6 inches. Our analysis indicates the potential for liquefaction to occur at
the CPT-2 location is low. We estimate differential settlement associated with liquefaction could
be up to ¼ inch over a horizontal distance of 30 feet.

Lateral spreading occurs when a continuous layer of soil liquefies at depth and the soil layers
above move toward an unsupported face, such as a shoreline slope, or in the direction of a
regional slope or gradient. Based on the discontinuous nature and depth of the potentially
liquefiable layers, we conclude the potential for lateral spreading to occur at the project site is
very low.

6.0      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Based on the results of our geotechnical investigation, we conclude the proposed project can be
developed as planned. The primary geotechnical concern is the presence of collapsible sandy silt
blanketing the site. This and other geotechnical concerns are discussed in the following sections.


6.1      Foundation Support and Settlement

The site is underlain by up to about 15 feet of sandy silt, silty sand, and sand. The upper sandy
silt layer is susceptible to severe collapse when wetted under moderate loading. The underlying
loose to medium dense sand and silty sand is susceptible to cyclic densification during a major
earthquake, which will result in settlement of improvements supported at grade. Spread footing
foundations bearing on the collapsible sandy silt in its existing condition may experience
excessive static settlement when the soil is wetted from irrigation or other sources. The potential
for settlement due to wetting can be mitigated, however, by overexcavating and compacting the
sandy silt. Therefore, we conclude the proposed buildings may be supported on spread footings
bearing on recompacted soil (engineered fill). The engineered fill should extend at least five feet
below the existing ground surface. Recommendations for engineered fill quality and compaction
are presented in Section 7.1.

Our settlement analyses indicate total settlement of spread footings bearing on engineered fill,
designed using the allowable bearing pressures presented in Section 7.2 of this report, will be on
the order of ½ inch and differential settlement will be less than ¼ inch over a 30-foot horizontal
distance. An additional two inches of total settlement and one inch of differential settlement
over a horizontal distance of 30 feet may occur due to a combination of cyclic densification and
post-liquefaction reconsolidation during the Maximum Credible Earthquake (i.e., PGA of 0.89g).
During a Magnitude 7.33 earthquake generating a PGA of 0.6g, the estimated seismically
induced total settlement is less than one inch and the differential settlement is about ½ inch over
a horizontal distance of 30 feet.

6.2      Construction Considerations

The soil to be excavated for the new foundations and underground utilities is expected to be
predominantly sandy silt, which is highly susceptible to “pumping” (i.e., excessive deflection
under wheel loads) when compacted at a high moisture content. If site grading is performed
during the rainy season, the sandy silt will likely have to be dried before compaction can be
achieved. Heavy rubber-tired equipment could cause pumping of the sandy silt and, therefore,
should be avoided if grading occurs during the rainy season.

Excavations that will be deeper than five feet and will be entered by workers should be sloped or
shored in accordance with CAL-OSHA standards (29 CFR Part 1926). The contractor should be
responsible for the construction and safety of temporary slopes.


6.3      Soil Corrosivity

Corrosivity testing was performed by Sunland Analytical of Rancho Cordova, California on a
sample of soil obtained during our field investigation from a depth of 3 feet bgs. The results of
the test are presented in Appendix B of this report. Based on the resistivity test results, the
sample would be classified as moderately corrosive to buried steel, which is typical of fine-
grained soil. Accordingly, buried iron, steel, cast iron, galvanized steel, and dielectric-coated
steel or iron should be properly protected against corrosion. The results indicate that sulfate ion
concentrations are insufficient to damage reinforced concrete structures below ground, and the
chloride concentration of the soil does not present a problem with reinforcing steel in buried
concrete structures.

7.0       RECOMMENDATIONS

Our recommendations for site preparation and grading, design of foundations, and other
geotechnical aspects of the project are presented in this section.


7.1       Site Preparation and Grading

Site clearing should include removal of all existing foundations, slabs, pavements, and
underground utilities. Any vegetation and the upper 3 to 4 inches of organic topsoil should be
stripped in areas to receive improvements. Tree roots with a diameter greater than 1/2 inch
within three feet of subgrade should also be removed. Removed asphalt concrete and concrete
should be taken to a recycling facility.

After site clearing is completed, the proposed building pads should be excavated to a depth of at
least five feet below existing site grades and at least three feet below the bottom of proposed
footings, whichever is deeper. If the embedment depth of a particular footing results in an
overexcavation deeper than five feet below existing site grades, the three-foot overexcavation
beneath that footing can be limited to an area extending beneath and three feet beyond the edges
of the footing.

Any areas to receive pavement or concrete flatwork, including sidewalks, should be excavated to
at least three feet below existing grades. The excavations should extend at least five feet beyond
the perimeters of the proposed buildings and at least three feet beyond the edges of pavement and
flatwork, except where constrained by property lines or existing utilities. The exposed subgrade
at the base of the excavations should be scarified to a depth of at least eight inches, moisture-
conditioned to above optimum moisture content, and compacted to at least 92 percent relative
compaction5. The excavated material should then be placed in lifts not exceeding eight inches in


5
      Relative compaction refers to the in-place dry density of soil expressed as a percentage of the
      maximum dry density of the same material, as determined by the ASTM D1557 laboratory
      compaction procedure.


13-590                                                14                                         April 4, 2014
loose thickness, moisture-conditioned to above optimum moisture content, and compacted to at
least 92 percent relative compaction.

Subgrade soil consisting of clean sand or gravel (defined as soil with less than 10 percent fines
by weight) should be compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction. Soil subgrade for
vehicular pavements should be compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction and be non-
yielding. The soil subgrade should be kept moist until it is covered by fill for improvements.


7.1.1    Fill Quality

Material excavated at the site will primarily consist of non-plastic sandy silt and silty sand that
may be reused as fill, provided it is free or organic matter and contain no rocks or lumps greater
than three inches in greatest dimension. If imported fill (select fill) is required, it should be free
of organic matter, contain no rocks or lumps larger than three inches in greatest dimension, have
a liquid limit less than 40 and plasticity index less than 12, and be approved by the Geotechnical
Engineer. Samples of proposed select fill material should be submitted to the Geotechnical
Engineer at least three business days prior to use at the site. The grading contractor should
provide analytical test results or other suitable environmental documentation indicating the
imported fill is free of hazardous materials at least three days before use at the site. If this data is
not available, up to two weeks should be allowed to perform analytical testing on the proposed
imported material.

7.1.2    Utility Trenches

Excavations for utility trenches can be readily made with a backhoe. All trenches should
conform to the current CAL-OSHA requirements. Excavations in areas where recompacted fill
is placed should stand vertically. For trenches excavated outside the recompacted fill areas, we
anticipate that some caving may occur in the relatively dry sandy silt.

Backfill for utility trenches and other excavations is also considered fill, and it should be
compacted according to the recommendations presented in Section 7.1. Jetting of trench backfill



13-590                                            15                                        April 4, 2014
should not be permitted. Special care should be taken when backfilling utility trenches in
pavement areas. Poor compaction may cause excessive settlements, resulting in damage to the
pavement section.

To provide uniform support, pipes or conduits should be bedded on a minimum of four inches of
sand or fine gravel. After the pipes and conduits are tested, inspected (if required) and approved,
they should be covered to a depth of six inches with sand or fine gravel, which should be
mechanically tamped.

Foundations for the proposed buildings should be bottomed below an imaginary line extending
up at a 1.5:1 (horizontal to vertical) inclination from the base of utility trenches. Alternatively,
the portion of the utility trench (excluding bedding) that is below the 1.5:1 line can be backfilled
with controlled low-strength material (CLSM) with a 28-day unconfined compressive strength of
at least 100 pounds per square inch (psi).


7.1.3    Surface Drainage

Positive surface drainage should be provided around the buildings to direct surface water away
from the foundations. To reduce the potential for water ponding adjacent to the buildings, we
recommend the ground surface within a horizontal distance of five feet from the buildings slope
down away from the buildings with a surface gradient of at least two percent in unpaved areas
and one percent in paved areas. In addition, roof downspouts should be discharged into
controlled drainage facilities to keep the water away from the foundations.
Bioretention/treatment areas within five feet of the buildings should be lined with an
impermeable membrane at least 10 mils thick, such as Stegowrap, and provided with a subdrain.


7.2      Spread Footings

We conclude the proposed buildings may be supported on continuous or individual spread
footings bottomed on properly compacted fill. Continuous footings should be at least 12 inches
wide and isolated spread footings should be at least 18 inches wide. Footings should extend at



13-590                                            16                                      April 4, 2014
least 18 inches below the lowest adjacent exterior finished grade and at least 12 inches below the
lowest adjacent interior soil subgrade, whichever is lower. Footings should also be founded
below an imaginary line extending up at an inclination of 2:1 from bioretention/treatment areas.

The footings may be designed using allowable bearing pressures of 3,000 pounds per square foot
(psf) for dead-plus-live loads and 4,000 psf for total design loads, which include wind or seismic
forces. The allowable bearing pressures include factors of safety of at least 2.0 and 1.5, for static
and transient loading conditions, respectively.

Lateral loads may be resisted by a combination of passive pressure on the vertical faces of the
footings and friction between the bottoms of the footings and the supporting soil. To compute
passive resistance, we recommend using an equivalent fluid weight of 300 pounds per cubic foot
(pcf). The upper foot of soil should be ignored unless confined by a slab or pavement. Frictional
resistance should be computed using a base friction coefficient of 0.35. These values may be
used in combination without reduction. The passive pressure and frictional resistance values
include a factor of safety of at least 1.5.

Footing excavations should be free of standing water, debris, and disturbed materials prior to
placing concrete. The bottoms and sides of the footing excavations should be moistened
following excavation and maintained in a moist condition until concrete is placed. We should
check footing excavations prior to placement of reinforcing steel.


7.3      Concrete Slab-on-Grade Floor

Where water vapor transmission through the floor slab is undesirable, we recommend installing a
capillary moisture break and a water vapor retarder beneath the slab. A capillary moisture break
consists of at least four inches of clean, free-draining gravel or crushed rock. The vapor retarder
should meet the requirements for Class B vapor retarders stated in ASTM E1745. The vapor
retarder should be placed in accordance with the requirements of ASTM E1643. These
requirements include overlapping seams by six inches, taping seams, and sealing penetrations in
the vapor retarder. If required by the structural engineer, the vapor retarder may be covered with


13-590                                            17                                     April 4, 2014
two inches of sand to aid in curing the concrete and to protect the vapor retarder during slab
construction. The sand overlying the vapor retarder should be moist at the time concrete is
placed. However, excess water trapped in the sand could eventually be transmitted as vapor
through the slab. Therefore, if rain is forecast prior to pouring the slab, the sand should be
covered with plastic sheeting to avoid wetting. If the sand becomes wet, concrete should not be
placed until the sand has been dried or replaced.

The particle size of the capillary break material and sand (if used) should meet the gradation
requirements presented in Table 2 below.

                              No. 200                      0–5



Concrete mixes with high water/cement (w/c) ratios result in excess water in the concrete, which
increases the cure time and results in excessive vapor transmission through the slab. Therefore,
concrete for the floor slab should have a low w/c ratio - less than 0.50. If necessary, workability
should be increased by adding plasticizers. In addition, the slab should be properly cured.
Before floor coverings, if any, are placed, the contractor should check that the concrete surface
and the moisture emission levels (if emission testing is required) meet the manufacturer’s
requirements.

7.4      Pavement Design

7.4.1    Flexible (Asphalt Concrete) Pavement Design

The State of California flexible pavement design method was used to develop the recommended
asphalt concrete pavement sections. For AC pavement design, we used an R-value of 19.
Recommended pavement sections for traffic indices ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 are presented in
Table 3.

                  4.5                        2.5                         7.0

                  5.5                        3.0                         9.0


The upper six inches of the subgrade should be moisture-conditioned and compacted in
accordance with requirements presented in Section 7.1. The aggregate base should be moisture
conditioned to near optimum and compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction.

To prevent irrigation water from entering the pavement section, curbs adjacent to landscaped
areas should extend through the aggregate base and at least three inches into the underlying soil
subgrade.


7.4.2    Rigid (Portland Cement Concrete) Pavement

Concrete pavement design is based on a maximum single-axle load of 20,000 pounds and a
maximum tandem axle load of 32,000 pounds and light truck traffic (i.e., a few trucks per week).
The recommended rigid pavement section for these axle loads is six inches of Portland cement
concrete over six inches of Class 2 aggregate base.




13-590                                          19                                     April 4, 2014
The modulus of rupture of the concrete should be at least 500 psi at 28 days. Contraction joints
should be constructed at 15-foot spacing. Where the outer edge of a concrete pavement meets
asphalt concrete pavement, the concrete slab should be thickened by 50 percent at a taper not to
exceed a slope of 1 in 10. For areas that will receive weekly garbage truck traffic, we
recommend the slab be reinforced with a minimum of No. 4 bars at 16-inch spacing in both
directions. Recommendations for subgrade preparation and aggregate base compaction for
concrete pavement are the same as those we have described above for asphalt concrete
pavement.


7.4.3    Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavers

We recommend permeable interlocking concrete pavements (ICP) be designed in accordance
with the guidelines presented by the Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute (ICPI 2005).
These guidelines include specific recommendations for permeable aggregate subbase, base, and
bedding courses to be placed beneath ICP pavements. Based on the infiltration tests and soil
gradation, we estimate the recompacted on-site soil will have an infiltration rate ranging from
less than 0.1 inches per hour up to about 2 inches per hour where silty sand is exposed at
pavement subgrade elevation. Therefore, we recommend permeable pavers be designed for
partial exfiltration of water into the subgrade soil. This requires installing a subdrain system at
the base of the pervious aggregate materials, which are underlain by an filter fabric. ICPI’s
generalized paver section partial exfiltration is presented on Figure 6. If the permeable pavers
will be subjected to vehicular traffic, we recommend the geotextile shown on Figure 6 be
replaced with a Tensar TriAx TX7 geogrid to mitigate the potential for rutting of the subgrade.

The soil subgrade beneath ICP pavements should be prepared and compacted in accordance with
the recommendations presented in Section 7.1. In addition, the subgrade should be a firm and
non-yielding surface. The subgrade should be proof-rolled under the observation of our field
engineer to confirm it is non-yielding prior to placing the filter fabric and aggregate base
materials. The soil subgrade at the bottom of the permeable section should slope down toward
the drain pipe trench at a gradient of at least two percent. The perforated pipe should slope down


13-590                                           20                                       April 4, 2014
to a suitable outlet at a minimum gradient of one percent. The pipe should be placed with the
perforations down on a minimum of two inches of permeable subbase.

ICPI’s guidelines call for 1-1/2 to 2 inches of bedding material consisting of ASTM No. 8
aggregate directly below the pavers. This material is also recommended for fill material between
the pavers. As shown in Table 4 below, this material consists of fine gravel with 10 to 30
percent sand.

The ASTM No. 8 bedding should be underlain by a permeable base course of ASTM No. 57
crushed aggregate. As shown in Table 5, ASTM No. 57 aggregate consists of open-graded
gravel with a gradation between that of the 3/4-inch drain rock and the ASTM No. 8 aggregate.

The ASTM No. 57 permeable base course should be underlain by a permeable subbase course of
ASTM No. 2 crushed aggregate. The gradation requirements for ASTM No. 2 crushed aggregate
subbase are presented in Table 6.

                              2 inch                      35-70
                            1-1/2 inch                     0-15
                             3/4 inch                      0 -5



The No. 2 aggregate subbase course should be placed in lifts not exceeding 6 inches in loose
thickness and compacted using a smooth-drum roller, operated in static (non-vibratory) mode.
The subsequent course of No. 57 aggregate may be placed in one lift and should be compacted
with a smooth-drum roller in vibratory mode with sufficient passes to create an unyielding
surface. Placement and compaction of the permeable aggregate base and subbase should be
performed under the observation of our field engineer. Following compaction of the No. 57
aggregate, the No. 8 bedding, not exceeding 2 inches in loose thickness, should be placed and
screeded to a level, undisturbed surface immediately prior to paver installation.

The required thicknesses of the permeable aggregate base and subbase courses depends on the
infiltration and water storage design requirements, as well as the traffic loading demand. Our
recommendations for the minimum permeable ICP pavement section for pedestrian traffic are
presented in Table 7.

The above recommended ICP pavement section is based on the ICPI technical guidelines (ICPI
2005). From a geotechnical standpoint, it is acceptable to design the pedestrian ICP section to
exclude the No. 2 subbase course, in which case the No. 57 base course should be increased to
10 inches. From a geotechnical standpoint, it is also acceptable to use compacted structural
planting mix in lieu of the No. 57 and No. 2 base courses in locations where the pedestrian ICP
section is adjacent to tree wells and is required for promoting root growth. If either of these
approaches are used, the perforated pipe should include a filter fabric sleeve to prevent the finer
aggregate or organic material from entering the perforations.


7.5       Seismic Design

We understand the proposed buildings will be designed using the 2013 CBC. For design in
accordance with the 2013 CBC, we recommend Site Class D be used. The latitude and longitude
of the site are 37.68432 and -122.11197, respectively. Hence, in accordance with the 2013 CBC,
we recommend the following:

         SS = 2.306g, S1 = 0.957g
         SMS = 2.306g, SM1 = 1.436g
         SDS = 1.537g, SD1 = 0.957g
         PGAM = 0.886g
         Seismic Design Category D for Risk Categories I, II and III.

8.0      ADDITIONAL GEOTECHNICAL SERVICES

Prior to construction, Rockridge Geotechnical should review the project plans and specifications
to verify that they conform to the intent of our recommendations. During construction, our field
engineer should provide on-site observation and testing during site preparation, placement and
compaction of fill, and installation of building foundations. These observations will allow us to
compare actual with anticipated subsurface conditions and to verify that the contractor's work
conforms to the geotechnical aspects of the plans and specifications.

9.0      LIMITATIONS

This geotechnical study has been conducted in accordance with the standard of care commonly
used as state-of-practice in the profession. No other warranties are either expressed or implied.
The recommendations made in this report are based on the assumption that the subsurface
conditions do not deviate appreciably from those disclosed in the exploratory borings and CPTs.
If any variations or undesirable conditions are encountered during construction, we should be
notified so that additional recommendations can be made. The foundation recommendations
presented in this report are developed exclusively for the proposed development described in this
report and are not valid for other locations and construction in the project vicinity.

  Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI) calculation procedure

  Calculation of the Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI) is used to interpret the liquefaction assessment calculations in terms of
  severity over depth. The calculation procedure is based on the methology developed by Iwasaki (1982) and is adopted by AFPS.

  To estimate the severity of liquefaction extent at a given site, LPI is calculated based on the following equation:




                                                           LPI =


  where:
  FL = 1 - F.S. when F.S. less than 1
  FL = 0 when F.S. greater than 1
  z depth of measurment in meters

  Values of LPI range between zero (0) when no test point is characterized as liquefiable and 100 when all points are characterized
  as susceptible to liquefaction. Iwasaki proposed four (4) discrete categories based on the numeric value of LPI:

  LPI = 0          :   Liquefaction   risk   is   very low
  0 < LPI <= 5     :   Liquefaction   risk   is   low
  5 < LPI <= 15    :   Liquefaction   risk   is   high
  LPI > 15         :   Liquefaction   risk   is   very high

RE:    Phase II Environmental Site Assessment
       17482 Boston Road and 278 Hampton Road
       Hayward, California

Dear Mr. Freitag:

Vista Environmental Consulting, Inc. (Vista) has prepared this report to document the geophysical survey
and soil sampling conducted at 17482 Boston Road and 278 Hampton Road located in Hayward,
California (the Site, Figures 1 & 2). The following sections present the objective of the work, a
description of field activities and a summary of the analytical results.

Objective

The objective of this project was to perform a Phase II subsurface investigation at the Site. The work
described herein was performed on behalf of the County of Alameda General Services Agency (GSA)
and in response to recommended additional investigation activities, as stated in the Vista Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I ESA) completed in September, 2013.

Field Preparation

Vista performed field reconnaissance and marked boring locations in white paint for Underground
Service Alert (USA), a regional sub-surface utility notification service. Figure 2 depicts the boring
locations. A boring permit from Alameda County Public Works Agency was not needed for the shallow
soil sampling.

Field Work

Based on the Site use history and Vista’s observations, the Phase I ESA recommended the collection of
soil samples. In addition to soil sampling, GSA requested the performance of a geophysical survey.
Presented below are descriptions of each of these two field activities.

Geophysical Survey
A geophysical survey was performed at the Site on October 21, 2013, by JR Associates, an engineering
geophysics firm located in San Jose, California. The purpose of the survey was to identify subsurface

anomalies that could be indicative of buried metal objects such as tanks, pipes, etc. A complete copy of
the geophysical survey report is included as Attachment 1. A discussion of the results is presented
below.

Soil Sample Collection
A total of (24) discrete soil samples from (12) soil borings (Figure 2) and (14) 3-point composite soil
samples (Figure 3) were collected at the Site on October 10 and 16, 2013. A summary of sample
collection performed at the Site is as follows:

       1.      (8) discrete soil borings located at the Hampton Road property (B-1 through B-8). These
               borings were advanced using a hand auger to a total depth of 24 inches below ground
               surface (bgs) with the first sample collected from the ground surface to 12 inches bgs and
               the second sample collected from 12 inches to 24 inches bgs.
       2.      (10) 3-point composite surface soil samples (278-131010-HA02-01 through 278-131010-
               HA02-10) located at the Hampton Road property. The 3-point composite samples were
               collected by placing (3) approximately equal sized soil aliquots from within each
               composite sampling location.
       3.      (4) discrete soil borings located at the Boston Road property (B-9 through B-12). These
               borings were advanced using a hand auger to a total depth of 24 inches bgs with the first
               sample collected from the ground surface to 12 inches bgs and the second sample
               collected from 12 inches to 24 inches bgs.
       4.      (4) 3-point composite surface soil samples (17482-101613-HA01-01 through 17482-
               101613-HA01-04) located at the Boston Road property. The 3-point composite samples
               were collected by placing (3) approximately equal sized soil aliquots from within each
               composite sampling location.

Vista advanced the soil borings using a hand auger and collected the soil samples as the soil cuttings
were retrieved at the surface. The generated soil cuttings were continuously observed such that soil type
could be assessed. Recovered soil cuttings were described in general accordance with ASTM standard
D-2488-09a and soil type and observations were recorded in the field notes. Soil samples were collected
by carefully placing the generated soil cuttings into a clean stainless steel bowl, homogenizing the
sample interval and transferring the sample into clean laboratory provided glass jars. Once in the jar, the
sample was placed in ice filled chests for transport to TestAmerica, Inc. located in Pleasanton, California,
a state of California certified analytical laboratory, under chain-of-custody protocol. Sampling staff used
new nitrile gloves before commencing soil boring activities at each sampling location and a second set of
new nitrile gloves was used prior to actual soil sample collection.

Prior to commencing soil boring activities at the first boring location and between each soil boring
location the sampling tools were cleaned by washing tools that came in contact with the soil (hand auger,
stainless steel bowl) in an alconox-water solution, washing with a scrub brush, then rinsing in a bucket
of clean water.

Vista collected the 3-point composite surface soil samples by first defining each composite sampling
zone then collecting the three approximately equal sized aliquots from within each of these zones.
Surface soil samples were collected by gently scooping soil by hand and into the sample container.
Sampling staff used new nitrile gloves before commencing soil sampling activities at each composite soil
sampling zone. Once in the sample container, the sample was placed in ice filled chests for transport to
Forensic Analytical Laboratory located in Hayward, California, a state of California certified analytical
laboratory, under chain-of-custody protocol.

Observed soil type consisted primarily of brown silt (ML) with varying degrees of sand, gravel and
building debris, depending on the particular sampling location. At the Hampton Road property the
following observations were made: Building debris (e.g., stucco, wood, glass, metal) was noted in
borings B-2, B-3 and B-4. Borings B-1 and B-7 were observed to contain primarily silt with varying
degrees of sand and gravel. Borings B-5, B-6 and B-8 were observed to be comprised of silt. At the
Boston Road property borings B-9 through B-12 were observed to be comprised of silt with no sand,
gravel nor building debris noted. Copies of the field notes are included as Attachment 1.

Analytical Program

For the 8 discrete soil borings located at 278 Hampton Road, the soil samples collected from 0-1.0 feet
bgs were initially analyzed by the following analytical procedures:

       1.      Asbestos by Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) utilizing dispersion staining techniques in
               accordance with the EPA’s “Method for the Determination of Asbestos in Bulk Building
               Materials” U.S. EPA/600/R-93/116, Visual Area Estimate, dated July 1993 and adopted
               by the NVLAP as Test Method Code 18/A01; and
       2.      Lead by USEPA 3050B/7420.

Discrete soil samples collected from 12 to 24 inches bgs were placed on hold pending the results of the
discrete soil samples collected from 0 to 12 inches bgs.

Based on the initial analytical results, some of the deeper discrete soil samples were analyzed:

       1.      Sample B-2-2.0: lead, cadmium and arsenic by USEPA Method 6010 (ICP) and
               organochlorine pesticides by USEPA Method 8081A;

Upon conclusion of soil boring and sample collection activities at each discrete soil boring location the
boring was backfilled with generated soil core to the ground surface and nominally compacted.

Geophysical Survey Results

According to the JR Associates report, the results of the geophysical survey indicated several subsurface
anomalies at the Site. Most of the anomalies could be explained by existing cyclone fencing, existing

concrete slabs and existing structures. Other anomalies could be attributed to buried metal piping, which
appears to be associated with water pipes from an irrigation system at the Hampton Road property. One
anomaly centered in the Hampton Road property appeared to consist of four smaller anomalies all
located adjacent to each other. The location of these 4 small anomalies is depicted on Figure 2 of the JR
Associates report (Attachment 1).

At the Boston Road property, lead ranged in concentration from 70 mg/kg to 1800 mg/kg.

Discussion

For review and discussion purposes, soil sample analytical results were compared to regulatory agency
criteria. The following criteria were used:

In order to better understand the detections of metals, the following two sources were referenced to
determine if the detected concentrations of metals fell within the expected range of detections associated
with naturally occurring metals in the environment:

Asbestos
As stated in the Analytical Results section, asbestos was not detected in any of the soil samples analyzed
(discrete soil borings B-1-1.0 through B-8-1.0 and composite soil samples 278-131010-HA02-01 through

Pesticides
The detected concentrations of pesticides 4,4’-DDT, 4,4’-DDE and 4,4’-DDD were below the regulatory
criteria referenced in this report.

Chlordane (technical or “total”) was detected above the residential ESL and the residential CHHSL in
two samples (B-10-1.0 and B-10-2.0) and above the commercial/industrial ESL and
commercial/industrial CHHSL in one sample (B-10-1.0).

There are numerous derivations of chlordane that can be found, of which alpha- and gamma-chlordane
are reportedly the most persistent in the environment. Regulatory criteria used for chlordane is based on
an additive compilation of these different derivations. According to the analytical laboratory, adding the
concentrations of alpha and gamma-chlordane to arrive at a total chlordane level is an acceptable
methodology and will thus provide a meaningful comparison to regulatory criteria as the ESLs and
CHHSLs do not present alpha nor gamma-chlordane levels, just (technical or “total”) chlordane.

Gamma-BHC (Lindane) was detected above the residential and commercial/industrial ESL in one sample
(B-8-1.0). It should be noted that for sample B-7-2.0, the analytical laboratory used a dilution factor of
10 due to the elevated concentrations of Dieldrin, DDT and DDD. This resulted in a detection limit of 19
ug/kg for gamma-BHC, which is above the residential and commercial/industrial ESL of 9.8 ug/kg. It
should also be noted that gamma-BHC was not detected in the shallower soil sample from boring B-7 (B-
7-1.0) based on a detection limit of 2.0 ug/kg.

Endosulfan sulfate was detected above the residential and commercial/industrial ESL in three samples
(B-7-1.0, B-7-2.0 and B-8-1.0). It should be noted that for sample B-12-1.0, the analytical laboratory
used a dilution factor of 5 due to the elevated concentrations of Dieldrin and DDT. This resulted in a
detection limit of 9.8 ug/kg for endosulfan sulfate, which is above the residential and
commercial/industrial ESL of 4.6 ug/kg.

Dieldrin was detected above the residential and commercial/industrial ESL in twelve samples, above the
residential CHHSL in six samples and above the commercial/industrial CHHSL in five samples.

It should be noted that the residential and commercial/industrial ESLs for dieldrin that are presented on
Table 1 are based on a “groundwater protection” basis and not on a “human health protection” basis. We
chose to use the groundwater protection basis as it is the lowest number and therefore the most
conservative. For reference, the residential ESL for protection of human health is 34 ug/kg and the
commercial/industrial ESL for protection of human health is 67 ug/kg.

In the case of toxaphene, the laboratory supplied method detection limit ranges from a low of 39 ug/kg
(with a dilution factor of 1) to a high of 200 ug/kg (dilution factor of 5). The ESL User’s Guide (first
published in November 2007, updated in May 2008 and currently undergoing a second update in 2013)
directs the user to substitute the laboratory method detection limit in place of the posted ESL (ESL
User’s Guide, Section 2.8, Substitution of Laboratory Reporting Limits and Ambient Background
Concentrations for ESLs). The User’s Guide states that, “…it is generally acceptable to consider the

method reporting limit in place of the screening level.” This process was confirmed with Uta Hellmann-
Blumberg, Staff Toxicologist of the RWQCB, Region 2 (San Francisco Bay Region) via telephone
conversation on December 2, 2013.

As noted on the analytical laboratory report from TestAmerica, a few of the subsequently requested
pesticide analyses were conducted outside of the 14 day holding time. While this is not ideal from a data
defensibility standpoint, the fact that pesticides are well known to be persistent in the environment leads
to the conclusion that the concentration of any pesticides contained in the samples will most likely not
degrade or decrease over the span of several days beyond the 14 day holding time. An additional point
is to note that the samples were stored in a refrigerator at the laboratory thereby further reducing the
possibility of sample concentration degradation.

Metals
Of the 10 metals analyzed, 3 were not detected above laboratory detection levels (hexavalent chromium,
silver and selenium). Of the 7 that were detected, 3 were above (lead, arsenic and barium) and 4 were
below (cadmium, nickel, total chromium, and mercury) the regulatory criteria referenced in this report.

For lead sample results (including all discrete and composite samples), the levels ranged from 10 mg/kg
to a maximum of 1800 mg/kg. The regulatory criteria range from a low of 80 mg/kg (residential ESL
and CHHSL) to a high of 320 mg/kg (commercial/industrial ESL and CHHSL). Of the 34 samples
analyzed, 25 were above either ESLs and/or CHHSLs. Of these exceedances, 9 were above both the
residential ESLs and the CHHSLs but below the commercial/industrial ESLs and CHHSLs and 16
samples were above the commercial/industrial ESLs and CHHSLs.

 For arsenic, the levels ranged from 4.4 mg/kg to a maximum of 47 mg/kg. The regulatory criteria range
from a low of 0.07 mg/kg (residential CHHSL) to a high of 0.96 mg/kg (commercial/industrial ESL).
Having arsenic exceed the regulatory criteria is common in the bay area due to naturally elevated arsenic
concentrations in the local bedrock and soil created by the degradation of bedrock. Except for the
samples collected at boring B-10 (47 mg/kg at 0-1.0 feet bgs and 45 mg/kg at 1.0-2.0 feet bgs) it appears
the levels detected in soil during this program appear similar to those detected in locations throughout the
bay area and also appear indicative of natural conditions. At boring B-10, it still may be that the detected
concentrations are from a naturally occurring source especially given that all other samples do not
indicate a widespread issue of elevated concentrations of arsenic.

For reference, the expected range of concentrations of naturally occurring arsenic, according to Shaklette,
is <0.10 to 97 mg/kg with an arithmetic mean concentration of 7.0 mg/kg. The LBNL study estimates
that the local (East Bay hills) upper estimate of background concentration is 24 mg/kg. Therefore, when
the generated analytical data is compared to the expected range and mean concentration of naturally
occurring arsenic one can reasonably conclude that the detected concentrations of arsenic at the Site are
most likely due to naturally occurring arsenic in local bedrock and/or soils.

For barium, the levels ranged from 110 to 930 mg/kg. The regulatory criteria range from a low of 750
mg/kg (residential ESL) to a high of 63,000 mg/kg (commercial/industrial CHHSL). A single sample (B-

Notes:
1. Only those detected compounds listed. A complete copy of the analytical laboratory report is included as Attachment 1.
2. There are numerous derivations of chlordane that can be found, of which alpha- and gamma-chlordane are reportedly the most persistent in the environment. Regulatory criteria used for chlordane is
based on an additive compilation of these different derivations. According to the analytical laboratory, adding the concentrations of alpha and gamma-chlordane to arrive at a total chlordane level is an
acceptable methodology and will thus provide a meaningful comparison to regulatory criteria as the ESLs and CHHSLs do not present alpha nor gamma-chlordane levels, just (technical or “total”)
chlordane.

  This report presents the results of a geophysical investigation performed at 17482 Boston Road
and 278 Hampton Road in Hayward, California. The investigation was performed for Vista
Environmental Consulting by J R Associates. The purpose of the investigation was to look for
geophysical indications of buried metal objects. James Rezowalli, Principal Geophysicist, and
Brian Rezowalli, Technician, of J R Associates performed the field work in October of 2013.


A. Site


  The site consists of two properties, one is off Hampton Road and the other is off Boston Road
in Hayward, California (Drawing 1). The property off Boston Road is a single family residence
and the property off Hampton is an empty lot. A single family residence once occupied the
empty lot. Remnants of concrete pads and hose bibs could still be seen on the Hampton Road
property. The purpose of our magnetic investigation was to look for geophysical indications of
buried metal objects. Encountering buried objects like old tanks, buried trash, and old wells can
hinder future redevelopment. Encountering unexpected buried objects can slow reconstruction
and add to its cost.




                                                                                                  1
                                          II METHODS


 We performed a magnetic investigation at the site. A magnetic investigation maps the earth’s
vertical magnetic gradient. The magnetic gradient is uniform throughout a site free of metal.
The magnetic gradient at a site that contains ferrous metal is not uniform. Metal objects produce
magnetic anomalies with characteristic shapes and magnitudes. For example, an anomaly caused
by a buried fuel storage tank is characterized by a strong magnetic low just south of the center of
the tank and a weaker magnetic high just north of the tank. This type of anomaly is what we use
to locate buried fuel storage tanks.


A. Magnetic Instrumentation


 We used a Geometrics model 856 proton precession magnetometer to collect magnetic data at
the site. The magnetometer had two sensors and an electronics package. The magnetometer
collected both total field data and vertical gradient data. The magnetometer can discriminate to
0.1 gammas in a total field of 40,000 to 60,000 gammas. Magnetic readings were stored in
memory with the time of day, station numbers, and line numbers of the readings. The data were
downloaded to a computer and contoured.


B. Magnetic Field Procedures


 The area where magnetic data were collected is shown on Drawing 2. Magnetic data were
collected at 10-foot intervals along lines spaced 10 feet apart in accessible areas of the site. At
the end of the field day the magnetic data were downloaded and contoured. An anomaly is
indicated by a series of concentric magnetic contours.



                                                                                                      2

                                           III RESULTS


A. Magnetic Anomalies


    Drawing 2 shows the contour map of the magnetic data collected at the property. There were
several magnetic anomalies at the site. Most of the anomalies were caused by the cyclone fences
surrounding the site. Some anomalies were caused by the house and shed on the Boston road
property. Other anomalies were caused by buried pipes. The pipes appeared to be water lines
and were probably part of an irrigation system on the Hampton Road property. We found one
area with four small anomalies that were from buried metal. The area was in the middle of the
Hampton Road property and is shown in red on Drawing 2. The anomalies were marked with
green pin flags in the field. Usually anomalies like these are caused by debris left over from the
demolition of buildings. Occasionally they are caused from buried trash pits or old heating oil
tanks. Typically the objects that cause anomalies like these are buried within three feet of the
ground surface. We recommend potholing the four anomalies to determine their cause.


B. Limitations


    Magnetic methods locate ferrous objects from the anomalies they produce in the earth's
magnetic field. It is possible some ferrous objects will not produce an anomaly. Some possible
reasons are that the object is buried too deep, the object is too small, the object is buried under or
near another metal object, or an object is buried near a utility. It is possible there are materials
buried at the site that were not detected by the magnetometer. We recommend rerunning the
magnetic survey after the surface metal has been removed.

Method 8081A: Surrogate recovery for the following sample was outside control limits: B-12-1.0 (720-53093-23). Evidence of matrix
interference is present; therefore, re-extraction and/or re-analysis was not performed.

Method 8081A: The % RPD between the primary and confirmation columns is >40% for sample B-11-1.0 (720-53093-21). Due to the
coelution of a non-target peak, the lower value has been reported instead of the higher value for the following compounds: Alpha-chlodane

Method 8081A: The % RPD between the primary and confirmation columns is >40% for sample B-12-1.0 (720-53093-23). Due to the
coelution of a non-target peak, the lower value has been reported instead of the higher value for the following compounds: DDD.

Method 8081A: The matrix spike / matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD) percent recoveries and %RPD for batch #146684 were outside control
limits. This is attributed to: non-homogeneity of the sample matrix; abundance of target analytes at concentrations significantly higher than
the spike concentration; matrix interferences; etc.>>

Inhomogeneous samples are separated into homogeneous subsamples and analyzed individually. ND means no fibers were detected. When
detected, the minimum detection and reporting limit is less than 1% unless point counting is performed. Floor tile samples may contain large
amounts of interference material and it is recommended that the sample be analyzed by gravimetric point count analysis to lower the detection
limit and to aid in asbestos identification.

Method 8081A: The following sample was prepared outside the method defined holding time because the request for the test was made
after the holding time for the sample expired: B-11-2.0 (720-53093-22), B-12-2.0 (720-53093-24), B-2-2.0 (720-53093-4), B-3-2.0                           12

Method 8081A: The % RPD between the primary and confirmation columns is >40% for sample B-7-2.0 (720-53093-14). Due to the
coelution of a non-target peak, the lower value has been reported instead of the higher value for the following compound: 4,4'-DDD.                       14
Method 8081A: The % RPD between the primary and confirmation columns is >40% for sample B-10-2.0 (720-53093-20). Due to the
coelution of a non-target peak, the lower value has been reported instead of the higher value for the following compounds:
Alpha-chlodane; gamma-chlodane.

Method 8081A: The following sample was diluted due to the abundance of non-target analytes: B-10-2.0 (720-53093-20), B-7-2.0
(720-53093-14). Elevated reporting limits (RLs) are provided.

Method 8081A: Surrogate recovery for the following sample was outside control limits: B-7-2.0 (720-53093-14). Evidence of matrix
interference is present; therefore, re-extraction and/or re-analysis was not performed.

1.0       INTRODUCTION


1.1       Purpose and Objective


The purpose of this survey was to identify hazardous building materials that will be
impacted by upcoming demolition activities for the Cherryland Community Center Project
located at 17482 Boston Road and 278 Hampton Road, Hayward, CA. The data provided in
this report can assist all parties involved in this project to make informed decisions with
regard to regulatory compliance and the health and safety of their employees. This survey
included the following:
         Visible and accessible suspect asbestos-containing construction materials (ACCM)
          were assessed and sampled to determine asbestos content.
         Representative painted and coated building components were assessed and sampled
          for lead content.
         Visible and accessible materials commonly found in buildings which potentially have
          hazardous properties that are regulated were assessed, but not sampled. These
          materials include, but are not limited to:
                Universal Waste (UW) materials, such as non-incandescent lamps, batteries,
                 and mercury-containing devices;
                Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) containing devices such as lamp ballasts;
                Low-level radioactive sourced devices such as smoke detector;


1.2       Team Members/Survey Dates
VEC performed the hazardous materials survey on August 24, 2013. The asbestos survey was
performed by Christopher Burns a State of California Division of Occupational Safety and

No asbestos was detected in the 4 samples collected and analyzed. Mounded soil and
apparent demolition debris surround the concrete foundations at the central portion of the
site and may occur throughout the site. These materials may contain asbestos and should be
sampled prior to disturbance.


Historically utility companies in the Bay Area used asbestos-containing cement piping for
water supply. This type of subsurface piping may be present throughout the Project Site.


2.2     Non-Asbestos Homogeneous Areas

3.0      SURVEY PROTOCOLS


3.1      Field/Analytical Protocol


3.1.1 Asbestos
The asbestos survey was performed generally in accordance with the AHERA protocol (40
CFR Part 763, Subpart E). Visual identification was performed by assessing visible and
accessible structural, architectural, and mechanical components for the presence of suspect
ACCM at the Project Site. Destructive sampling techniques were employed where
appropriate.


This limited ACCM survey was conducted in the following manner:
       Suspect ACCM was categorized into homogeneous materials. A homogeneous material
         is defined as a surfacing material, thermal system insulation, or miscellaneous
         material which is uniform in color and texture. It may also be additionally
         subcategorized using the date of installation, when available.
       A sampling scheme was developed based upon the location and quantity of the
         suspect homogeneous ACCM. A rough order of magnitude estimate of each suspect
         homogenous ACCM was calculated and recorded for future reference. A sampling
         scheme, including a specific number of samples per suspect homogeneous ACCM, was
         calculated prior to sampling.
       Sampling guidelines established by the United States Environmental Protection
         Agency (USEPA) were utilized for sampling each suspected homogeneous ACCM.
         Methods described in Appendix K of 8 California Code of Regulation (CCR) 1529 were
         utilized in the collection of each suspect homogeneous ACCM sample.
       Trained California asbestos certified personnel, using appropriate sampling tools and
         sterile leak-tight Whirl-pak® containers, collected building materials that were
         suspected to contain ACCM.
       Each suspect ACCM sample was collected and sealed in its container and
         appropriately labeled with a unique sample identification number and recorded on an
         asbestos bulk sampling log. Each log contains a chain-of-custody to assure the proper
         transition of the samples from VEC to the analytical laboratory.
       Sampling tools were decontaminated between the collection of each suspect sample to
         prevent the possibility of cross contamination to subsequent suspect ACCM samples.

Hazardous Materials Survey Report                                   Project No. 1306225

The suspect ACCM samples were delivered, under proper chain-of-custody protocol, to
Forensic Analytical Laboratories (FAL) in Hayward, California. FAL is accredited under the
National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and the California
Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (Cal-ELAP). The samples were submitted
for analysis by Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) utilizing dispersion staining techniques in
accordance with the EPA’s “Method for the Determination of Asbestos in Bulk Building
Materials” U.S. EPA/600/R-93/116, Visual Area Estimate, dated July 1993 and adopted by
the NVLAP as Test Method Code 18/A01.


3.1.2 Lead Paint
This survey included a limited screening of paint and ceramic tile finishes for the purpose of
characterizing the lead content in paint and coatings likely to be disturbed during demolition
activities. Trained California lead certified personnel, using appropriate sampling tools and
sterile leak-tight Whirl-pak® containers, collected painted finishes and ceramic tiles that
were suspected to contain lead. Each sample container was labeled with unique sample
identification. Sampling tools were decontaminated between the collection of each suspect
sample to prevent the possibility of cross contamination.


The paint chip and ceramic tile samples were delivered, under proper chain-of-custody
protocol, to FAL in Hayward, California. FAL is accredited under American Industrial
Hygiene Association (AIHA), the Environmental Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program
(ELLAP), and the California Department of Public Health Services (CDPH) for multiple
metals analysis. The samples were prepared and analyzed by method EPA 3050B/7420,
Flame Atomic Absorption.


3.1.3 Other Hazardous Materials
Devices with other potential hazardous materials were visually identified during the survey
walk through and their quantities were estimated and recorded. No attempt was made to
disassemble devices or sample suspect materials within the devices.


3.2    Limitations
VEC’s intent was to perform a thorough survey based on industry standards and make a
good faith effort to access all building materials down to the structural components and/or
interstitial spaces. Sub-surface areas were not included as part of this survey, hence no

excavation was conducted to discover buried insulated piping and/or asbestos cement utility
piping concealed below the surface. Materials encountered in the buildings/site that are not
part of this report must be properly sampled for the content of asbestos or assumed to be
asbestos containing prior to any disturbance.


The lead survey was to screen for lead levels and provide results which are generally
representative of typical conditions but are not inclusive of all painted/coated surfaces
present at this site or the impacted areas. This survey was not a surface by surface inspection
as outlined in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Guidelines
For the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing pursuant to Title X
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. The analytical data can be
helpful in evaluation of lead-related environmental risks in general. However, the data
cannot be used to calculate worker exposures and is not a substitute for employee exposure
monitoring or waste stream sampling.


VEC’s limited visual survey indicated that light fixtures with ballasts that may contain PCB
oil are present. VEC recommends that all ballasts be visually inspected, prior to disposal, to
determine if they contain PCB’s. Those ballasts marked No PCB’s or PCB Free can be
considered as such as should be treated as UW - electronic waste. All PCB-containing
devices, including, but not limited to ballasts, should be removed or have the oils removed
and properly handled, collected, stored, transported and recycled or disposed of by an
approved recycling or disposal facility in accordance with the requirements of Title 22 CCR
67426.1.


Findings, conclusions, recommendations and analytical data offered in this report have been
derived from reviewing existing information provided by the client, visual assessment of the
building materials and systems, and the outcome of sampling and analysis of suspect ACM
and suspect lead containing materials.


Quantities and locations are based upon areas that were accessed. Materials similar to those
in this report may be present in areas which were not accessed. Because of this, VEC
recommends including line item pricing, allowances, and/or additive/deductive wording to
bid sheets for unforeseen conditions.

Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the Cherryland Community Center.
The purpose of the traffic study was to identify any traffic-related impacts that would result from the proposed
community center. The project is located at 278 Hampton Road in the community of Cherryland in unincorporated
Alameda County. The proposed community center involves construction of a new building and demolition of
single family residence. The proposed project would generate less than 100 peak hour trips and because of this
an analysis of Congestion Management Program (CMP) facilities is not required. According to the proposed site
plan, the project would have a single driveway on Hampton Road.

Project Trip Estimates and Traffic Volumes
Project trips were added to the baseline traffic volumes to represent baseline (background) traffic conditions with
implementation of the project. The cumulative traffic conditions associated with year 2035 were analyzed both
without and with the project using the Alameda County Transportation Model. This model is maintained by the
Alameda County Transportation Commission.

Project Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis are summarized in Table ES-1. The results show that the
two signalized study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service under baseline (background)
project conditions.
The results show that the following signalized study intersection would operate at unacceptable levels of service
under Cumulative and Cumulative Project conditions:
       Mission Boulevard and Hampton Road
Mission Boulevard and Hampton Road. The average delay at the intersection of Mission Boulevard and Hampton
Road under the cumulative project conditions is not forecasted to increase compared to the average delay under
cumulative conditions, therefore this result does not constitute a significant impact.

Site Access and Site Circulation
According to the proposed site plan, the Cherryland Community Center would have vehicular access at a single
driveway on Hampton Road. Overall, the site plan exhibits good on-site circulation for vehicles. Based on the site
plan, the parking would be 90-degree head-in parking.
The one driveway on Hampton Road would have a throat length of approximately 20 feet. Although limited in
terms of accommodating stacked cars leaving the lot, the traffic volumes on Hampton Road are relatively low.
According to the site plan, the 19-space parking lot located adjacent to the building has a dead-end aisle. This
means that vehicles need to turn around within the aisle if they have not located a vacant space, in order to exit
the parking lot. If turnover on the site is not high, this is generally not an issue

On-Site Parking
The estimated parking supply of 80 spaces falls slightly short of the estimated 86 spaces necessary. Since there
is on-street parking outside the two-block perimeter that was included in the supply estimates, the likely outcome
is that some visitors of the community center may need to park 2 blocks away or more. Although there is no
empirical research on the sharing of parking opportunities for the two uses (Meek Park and the proposed
community center), it is possible that some users of the community center will overlap with those visiting the park.
This aspect of shared parking was not assumed in the estimates, so the 86 parking spaces for the community
center are potentially a conservative estimate. Also the Hayward Area Recreation District, which will coordinate
activities at the proposed community center, anticipates coordinating activities between the park uses and the
community center such that major activities do not overlap. This aspect will significantly improve the chances of
providing sufficient available parking for the community center.

Other Transportation Issues
The proposed community center would not have a significant adverse effect on existing transit, pedestrian, or
bicycle facilities in the study area.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Cherryland Community
Center. The purpose of the traffic study was to identify any traffic-related impacts that would result from the
proposed project. The project is located at 278 Hampton Road near the intersection of Boston Road. The project
is located in the community of Cherryland in unincorporated Alameda County. The project involves construction of
a new building and demolition of a residence.
According to the proposed site plan, the project would have one driveway on Hampton Road. The project site and
the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. The proposed site plan is show on Figure 2.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the project. The
impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies consistent with Alameda County
and the City of Hayward. The following study intersections were analyzed for potential impacts:

Study Intersections
        Meekland Avenue and Hampton Road
        Mission Boulevard and Hampton Road
In summary, the study includes an analysis of 2 signalized intersections in the vicinity of the project site. Traffic
conditions at the intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The AM peak
hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00
PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on an average day.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
   Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from recent traffic counts.

   Scenario 2: Near Term No Project Conditions. Near term traffic volumes without implementation of the
               project were estimated by applying an annual growth rate of 1 percent to existing traffic
               volumes. According to Alameda County staff, there are no approved or pending projects in the
               study area. Thus, applying an annual growth rate of 1 percent would be acceptable for the

    Scenario 3:   Near Term Project Conditions. New peak hour trips generated by the project were estimated
                  based on, The ITE Trip Generation Manual, Ninth Edition. The resulting project trips were
                  added to Near Term No Project traffic volumes to represent future near term traffic conditions
                  with implementation of the project (hereafter called near term project traffic volumes). The near
                  term project traffic volumes were then assigned to the surrounding roadway network.

    Scenario 4:   2035 Cumulative Conditions. Additional trips generated by potential future developments in the
                  project area beyond near term were estimated by using the Alameda County Transportation
                  Model, maintained by the Alameda County Transportation Commission. The resulting 2035
                  cumulative project traffic volumes for the roadways were manipulated to yield 2035 cumulative
                  project traffic volumes for the study intersections.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described above. It
includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable level of service
standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, field observations, Alameda County and
the Hayward Area Recreation District. The following data were collected from these sources:

   Existing traffic volumes
   Lane configurations
   Bus route data

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no delay, to
LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are described below.

Signalized Intersections
All of the signalized study intersections are located in unincorporated Alameda County and are therefore subject
to the Alameda County level of service standards. For this analysis, it was assumed that the Alameda County
level of service standard are consistent with those of the City of Hayward. The City of Hayward level of service
standard for signalized intersections is LOS D or better. The level of service methodology used for this study is
TRAFFIX, based on the 1994 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) operations method for signalized intersections.
The 1994 HCM method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average stopped delay time
for all vehicles at the intersection. Thus, the average delay and corresponding level of service reported for each
signalized intersection analyzed for this traffic study are based on the average stopped delay at the intersection.
The correlation between average stopped delay and level of service is shown in Table 1.

Report Organization
The remainder of this report is divided into four chapters. Chapter 2 describes existing conditions in terms of the
existing roadway network, transit service, and existing bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Chapter 3 presents the
intersection operations under baseline conditions without implementation of the project. Chapter 4 describes the
method used to estimate project traffic and project-related impacts on the transportation system. Chapter 5
presents the conclusions of the transportation analysis.

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of the site,
including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via I-580 and I-238. Local access to the site is provided by
Hampton Road and Meekland Avenue. These facilities are described below.
Interstate 238 (I-238) is an east/west freeway providing regional access between I-880 and I-580. I-238 is a six-
lane freeway. Full interchanges are provided at I-880 and at I-580.
Hampton Road/Mattox Road is a two-lane undivided east-west minor arterial and provides direct access to the
project site. There are no bike lanes on Hampton Road. Access to the project is provided via a single driveway on
Hampton Road. On the east side of Mission Boulevard the street name changes to Mattox Road.
Mission Boulevard/East 14th Street is a north-south divided major arterial with two lanes in each direction. North
of Hampton Road, the street name changes to East 14th Street, and extends northward into San Leandro. There
are no bike lanes on Mission Boulevard in the vicinity of the project.
Meekland Avenue is a north-south undivided minor arterial with one lane of travel in each direction. Depot Road
begins at Cabot Boulevard in an industrial area of Hayward, and extends eastward where it transitions into Cathy
Way at its intersection with Hesperian Boulevard. Crosswalks are provided at one Community center driveway on
Depot Road and at Hesperian Boulevard. There are no bike lanes on Depot Road. Access to Community center is
provided via four driveways on Depot Road.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
According to the Alameda County Bicycle Master Plan, there are limited existing bicycle facilities in the immediate
project vicinity. There are existing bike lanes on Meekland Avenue. Class I bike lanes are proposed for Western
Boulevard, which runs parallel to Mission Boulevard and is approximately two blocks east of the project. A class I
bike facility is a multi-use path.
The proposed class I bike facility would greatly improve the connectivity of the currently limited network of bicycle
facilities.
Pedestrian facilities in the study area consist primarily of a continuous network of sidewalks along the previously
described local roadways. Crosswalks with pedestrian push buttons and signal heads are provided at the major

                                                                                                             Page | 6

intersections in the project area. Existing pedestrian traffic in the project area primarily is generated by visitors of
Meek Park and local residents walking to and from the park, bus stops, and nearby schools on Meekland Avenue.

Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (ACTransit). The
project is served by local bus lines 32, 93 and 99. The line 32 bus stops on Meekland Avenue near the
intersection of Hampton Road. Line 32 provides service between BART Bayfair station and downtown Hayward
and has 60-minute headways on weekends. On Mission Boulevard, ACTransit operates lines 93 and 99. Line 93
with headways of 60 minutes on weekends, provides service between the BART Bayfair station and Meekland
Avenue. Line 99 provides service between BART Bayfair station and BART Fremont station, and operates with 30
minute weekend headways.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were collected in the field. The existing intersection
lane configurations are shown on Figure 4.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing AM and PM peak-hour traffic volumes were obtained from new manual turning-movement counts at the
study intersections. The existing peak-hour intersection volumes are shown on Figure 5. The traffic count data are
included in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 2. The
results show that the following signalized study intersections currently operate at an unacceptable level of service:
       Meekland Avenue and Hampton Road – LOS during the AM peak hour
       Mission Boulevard and Hampton Road – LOS during the PM peak hour

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions were observed in the field in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm the
accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing traffic problems
that may not be directly related to intersection level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the level of
service calculation does not accurately reflect level of service in the field.
Overall the study intersections operated well during both the AM and PM peak hours, and the level of service
analysis appears to accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.

Baseline Conditions
This chapter describes near-term background traffic conditions without implementation of the Cherryland
Community Center project, and describes the procedures used to estimate baseline or near term no project traffic
volumes.

Future Roadway Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under near term no project conditions, including
roadways and intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under existing conditions.

Near Term No Project Traffic Volumes
Near term traffic volumes without implementation of the project were estimated by applying an annual growth rate
of 1 percent to existing traffic volumes, over a two-year period. An annual growth rate of 1 percent is commonly
used to estimate traffic growth resulting from future developments. This approach to determine potential growth
resulting from future developments in the project area has been used on past projects and endorsed by staff in
the City of Hayward and is subject to review and approval by Alameda County staff. The approach aligns with the
general concept that there are no approved projects in the study area. Thus, the 1 percent annual growth was
used to account for approval of any projects in the near future. The near term no project peak hour traffic volumes
are shown on Figure 9.

Near Term No Project Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under near term no project conditions are summarized in
Table 3. The results show that the two signalized study intersections would operate at an acceptable level of
service under near term no project conditions.
The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix B.

Baseline Project Conditions
This chapter describes how near term traffic conditions would be altered by implementation of the Cherryland
Community Center (hereafter called project). It includes a description of the method by which project traffic was
estimated, as well as any impacts caused by the project. Baseline or near term project conditions were evaluated
relative to near term conditions without the project in order to determine potential project impacts. The effects of
the proposed project on vehicular access, on-site circulation and parking are then described. The chapter is
concluded with a discussion of the effects of the project on transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities in the project
area.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria used to
determine impacts on intersections are based on Alameda County Level of Service standards.

Alameda County Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection in
unincorporated Alameda County if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under baseline
       conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under project conditions,
    2. The level of service at the intersection degrades from a LOS E under baseline conditions to an
       unacceptable LOS F under project conditions, or
    3. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS F under baseline conditions and the
       project causes the delay to increase by four (4) or more seconds.
A significant impact by Alameda County standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection level of service to an acceptable LOS D or better, unless the cost of
mitigating an intersection back to LOS D is prohibitive. Alameda County will ultimately make this determination.

Transportation Network Under Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under project conditions, including roadways and
intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under near term no project conditions.



                                                                                                        Page | 16

Project Trip Estimates and Traffic Volumes
New trips generated by the Cherryland Community Center project were estimated by applying trip generation
rates from the, "ITE Trip Generation Manual", Ninth Edition. Based on the average trip rates of community centers
included in the survey, the project would generate 36 AM peak hour trips and 48 PM peak hour trips. Based on
the average inbound/outbound splits that were surveyed, the project would produce 24 inbound and 12 outbound
trips during the AM peak hour, and 27 inbound and 21 outbound trips during the PM peak hour. The trip
generation estimates are presented below in Table 4.

Project trips were added to the Near Term No Project traffic volumes to represent Near Term Project traffic
conditions with implementation of the project (hereafter called near term project traffic volumes). Figure 10 shows
near term project traffic volumes at the study intersection locations.

Project Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under near term project conditions are summarized in
Table 5. The results show that the two signalized study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service
under near term project conditions.

Site Access and Site Circulation
According to the proposed site plan, the Cherryland Community Center would have vehicular access at a single
driveway on Hampton Road. Overall, the site plan exhibits good on-site circulation for vehicles. Based on the site
plan, the parking would be 90-degree head-in parking.
The one driveway on Hampton Road would have a throat length of approximately 20 feet. Although limited in
terms of accommodating stacked cars leaving the lot, the traffic volumes on Hampton Road are relatively low.
According to the site plan, the 19-space parking lot located adjacent to the building has a dead-end aisle. This
means that vehicles need to turn around within the aisle if they have not located a vacant space, in order to exit
the parking lot. If turnover on the site is not high, this is generally not an issue

On-Site Parking
The site plan shows that 19 parking spaces will be provided in a parking lot accessed from Hampton Road. In
addition, as part of this project, the existing parking lot at Meek Park will be expanded to a total of 89 spaces.
According to a parking space occupancy survey completed for this study in September and October of 2013, the
Meek Park parking lot was approximately 63 percent at capacity on average, by approximately 4 PM on a typical
weekend day. This average occupancy was based on the existing 56-space (approximate) lot for Meek Park. A
detailed parking memorandum is contained in Appendix C. The proposed project includes a plan to expand the
Meek Park parking lot from 56 spaces to 89 spaces. In addition, there is available on-street parking. Based on the
estimate of parking demand for the community center, approximately 86 additional spaces would be required
(Source: ITE Parking Generation Manual). The estimated parking supply is as follows:

       The proposed community center parking facility would provide a total of 19 parking spaces,
       A total of 33 additional spaces are proposed for the Meek Park parking lot, and
       Approximately 28 spaces on average would be available of existing parking (lot and on-street spaces).


Based on these factors the estimated parking supply is approximately 80 spaces. This proposed parking supply
falls slightly short of the estimated 86 necessary. Since there is on-street parking outside the two-block perimeter
that was included in these estimates, the likely outcome is that some visitors of the community center may need
to park 2 blocks away or more. Although there is no empirical research on the sharing of parking opportunities for
the two uses (Meek Park and the proposed community center), it is possible that some users of the community
center will overlap with those visiting the park. This aspect of shared parking was not assumed in the estimates,
so the 86 parking spaces for the community center are potentially a conservative estimate. Also the Hayward
Area Recreation District, which will coordinate activities at the proposed community center, anticipates
coordinating activities between the park uses and the community center such that major activities do not overlap.
This aspect will significantly improve the chances of providing sufficient available parking for the community
center.

Other Transportation Issues
Transit Facilities
The proposed community center will be served by ACTransit bus lines on Meekland Avenue and Mission
Boulevard, but there are no routes serving Hampton Road. Route 32 on Meekland Avenue provides service
between BART Bayfair station and downtown Hayward and has 60-minute headways on weekends. On Mission
Boulevard, routes 93 and 99. Line 93 with headways of 60 minutes on weekends, provides service between the
BART Bayfair station and Meekland Avenue. Line 99 provides service between BART Bayfair station and BART
Fremont station, and operates with 30 minute weekend headways. New transit riders resulting from the project
are not expected to be significant, in particular due to the distance of nearby transit. Thus, no improvements to the
existing transit service would be necessary as a result of the project.

Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian traffic primarily would be generated by local residents walking to and from the proposed community
center, bus stops, and Meek Park. All of the roadways in the project area currently have sidewalks on both sides
of the street, with crosswalks and pedestrian push buttons and signal heads at the major intersections. The
extensive network of sidewalks within the study area would continue to provide users of the community center
with a safe connection between the project and other surrounding land uses in the area.

Bicycle Facilities
As described in the Existing Conditions chapter, there are very few bicycle facilities in the project area. There are
no proposed bike lanes as part of this project. The project is not expected to generate a significant number of
additional bicycle trips. Bicyclists will share the road with vehicular traffic. Since the proposed project would have
a relatively small effect on the total bicycle trips in the study area, and forecast traffic volumes on Hampton Road
are relatively low, no improvements to bicycle facilities would be necessary as a result of the project.
In summary, the proposed project would not have an adverse effect on the existing transit, pedestrian or bicycle
facilities in the study area.

2035 Cumulative Conditions
This chapter describes 2035 Cumulative traffic conditions with implementation of the Cherryland Community
Center project, and describes the procedure used to determine 2035 Cumulative traffic volumes. It is assumed in
this analysis that the transportation network under 2035 Cumulative conditions, including roadways and
intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under Near Term Project conditions.

2035 Cumulative Traffic Volumes
Additional trips generated by potential future developments in the project area, beyond the near term horizon,
were estimated by utilizing 2035 forecast data from the Alameda County Transportation Model (ACTM). The
ACTM is maintained by the Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC) and includes models of AM and
PM peak hour traffic. Review of the input land use forecasts to the transportation model indicated that in all
probability, the county's forecast assumed the community center project. Therefore, the 2035 traffic volumes for
the cumulative without project scenario were estimated by subtracting the community center project trips from the
2035 forecast volumes. The resulting 2035 cumulative traffic volumes, both with and without the project were then
used to generate 2035 forecast turn movements manually. 2035 cumulative project traffic volumes are shown on
Figure 11.

2035 Cumulative Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under 2035 Cumulative conditions are summarized in
Table 7. The results show that the following signalized study intersection would operate at an unacceptable level
of service under 2035 Cumulative conditions:
       Mission Boulevard and Hampton Road – LOS F during the AM peak hour

Also shown in Table 6 is that average delay at the intersection of Mission Boulevard and Hampton Road does not
increase with the project during the AM peak hour, therefore this intersection does not have a significant impact.
The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix B.

Conclusions
The purpose of the traffic study was to identify any traffic-related impacts that would result from the proposed
Cherryland community center. The project is located near the northeast corner of Boston Road and Hampton
Road in the community of Cherryland in unincorporated Alameda County. The proposed project involves
construction of one new buildings and demolition of one residence. The project would generate a relatively low
volume of traffic. The project would add a driveway on Hampton Road.

Project Intersection Analysis
The results show that the two signalized study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service under
near term project conditions.
The results of the cumulative analysis show that the signalized study intersection of Mission Boulevard and
Hampton Road would operate at unacceptable levels of service, both with and without the project, in the AM peak
hour. Since the average delay at the intersection does not increase with the project compared to without the
project, this result does not constitute a significant impact.

On-Site Parking
The estimated parking supply of 80 spaces falls slightly short of the estimated 86 spaces necessary. Since there
is on-street parking outside the two-block perimeter that was included in the supply estimates, the likely outcome
is that some visitors of the community center may need to park 2 blocks away or more. Although there is no
empirical research on the sharing of parking opportunities for the two uses (Meek Park and the proposed
community center), it is possible that some users of the community center will overlap with those visiting the park.
This aspect of shared parking was not assumed in the estimates, so the 86 parking spaces for the community
center are potentially a conservative estimate. Also the Hayward Area Recreation District, which will coordinate
activities at the proposed community center, anticipates coordinating activities between the park uses and the
community center such that major activities do not overlap. This aspect will significantly improve the chances of
providing sufficient available parking for the community center.

Other Transportation Issues
The proposed community center project would not have a significant adverse effect on existing transit, pedestrian,
or bicycle facilities in the study area.

Subject:         Parking Demand for Proposed Cherryland Community Center



Introduction
Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc. has completed a parking analysis for the proposed community
center in Cherryland, California (unincorporated Alameda County). This memorandum describes the parking
needs associated with the proposed community center.

Project Description
The proposed project is for a community center on 17,113 square feet of land adjacent to the Meeks Estate
Park in Cherryland, California. There are 23 parking spaces planned on the site, that will be accessed from
Hampton Road.

Parking Demand
An estimate of the parking demand created by the proposed project was based on rates for the recreational
                                                                                                th
community center land use in the Institute of Traffic Engineers’ Manual on Parking Generation, 4 edition.
The total parking demand based on this ITE rate is presented in Table 1.
The resulting number of parking spaces needed for the proposed community center is 86 spaces. Since only
23 spaces are being planned on-site, an estimated 63 parking spaces will be needed off-site in the nearby
vicinity.
The proposed project is located adjacent to the Meeks Estate park, which has a surface parking lot and some
nearby on-street parking. The surface parking lot is accessed via Boston Road. The nearby on-street parking
being considered is:

      •   On the north side of Hampton Rd, east of Boston Road,
      •   On the north side of Hampton Rd, west of Boston Road, and
      •   On Boston Road north of Hampton Rd (west side only).
The total number of available parking supply for the above locations plus the surface lot for the park was
estimated at 74 spaces.
Parking demand was surveyed on one Saturday (October 5, 2013) and one Sunday (September 29, 2013)
between the hours of Noon and 5 PM. The peak parking was recorded to occur on Saturday around 4 PM,
with parking demand of 64 spaces. Based on this analysis, under peak conditions for Meeks Estate Park,
approximately 10 spaces would be available for the proposed community center, compared with an estimated
need for 63 additional parking spaces associated with the community center.
On Sunday, the peak parking demand was lower than on Saturday, with a recorded maximum parking
demand of 29 spaces that occurred at approximately 4 PM and 5 PM. Based on analyzing conditions on
Sunday, under peak conditions for Meeks Estate Park, approximately 45 spaces would be available for the

proposed community center, compared with an estimated need for 63 additional parking spaces associated
with the community center.
Anecdotal information was obtained from the Hayward Area Recreation and Park District (HARD), regarding
the schedule of events that were registered for the two survey days. On Sunday September 29, activities
included a party at one of the picnic sites. On Saturday October 5, the recorded activities also included a
party at one of the picnic sites. Recorded events for both days were very similar, even though the parking
demand recorded on both days varied fairly significantly.
Based on the findings, the amount of parking demand for both the existing park and the proposed community
center will potentially be greater than the proposed parking supply plus existing parking. The parking demand
estimated for the proposed community center is 86 spaces, 23 of which will be provided on site. This leaves a
gap of 63 spaces. The estimated parking supply of the parking lot and existing on-street parking is 74 parking
spaces. The parking utilization associated with the park would need to be 11 spaces or less, in order for the
estimated parking demand of the community center to be met. If HARD is willing to coordinate activities then
it could be possible to coordinate events at both the park and at the proposed community center such that
adequate parking can be provided. Other options would be to provide additional parking near the site.

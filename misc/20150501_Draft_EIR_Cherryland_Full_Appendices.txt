Re:                Notice of Preparation (NOP) of an Environmental Impact Report
                   (EIR) for the Cherryland Community Center Project

The County of Alameda (Lead Agency) will prepare an EIR for the proposed Cherryland
Community Center project (Project). This Notice of Preparation (NOP) is being distributed
to applicable responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and interested parties as required by
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Comments from agencies and interested
parties are requested as to the scope and content of the environmental review in
connection with the proposed Project. The Project location and project description are
summarized below.

Project Location: The Project site is located at 278 Hampton Road (APN 413-35-010),
17482 Boston Road (APN 413-35-14-03), and the Meek Estate Park parking lot (APN 413-
35-19-2) in the community of Cherryland in unincorporated Alameda County. The
Community Center would be constructed on two parcels totaling 56,968 square feet or
approximately 1.3 acres. The total Project area including the existing parking lot is
approximately 2.2 acres. Figure 1 and 2 illustrate the regional and Project site location and
boundaries.

The T-shaped Community Center site is bounded on the south by two-lane Hampton Road
and on the west by Boston Road. The Project would also be located on the Meek Estate
Park parking lot, a separate parcel, which is located and accessed from the end of the
Boston Road cul-de-sac. Residential properties are located to the east, north, and west of
the Community Center parcels and to the south of the Meek Estate Park parking lot parcel.

Proposed Project: The proposed Project involves the demolition of an existing structure
and concrete pads on the Project site, construction of the new 17,500 square feet
Cherryland Community Center, and reconfiguration and improvements to the existing



Cherryland Community Center Project                                                   Page 1
County of Alameda                                                          February 9, 2015


Meek Estate Park parking lot. Alameda County has partnered with Hayward Area
Recreation & Park District (HARD) to design and construct the Cherryland Community
Center. The facility would be owned by Alameda County and once construction is
completed, HARD would be responsible for the ongoing programming, operations, and
maintenance of the Cherryland Community Center.

The Project’s expressed goal is to provide a gathering place and community focal point for
local residents of all ages. The facility would include a lobby/reception gathering space
area, a 5,000 square feet Community Event Room with adjoining courtyard and
commercial kitchen, three (3) Multiple Activity Rooms, a Satellite Library, and additional
space for pre-K facilities; all surrounded by active outdoor use areas and generous
plantings. The Project would provide space for a number of uses including wedding
receptions, lectures, performances, speaking engagements; yoga, art and exercise
classes; reading programs, library and computer/technology access; and a diverse array
of educational and recreational classes.

The Cherryland Community Center would be comprised of a single-story structure with
wooden trusses, glazed windows with sun-screening, and a series of canopies would
provide an open and bright sensibility to the spaces. The Project would include light
monitors (windows located along the roof line), a hearth in the lobby, and morning and
afternoon porches to create comfortable spaces for the community. Spaces within the
building would frame views to a series of courtyards with intimate seating, Bay-Friendly
plantings, and non-fruiting trees in reference to the nearby Meek Estate. The Project would
include site lighting, stormwater treatment features, and accommodate fire and emergency
access per County code. A site plan for the building is shown in Figure 3.

Access to the Project would be provided from Boston Road and Hampton Road. On-site
parking for 20 automobiles would be provided on the Hampton Road parcel. Additional off-
site parking for special events would be provided in the existing, re-configured Meek
Estate Park parking lot, located north of the Community Center on Boston Road. This
existing parking lot would be reconfigured as part of the proposed Project to provide
parking for 104 vehicles and would provide enhanced pedestrian connections to the
Community Center, providing a total of 124 spaces to accommodate the Project,.
Additional improvements to the parking lot include installation of storm water treatment
devices, screening for adjacent residential properties, improved site lighting, and
pedestrian and vehicular circulation improvements.

Estimated Project construction is scheduled to start during the summer of 2015 and be
completed by the fall of 2016.

Probable Environmental Effects: Based on the project description and the Lead
Agency’s understanding of the environmental issues associated with the Project, the
following topics will be analyzed in the EIR, including: Aesthetics, Air Quality/Greenhouse
Gases, Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, Geology and Soils, Hazards and
Hazardous Materials, Hydrology and Water Quality, Land Use/Planning, Noise, Public
Services and Recreation, Transportation/Traffic, and Utilities and Service Systems. No
agricultural or mineral resources are located on the site and the Project would not
generate an increase in population in the County; therefore, agricultural resources, mineral
resources, and population and housing will be only briefly addressed in the EIR. The

               Geotechnical Investigation
               Cherryland Community Center
               278 Hampton Road/17482 Boston Road
               Cherryland, California

Dear Mr. Laczko,

Attached is our final geotechnical report, April 4, 2014, for the proposed Cherryland
Community Center to be constructed in Cherryland, California. Our services were
provided in accordance with our Professional Services Contract with the County of
Alameda, dated September 17, 2013.

The project site is comprised of two adjacent parcels at 278 Hampton Road and 17482
Boston Road. The 278 Hampton Road parcel is relatively level and is currently a vacant
lot with several mature trees. It is partly covered with asphalt concrete pavement and
concrete pads associated with previous development on the site. Based on our review of
historic photographs available on Google Earth, it appears three structures previously
occupied the 278 Hampton Road site, including a residence in the front half of the site
and two long rectangular structures in the rear half of the site. The 17482 Boston Road
parcel slopes up very gently to the east and is currently occupied by a vacant 1- to 2-story
residence with a small front and backyard.

Plans are to construct a 20,000-square-foot, one-story community center on the site. The
currently proposed building layout consists of three buildings along the west and north
sides of the 278 Hampton Road parcel and one building on the north side of the 17482
Boston Road parcel. We anticipate the buildings will be framed in wood or light-gauge
metal and will have concrete slab-on-grade floors located near existing grades. Structural
design loads were not available at the time this report was prepared; however, we expect
the loads will be light as is typical for these types of structures. We anticipate

improvements on the remainder of the two parcels will include parking areas, concrete
flatwork, new utilities, and landscaping.

From a geotechnical standpoint, we conclude the site can be developed as planned,
provided the recommendations presented in this report are incorporated into the project
plans and specifications and implemented during construction. The site is underlain by
up to about 15 feet of sandy silt, silty sand, and sand. The upper sandy silt layer is
susceptible to severe collapse when wetted under moderate loading. The underlying
loose to medium dense sand and silty sand is susceptible to cyclic densification during a
major earthquake, which will result in settlement of improvements supported at grade.
Spread footing foundations bearing on the collapsible sandy silt in its existing condition
may experience excessive static settlement when the soil is wetted from irrigation or
other sources. The potential for settlement due to wetting can be mitigated, however, by
overexcavating and compacting the sandy silt. Therefore, we conclude the proposed
buildings may be supported on spread footings bearing on recompacted soil (engineered
fill). Specific recommendations for compaction of the engineered fill and other
geotechnical aspects of the project are presented herein.

The recommendations contained in our report are based on a limited subsurface
exploration. Consequently, variations between expected and actual subsurface conditions
may be found in localized areas during construction. Therefore, we should be engaged to
observe site grading and foundation installation during which time we may make changes
in our recommendations, if deemed necessary.

We appreciate the opportunity to provide our services to you on this project. If you have
any questions, please call.

1.0      INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of the geotechnical investigation performed by Rockridge
Geotechnical, Inc. for the proposed Cherryland Community Center to be constructed in
Cherryland, California. The site is located on the north side of Hampton Road between Boston
Road and Standish Avenue, as shown on the Site Location Map (Figure 1).

The project site is comprised of two adjacent parcels at 278 Hampton Road and 17482 Boston
Road. The 278 Hampton Road parcel is relatively level and is currently a vacant lot with several
mature trees. It is partly covered with asphalt concrete pavement and concrete pads associated
with previous development on the site. Based on our review of historic photographs available on
Google Earth, it appears three structures previously occupied the 278 Hampton Road site,
including a residence in the front half of the site and two long rectangular structures in the rear
half of the site. The 17482 Boston Road parcel slopes up very gently to the east and is currently
occupied by a vacant 1- to 2-story residence with a small front and backyard.

Plans are to construct a 20,000-square-foot, one-story community center on the site. The
currently proposed building layout, which is shown on Figure 2, consists of three buildings along
the west and north sides of the 278 Hampton Road parcel and one building on the north side of
the 17482 Boston Road parcel. We anticipate the buildings will be framed in wood or light-
gauge metal and will have concrete slab-on-grade floors located near existing grades. Structural
design loads were not available at the time this report was prepared; however, we expect the
loads will be light as is typical for these types of structures. We anticipate improvements on the
remainder of the two parcels will include parking areas, concrete flatwork, new utilities, and
landscaping.

2.0       SCOPE OF WORK

Our geotechnical investigation was performed in accordance with our proposal dated September
13, 2013 and our Professional Services Contract with the County of Alameda, dated September
17, 2013. Our scope of services consisted of exploring subsurface conditions at the site by
drilling five test borings and advancing two cone penetration tests (CPTs), and performing
laboratory testing and engineering analyses to develop conclusions and recommendations
regarding:

         site seismicity and seismic hazards, including the potential for liquefaction and lateral
          spreading, and total and differential settlement resulting from liquefaction and/or cyclic
          densification
         the most appropriate foundation type for the proposed structures
         design criteria for the recommended foundation type(s), including vertical and lateral
          capacities
         estimates of foundation settlement under static and seismic conditions
         site grading and excavation, including criteria for fill quality and compaction
         subgrade preparation for interior and exterior concrete slabs-on-grade
         corrosivity of the near-surface soil and the potential effects on buried concrete and metal
          structures and foundations
         flexible (asphalt concrete) and rigid (Portland cement concrete) pavement design
         2013 California Building Code (CBC) site class and design spectral response acceleration
          parameters
         construction considerations.


3.0       FIELD INVESTIGATION

Subsurface conditions at the site were explored by drilling five test borings and advancing two
CPTs at the approximate locations shown on Figure 2. Prior to advancing the test borings and
CPTs, we obtained a drilling permit from the Alameda County Public Works Agency (ACPWA).
We also contacted Underground Service Alert (USA) to notify them of our work, as required by
law and retained a private utility locator, Precision Locating, LLC, to confirm the borings and




13-590                                             2                                        April 4, 2014
CPT locations were clear of existing utilites. We also performed infiltration testing of the near-
surface at three locations selected by the project team to provide information for design of bio-
retention areas.

3.1       Test Borings

Five test borings, designated as Borings B-1 through B-5, were drilled on November 20, 2013 by
Exploration GeoServices of San Jose, California at the approximate locations shown on Figure 2.
The borings were each drilled to a depth of 26-1/2 feet below the existing ground surface (bgs)
using a truck-mounted drill rig equipped with eight-inch-diameter hollow-stem augers. During
drilling, our field engineer logged the soil encountered and obtained representative samples for
visual classification and laboratory testing. The boring logs are presented on Figures A-1
through A-5 in Appendix A. The soil encountered in the borings was classified in accordance
with the classification chart presented on Figure A-6 in Appendix A.

Soil samples were obtained using the following samplers:

         Sprague and Henwood (S&H) split-barrel sampler with a 3.0-inch outside diameter and
          2.5-inch inside diameter, lined with 2.43-inch inside diameter brass tubes.
         Standard Penetration Test (SPT) split-barrel sampler with a 2.0-inch outside and 1.5-inch
          inside diameter, without liners.

The samplers were driven with a 140-pound, downhole wireline hammer falling about 30 inches
per drop. Dynamic testing performed on this hammer by GRL Engineers, Inc. on April 5, 2013
indicates the average energy transfer ratio for this hammer is 37 percent. The samplers were 18
inches at each sample depth and the hammer blows required to drive the samplers were recorded
every six inches and are presented on the boring logs. A “blow count” is defined as the number
of hammer blows per six inches of penetration or 50 blows for six inches or less of penetration.
The blow counts required to drive the S&H and SPT samplers were converted to approximate
SPT N-values using factors of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, to account for sampler type and
approximate hammer energy. The blow counts used for this conversion were the last two blow
counts. The converted SPT N-values are presented on the boring logs.

Upon completion of drilling, the boreholes were backfilled with cement grout under the
observation of the ACPWA inspector. The soil cuttings generated by the borings spread on the
ground surface next to the borings.

3.2      Cone Penetration Tests

Two CPTs, designated as CPT-1 and CPT-2, were performed to provide in-situ soil data at the
approximate locations shown on Figure 2. John Sarmiento & Associates of Orinda, California
advanced the CPTs on November 20, 2013, each to a depth of 50 feet bgs.

The CPTs were performed by hydraulically pushing a 1.4-inch-diameter cone-tipped probe with
a projected area of 10 square centimeters into the ground. The cone-tipped probe measured tip
resistance and the friction sleeve behind the cone tip measured frictional resistance. Electrical
strain gauges within the cone continuously measured soil parameters for the entire depth
advanced. Soil data, including tip resistance and frictional resistance, were recorded by a
computer while the test was conducted. Accumulated data were processed by computer to
provide engineering information such as the types and approximate strength characteristics of the
soil encountered. The CPT logs, showing tip resistance and friction ratio by depth, as well as
interpreted SPT N-values, soil shear strength parameters, and soil classifications, are presented in
Appendix A on Figures A-7 and A-8. Upon completion, the CPTs were backfilled with cement
grout.

3.3      Laboratory Testing

We re-examined the soil samples obtained from our borings to confirm the field classifications
and select representative samples for laboratory testing. Soil samples were tested to measure
moisture content, dry density, fines content (i.e., particles passing the No. 200 sieve), collapse
potential, corrosivity, and resistance value (R-value). The results of the laboratory tests are
presented on the boring logs and in Appendix B.

3.4      Infiltration Testing

To provide information on the infiltration rate (i.e., permeability) of the near-surface soil, we
performed infiltration tests on March 7, 2014 at the three locations designated as I-1 through I-3
on Figure 2. The infiltration tests were performed at the bottom of two-foot-square test pits
excavated to a depth of approximately two feet bgs. The soil exposed at the bottom of the test
pits consisted of sandy silt with some clay at the I-1 and I-3 locations and silty sand at the I-2
location. To check whether a soil with higher permeability was present below the relatively low-
permeability near-surface soil, we hand-augered a boring to a depth of seven feet bgs about five
feet horizontally from the infiltration test locations. At all three locations, the soil type was
relatively uniform to a depth of seven feet bgs.

We performed the infiltration tests using a 12-inch-diameter single-ring infiltrometer. The space
between the test pit walls and the infiltrometer was filled with water to the same level as the
water inside the infiltrometer to prevent seepage around the edge of the infiltrometer. The
infiltration rate at the I-1 location ranged from about 0.3 to 1 inch/hour for the first 2-1/4 hours
of the test while the soil below the test pit was being saturated; however, the rate slowed to
essentially zero for the next hour (i.e., after saturation). At the I-3 location, the infiltration rate
was essentially zero throughout the hour-long test period and, therefore, the test was terminated.
At the I-2 location, the initial infiltration rate was as high as 7 inches/hour, but the rate gradually
slowed as the soil became saturated. After about 2-1/2 hours, a steady infiltration rate of 1.9
inches per hour was measured.


4.0      SUBSURFACE CONDITIONS

The project site, as shown on Figure 5, is underlain by Holocene-age (11,000 years old to recent)
natural alluvial fan levee deposits associated with flooding of nearby San Lorenzo Creek. Our
borings and CPTs indicate the site is blanketed by approximately 10 to 15 feet of slightly moist,
medium stiff to stiff, non-plastic sandy silt and loose to medium dense sand and silty sand.




13-590                                              5                                        April 4, 2014
Laboratory collapse potential tests indicate the upper sandy silt layer is susceptible to severe
collapse when saturated under moderate loading.

The sandy silt/silty sand is underlain by stiff to very stiff clay and sandy clay of low to moderate
plasticity interbedded with occasional layers of medium dense to dense sand and silty sand.
These sand and silty sand layers are generally thin (less than two feet thick), except at CPT-2,
where dense sand was encountered between depths of 43 and 50 feet bgs, the maximum depth
explored.

Groundwater was not encountered in the borings, which were each drilled to a depth of 26.5 feet
bgs. Groundwater was measured at depths of approximately 30 and 27 feet bgs in CPT-1 and
CPT-2, respectively. To estimate the depth of the historically high groundwater, we reviewed
the publication by the California Geological Survey titled Seismic Hazard Zone Report for the
Hayward 7.5-Minute Quadrangle, Alameda County, California (2003). According to Plate 1.2 in
the report, the depth to the historically high groundwater in the immediate site vicinity is 20 feet
bgs. We anticipate the depth to groundwater varies several feet seasonally, depending on rainfall
amounts.


5.0      SEISMIC CONSIDERATIONS

5.1      Regional Seismicity

The site is located in the Coast Ranges geomorphic province of California that is characterized
by northwest-trending valleys and ridges. These topographic features are controlled by folds and
faults that resulted from the collision of the Farallon plate and North American plate and
subsequent strike-slip faulting along the San Andreas Fault system. The San Andreas Fault is
more than 600 miles long from Point Arena in the north to the Gulf of California in the south.
The Coast Ranges province is bounded on the east by the Great Valley and on the west by the
Pacific Ocean.

The major active faults in the area are the Hayward, San Andreas, Calaveras, and San Gregorio
faults. These and other faults in the region are shown on Figure 4. For these and other active
faults within a 50-kilometer radius of the site, the distance from the site and estimated mean
characteristic Moment magnitude1 [2007 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities
(WGCEP) (USGS 2008) and Cao et al. (2003)] are summarized in Table 1.

Since 1800, four major earthquakes have been recorded on the San Andreas Fault. In 1836, an
earthquake with an estimated maximum intensity of VII on the Modified Mercalli (MM) scale
occurred east of Monterey Bay on the San Andreas Fault (Toppozada and Borchardt 1998). The
estimated Moment magnitude, Mw, for this earthquake is about 6.25. In 1838, an earthquake
occurred with an estimated intensity of about VIII-IX (MM), corresponding to an Mw of about
7.5. The San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 caused the most significant damage in the history of
the Bay Area in terms of loss of lives and property damage. This earthquake created a surface
rupture along the San Andreas Fault from Shelter Cove to San Juan Bautista approximately 470
kilometers in length. It had a maximum intensity of XI (MM), an Mw of about 7.9, and was felt
560 kilometers away in Oregon, Nevada, and Los Angeles. The most recent earthquake to affect
the Bay Area was the Loma Prieta Earthquake of 17 October 1989 with an Mw of 6.9. This
earthquake occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains about 75 kilometers south of the site.

In 1868, an earthquake with an estimated maximum intensity of X on the MM scale occurred on
the southern segment (between San Leandro and Fremont) of the Hayward Fault. The estimated
Mw for the earthquake is 7.0. In 1861, an earthquake of unknown magnitude (probably an Mw of
about 6.5) was reported on the Calaveras Fault. The most recent significant earthquake on this
fault was the 1984 Morgan Hill earthquake (Mw = 6.2).

The U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) 2007 WGCEP has compiled the earthquake fault research
for the San Francisco Bay area in order to estimate the probability of fault segment rupture.
They have determined that the overall probability of moment magnitude 6.7 or greater
earthquake occurring in the San Francisco Bay Region during the next thirty years is 63 percent.
The highest probabilities are assigned to the Hayward/Rodgers Creek Fault and the northern
segment of the San Andreas Fault. These probabilities are 31 and 21 percent, respectively
(USGS 2008).

5.2       Geologic Hazards

Because the project site is in a seismically active region, we evaluated the potential for
earthquake-induced geologic hazards including ground shaking, ground surface rupture,
liquefaction,2 lateral spreading,3 and cyclic densification4. We used the results of our field
investigation to evaluate the potential of these phenomena occurring at the project site.


5.2.1 Ground Shaking

The ground shaking intensity felt at the project site will depend on: 1) the size of the earthquake
(magnitude), 2) the distance from the site to the fault source, 3) the directivity (focusing of
earthquake energy along the fault in the direction of the rupture), and 4) subsurface conditions.
The site is about two kilometers from the Hayward Fault. Therefore, the potential exists for a
large earthquake to induce strong to very strong ground shaking at the site during the life of the
project.


5.2.2 Ground Surface Rupture

Historically, ground surface displacements closely follow the trace of geologically young faults.
The site is not within an Earthquake Fault Zone, as defined by the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zoning Act, and no known active or potentially active faults exist on the site. We therefore
conclude the risk of fault offset at the site from a known active fault is very low. In a seismically
active area, the remote possibility exists for future faulting in areas where no faults previously
existed; however, we conclude the risk of surface faulting and consequent secondary ground
failure from previously unknown faults is also very low.

      Liquefaction is a phenomenon where loose, saturated, cohesionless soil experiences temporary
      reduction in strength during cyclic loading such as that produced by earthquakes.
3
      Lateral spreading is a phenomenon in which surficial soil displaces along a shear zone that has
      formed within an underlying liquefied layer. Upon reaching mobilization, the surficial blocks are
      transported downslope or in the direction of a free face by earthquake and gravitational forces.
4
      Cyclic densification is a phenomenon in which non-saturated, cohesionless soil is compacted by
      earthquake vibrations, causing ground-surface settlement.

5.2.3    Cyclic Densification

Seismically induced compaction or cyclic densification of non-saturated sand (sand above the
groundwater table) caused by earthquake vibrations may result in differential settlement. Based
on the subsurface data from our field investigations, we conclude the sandy silty, silty sand and
sand above the groundwater table is susceptible to cyclic densification during a major
earthquake. With no recompaction of the upper five feet of soil, we estimate ground surface
settlement of up to two inches could occur due to cyclic densification during a Magnitude 7.33
earthquake generating a peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.89 times gravity (g); this peak
ground acceleration is consistent with the Maximum Considered Earthquake Geometric Mean
(MCEG) peak ground acceleration adjusted for site effects (PGAM). If the upper five feet of soil
is overexcavated and recompacted, as recommended in Section 6.1 below, we estimate total
settlement associated with cyclic densification would be less than 1-1/2 inches and differential
settlement would be less than ¾ inch over a horizontal distance of 30 feet. It should be noted the
computed cyclic densification settlement for a Magnitude 7.33 earthquake and a PGA of 0.6g is
less than ½ inch.


5.2.4    Liquefaction and Associated Hazards

Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which saturated soil temporarily loses strength from the build-
up of excess pore water pressure, especially during earthquake-induced cyclic loading. Soil
susceptible to liquefaction includes loose to medium dense sand and gravel, low-plasticity silt,
and some low-plasticity clay deposits. Flow failure, lateral spreading, differential settlement,
loss of bearing strength, ground fissures and sand boils are evidence of excess pore pressure
generation and liquefaction. We evaluated liquefaction potential at the site using the data
collected in our CPTs. Our liquefaction analysis using CPT data was performed using
methodology proposed by P.K. Robertson (2009).

As shown on Figure 5, the site has been mapped within a zone of liquefaction potential on the
map titled State of California, Sesimic Hazard Zones, Hayward Quadrangle, Official Map,

prepared by the Californa Geological Survey (CGS), dated July 2, 2003. Special Publication 117
by the California Geological Survey (2008) recommends subsurface investigations in mapped
liquefaction potential areas be performed using rotary-wash borings and/or cone penetration
tests.

Our analysis was performed using a groundwater depth of 20 feet bgs, which is consistent with
the historically high groundwater for the site vicinity. In accordance with the 2013 CBC, we
used a peak ground acceleration of 0.89 times gravity (g) in our liquefaction evaluation; this peak
ground acceleration is consistent with the Maximum Considered Earthquake Geometric Mean
(MCEG) peak ground acceleration adjusted for site effects (PGAM). We also used a Moment
magnitude 7.33 earthquake, which is consistent with the mean characteristic Moment magnitude
for the Hayward Fault, as presented in Table 1. A summary of the liquefaction analysis is
presented in Appendix C of this report.

At the CPT-1 location, thin potentially liquefiable soil layers or lenses were encountered between
depths of 23 and 48 feet feet bgs at the site. These layers are typically less than one foot thick.
We estimate ground-surface settlement associated with post-liquefaction reconsolidation of these
layers could be up to 0.6 inches. Our analysis indicates the potential for liquefaction to occur at
the CPT-2 location is low. We estimate differential settlement associated with liquefaction could
be up to ¼ inch over a horizontal distance of 30 feet.

Lateral spreading occurs when a continuous layer of soil liquefies at depth and the soil layers
above move toward an unsupported face, such as a shoreline slope, or in the direction of a
regional slope or gradient. Based on the discontinuous nature and depth of the potentially
liquefiable layers, we conclude the potential for lateral spreading to occur at the project site is
very low.

6.0      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Based on the results of our geotechnical investigation, we conclude the proposed project can be
developed as planned. The primary geotechnical concern is the presence of collapsible sandy silt
blanketing the site. This and other geotechnical concerns are discussed in the following sections.


6.1      Foundation Support and Settlement

The site is underlain by up to about 15 feet of sandy silt, silty sand, and sand. The upper sandy
silt layer is susceptible to severe collapse when wetted under moderate loading. The underlying
loose to medium dense sand and silty sand is susceptible to cyclic densification during a major
earthquake, which will result in settlement of improvements supported at grade. Spread footing
foundations bearing on the collapsible sandy silt in its existing condition may experience
excessive static settlement when the soil is wetted from irrigation or other sources. The potential
for settlement due to wetting can be mitigated, however, by overexcavating and compacting the
sandy silt. Therefore, we conclude the proposed buildings may be supported on spread footings
bearing on recompacted soil (engineered fill). The engineered fill should extend at least five feet
below the existing ground surface. Recommendations for engineered fill quality and compaction
are presented in Section 7.1.

Our settlement analyses indicate total settlement of spread footings bearing on engineered fill,
designed using the allowable bearing pressures presented in Section 7.2 of this report, will be on
the order of ½ inch and differential settlement will be less than ¼ inch over a 30-foot horizontal
distance. An additional two inches of total settlement and one inch of differential settlement
over a horizontal distance of 30 feet may occur due to a combination of cyclic densification and
post-liquefaction reconsolidation during the Maximum Credible Earthquake (i.e., PGA of 0.89g).
During a Magnitude 7.33 earthquake generating a PGA of 0.6g, the estimated seismically
induced total settlement is less than one inch and the differential settlement is about ½ inch over
a horizontal distance of 30 feet.

6.2      Construction Considerations

The soil to be excavated for the new foundations and underground utilities is expected to be
predominantly sandy silt, which is highly susceptible to “pumping” (i.e., excessive deflection
under wheel loads) when compacted at a high moisture content. If site grading is performed
during the rainy season, the sandy silt will likely have to be dried before compaction can be
achieved. Heavy rubber-tired equipment could cause pumping of the sandy silt and, therefore,
should be avoided if grading occurs during the rainy season.

Excavations that will be deeper than five feet and will be entered by workers should be sloped or
shored in accordance with CAL-OSHA standards (29 CFR Part 1926). The contractor should be
responsible for the construction and safety of temporary slopes.


6.3      Soil Corrosivity

Corrosivity testing was performed by Sunland Analytical of Rancho Cordova, California on a
sample of soil obtained during our field investigation from a depth of 3 feet bgs. The results of
the test are presented in Appendix B of this report. Based on the resistivity test results, the
sample would be classified as moderately corrosive to buried steel, which is typical of fine-
grained soil. Accordingly, buried iron, steel, cast iron, galvanized steel, and dielectric-coated
steel or iron should be properly protected against corrosion. The results indicate that sulfate ion
concentrations are insufficient to damage reinforced concrete structures below ground, and the
chloride concentration of the soil does not present a problem with reinforcing steel in buried
concrete structures.

7.0       RECOMMENDATIONS

Our recommendations for site preparation and grading, design of foundations, and other
geotechnical aspects of the project are presented in this section.


7.1       Site Preparation and Grading

Site clearing should include removal of all existing foundations, slabs, pavements, and
underground utilities. Any vegetation and the upper 3 to 4 inches of organic topsoil should be
stripped in areas to receive improvements. Tree roots with a diameter greater than 1/2 inch
within three feet of subgrade should also be removed. Removed asphalt concrete and concrete
should be taken to a recycling facility.

After site clearing is completed, the proposed building pads should be excavated to a depth of at
least five feet below existing site grades and at least three feet below the bottom of proposed
footings, whichever is deeper. If the embedment depth of a particular footing results in an
overexcavation deeper than five feet below existing site grades, the three-foot overexcavation
beneath that footing can be limited to an area extending beneath and three feet beyond the edges
of the footing.

Any areas to receive pavement or concrete flatwork, including sidewalks, should be excavated to
at least three feet below existing grades. The excavations should extend at least five feet beyond
the perimeters of the proposed buildings and at least three feet beyond the edges of pavement and
flatwork, except where constrained by property lines or existing utilities. The exposed subgrade
at the base of the excavations should be scarified to a depth of at least eight inches, moisture-
conditioned to above optimum moisture content, and compacted to at least 92 percent relative
compaction5. The excavated material should then be placed in lifts not exceeding eight inches in

      Relative compaction refers to the in-place dry density of soil expressed as a percentage of the
      maximum dry density of the same material, as determined by the ASTM D1557 laboratory
      compaction procedure.

loose thickness, moisture-conditioned to above optimum moisture content, and compacted to at
least 92 percent relative compaction.

Subgrade soil consisting of clean sand or gravel (defined as soil with less than 10 percent fines
by weight) should be compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction. Soil subgrade for
vehicular pavements should be compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction and be non-
yielding. The soil subgrade should be kept moist until it is covered by fill for improvements.


7.1.1    Fill Quality

Material excavated at the site will primarily consist of non-plastic sandy silt and silty sand that
may be reused as fill, provided it is free or organic matter and contain no rocks or lumps greater
than three inches in greatest dimension. If imported fill (select fill) is required, it should be free
of organic matter, contain no rocks or lumps larger than three inches in greatest dimension, have
a liquid limit less than 40 and plasticity index less than 12, and be approved by the Geotechnical
Engineer. Samples of proposed select fill material should be submitted to the Geotechnical
Engineer at least three business days prior to use at the site. The grading contractor should
provide analytical test results or other suitable environmental documentation indicating the
imported fill is free of hazardous materials at least three days before use at the site. If this data is
not available, up to two weeks should be allowed to perform analytical testing on the proposed
imported material.

7.1.2    Utility Trenches

Excavations for utility trenches can be readily made with a backhoe. All trenches should
conform to the current CAL-OSHA requirements. Excavations in areas where recompacted fill
is placed should stand vertically. For trenches excavated outside the recompacted fill areas, we
anticipate that some caving may occur in the relatively dry sandy silt.

Backfill for utility trenches and other excavations is also considered fill, and it should be
compacted according to the recommendations presented in Section 7.1. Jetting of trench backfill



13-590                                            15                                        April 4, 2014
should not be permitted. Special care should be taken when backfilling utility trenches in
pavement areas. Poor compaction may cause excessive settlements, resulting in damage to the
pavement section.

To provide uniform support, pipes or conduits should be bedded on a minimum of four inches of
sand or fine gravel. After the pipes and conduits are tested, inspected (if required) and approved,
they should be covered to a depth of six inches with sand or fine gravel, which should be
mechanically tamped.

Foundations for the proposed buildings should be bottomed below an imaginary line extending
up at a 1.5:1 (horizontal to vertical) inclination from the base of utility trenches. Alternatively,
the portion of the utility trench (excluding bedding) that is below the 1.5:1 line can be backfilled
with controlled low-strength material (CLSM) with a 28-day unconfined compressive strength of
at least 100 pounds per square inch (psi).


7.1.3    Surface Drainage

Positive surface drainage should be provided around the buildings to direct surface water away
from the foundations. To reduce the potential for water ponding adjacent to the buildings, we
recommend the ground surface within a horizontal distance of five feet from the buildings slope
down away from the buildings with a surface gradient of at least two percent in unpaved areas
and one percent in paved areas. In addition, roof downspouts should be discharged into
controlled drainage facilities to keep the water away from the foundations.
Bioretention/treatment areas within five feet of the buildings should be lined with an
impermeable membrane at least 10 mils thick, such as Stegowrap, and provided with a subdrain.


7.2      Spread Footings

We conclude the proposed buildings may be supported on continuous or individual spread
footings bottomed on properly compacted fill. Continuous footings should be at least 12 inches
wide and isolated spread footings should be at least 18 inches wide. Footings should extend at



13-590                                            16                                      April 4, 2014
least 18 inches below the lowest adjacent exterior finished grade and at least 12 inches below the
lowest adjacent interior soil subgrade, whichever is lower. Footings should also be founded
below an imaginary line extending up at an inclination of 2:1 from bioretention/treatment areas.

The footings may be designed using allowable bearing pressures of 3,000 pounds per square foot
(psf) for dead-plus-live loads and 4,000 psf for total design loads, which include wind or seismic
forces. The allowable bearing pressures include factors of safety of at least 2.0 and 1.5, for static
and transient loading conditions, respectively.

Lateral loads may be resisted by a combination of passive pressure on the vertical faces of the
footings and friction between the bottoms of the footings and the supporting soil. To compute
passive resistance, we recommend using an equivalent fluid weight of 300 pounds per cubic foot
(pcf). The upper foot of soil should be ignored unless confined by a slab or pavement. Frictional
resistance should be computed using a base friction coefficient of 0.35. These values may be
used in combination without reduction. The passive pressure and frictional resistance values
include a factor of safety of at least 1.5.

Footing excavations should be free of standing water, debris, and disturbed materials prior to
placing concrete. The bottoms and sides of the footing excavations should be moistened
following excavation and maintained in a moist condition until concrete is placed. We should
check footing excavations prior to placement of reinforcing steel.


7.3      Concrete Slab-on-Grade Floor

Where water vapor transmission through the floor slab is undesirable, we recommend installing a
capillary moisture break and a water vapor retarder beneath the slab. A capillary moisture break
consists of at least four inches of clean, free-draining gravel or crushed rock. The vapor retarder
should meet the requirements for Class B vapor retarders stated in ASTM E1745. The vapor
retarder should be placed in accordance with the requirements of ASTM E1643. These
requirements include overlapping seams by six inches, taping seams, and sealing penetrations in
the vapor retarder. If required by the structural engineer, the vapor retarder may be covered with

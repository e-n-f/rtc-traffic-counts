I. Introduction

This Corridor Traffic Study will examine the proposed development surrounding Badger Hills
Drive, analyze the effects of development generated traffic on the proposed corridor, and
examine intersection and driveway lane configurations.

The project is located in the northwest portion of Rochester, Olmsted County, Minnesota.

Badger Hills Drive as proposed would be an extension of 41st Street NW, which currently
terminates at West Circle Drive (CSAH 22) at a T-intersection. The Badger Hills Drive corridor
would extend west through currently undeveloped land and intersect with 50th Avenue NW.

The proposed development surrounding Badger Hills Road consists of single and multi-family
residential, commercial, and a proposed church/daycare. Mayo Clinic is located at the
northeast quadrant of the West Circle Drive & 41st Street NW intersection.

The study area includes the following intersections (from east to west):

    ·   West Circle Drive (CSAH 22) & 41st Street NW/Badger Hills Drive
    ·   Badger Hills Drive & Superior Drive NW (future)
    ·   Badger Hills Drive & 46th Avenue NW (future)
    ·   Badger Hills Drive & Alpha Parkway (future)
    ·   50th Avenue NW & Badger Hills Drive (future)

The design year for the study is 2040, and this report analyzed the AM and PM peak hours.

Figure 1 shows the study area including the surrounding land parcels. Figure 2 shows the
project vicinity map.

B.      EXISTING INTERSECTION GEOMETRY
West Circle Drive (CSAH 22) & 41st Street NW is a signalized T-intersection with a protected
southbound left-turn phase. The westbound approach consists of exclusive left- and right-turn
lanes. The northbound approach has two through lanes and one right-turn lane. The
southbound approach has two through lanes and one left-turn lane. A trail runs along the south
side of 41st Street NW, and sidewalk runs along the north side of 41st Street NW. There are no
pedestrian facilities for the intersection.

50th Avenue NW will intersect the future Badger Hills Drive at an existing roundabout. The
northbound and southbound approaches consist of two through lanes. The future eastbound and
westbound approaches are striped for a single lane, but have been designed to accommodate
dual lanes.

The geometric configuration of all intersections is shown in Figure 3.

C.      HOURLY TURNING MOVEMENT VOLUMES
Hourly turning movement volumes were collected as part of this study. Figure 3 displays
existing traffic volumes. These volumes can be found in the appendix.

Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes were retrieved from the Minnesota Department of
Transportation's Office of Transportation Forecasting and Analysis.

III. Methodology

A.      BASE ASSUMPTIONS

Intersection capacity analysis was conducted using Synchro v8.0 for stop-controlled and
signalized intersections. Roundabout intersections were analyzed using HCM 2010 capacity
analysis, plus SimTraffic simulations. Trip generation was calculated using the latest edition of
the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. Existing signal timing and
phasing data was provided by the City of Rochester.

B.      BACKGROUND GROWTH

Using the local model, the Rochester-Olmsted County Council of Governments (ROCOG)
provided year 2040 daily traffic volumes for the study area.

C.      TRIP GENERATION

The proposed development within the study area is expected to consist of single-family and
multi-family residential, a mix of commercial and office land uses, and a church with a daycare
center.

The land owners provided the most likely development scenarios for their parcels. The
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip generation software was used to develop the
projected trips by this development.

Table 3.1 contains the summary of the land uses and sizes used for trip generation.

C.1     B-1/B-4 Parcel

The B-1 and B-4 parcel is located on the southwest quadrant of the
West Circle Drive & Badger Hills Drive intersection. It is expected to
consist of a Kwik Trip gas station/convenience mart, a 30,000
square foot grocery store, and about 294,000 square feet of office
space. The area would be bisected by the southern leg of Superior
Drive with two public streets ending in cul-de-sacs.

Access for the office space and the grocery store would be provided
by Superior Drive. A 3/4 access is proposed to Badger Hills Drive
that would serve the Kwik Trip.

The B-1/B-4 parcel is expected to contain both retail and office
uses, and is therefore a mixed-use area. Mixed-use development
generates "internal capture" trips.

Internal capture trip reduction is a method to estimate interaction
between different land use types within the same development.
While each land use in a mixed-use development generates vehicle trips, some individuals will
visit more than one land use within the development. This phenomenon of multiple land uses
adjacent to each other ultimately results in less vehicle trips to the external road network, and
less impact, than free-standing retail, office, or residential areas. This reduction was
calculated in accordance with the manual and the worksheet is included in the Appendix.

Pass-by reductions are included to account for the phenomenon where land uses such as
convenience stores or other similar uses attract vehicles whose ultimate destination is
elsewhere. These driveway turning movement trips replace what would otherwise be "through"
movements, but do not contribute to "new trips" on the roadway network.

Table 3.1 shows a summary of trip generation, internal capture reduction, pass-by trip
reduction, and the total new peak hour trips to the roadway network.

C.2       Mayo Clinic Parcel

The Mayo Clinic Support Services Facility is located on the northeast
quadrant of the West Circle Drive & 41st Street NW intersection.

Future development is expected to consist of a 90,000 square foot
medical clinic on the southwest part of the parcel, 810,000 square feet
of medical office in the center, and a data center on the northern
portion which would generate an inconsequential amount of traffic. Trip
generation rates for these future land uses were provided by the Mayo
Support Services Center traffic study completed in October 2002.

The area currently has access on West Circle Drive, and a full access
driveway on 41st Street NW.

The West Circle Drive & Mayo access intersection was the subject of a
traffic signal warrant analysis performed in September 2010. The
conclusion of the analysis indicated that the intersection would warrant
signalized control with development on the west side of West Circle
Drive.

City Route 18 serves this parcel with five AM routes and five PM routes.
To account for transit usage by employees, this analysis will use a 2.5%
vehicle trip reduction.

Table 3.2 shows the estimated trip generation for the Mayo Clinic
parcel.

C.3     Hy Vee Parcel

The Hy Vee Retail Center is located northwest of the West
Circle Drive & Badger Hills Drive intersection. It is immediately
north of property owned by the City of Rochester.

According to the Signal Warrant Study for West Circle Drive &
Mayo access dated September 2010, the Phase I development is
proposed to consist of an 84,000 square foot supermarket, a
2,400 square foot bank, a 3,500 square foot sit-down
restaurant, 18,700 square feet of general retail, and a 16-pump
gas station.

The previous study did not include pass-by trips, but they are
included as part of this analysis.

The land use map shows a development intensity of 460,000
square feet of commercial for future phases.

Access to the Phase I development would be provided to Alpha
Parkway, Superior Drive, as well as a connection to Badger Hills
Drive that would bisect the planned ponds via a right-in/right-
out driveway.

The future phases would have access to Alpha Parkway and
Superior Drive.

Table 3.3 shows the estimated trip generation and pass-by trip
reduction for the Hy Vee parcel.

D.      TRIP DISTRIBUTION

Trip distribution was considered parcel-by-parcel based on previous trip distribution
percentages found in the Traffic Impact Report for Mayo Support Services Center, from the
transportation demand model prepared by ROCOG, as well as engineering judgment with
assistance from City of Rochester staff.

The proposed trip distribution for this project can be found in the appendix.

Pass-by trips are shown in Figure 4, and the total development trips are shown in Figure 5.

E.      BACKGROUND TRIPS

Background trips were calculated by totaling the bi-directional development PM peak hour trips
between intersections, then using a "rule of thumb" that the peak hour volume is around 10%
of AADT. Subtracting the peak hour development trips from 10% of the ROCOG projected year
2040 AADT resulted in an average of 370 background peak hour through trips in the PM peak
hour.

The AM background peak hour through trips were developed by finding the AM to PM peak hour
ratio of development traffic at the West Circle Drive & 41st Street NW intersections. The
directional splits for both AM and PM background trips were calculated by using the
development directional splits. These calculations can be found in the Appendix.

Design year volumes are shown in Figure 6.

IV. Capacity Analysis

A.      LEVEL OF SERVICE SUMMARY
The Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) utilizes a term "level of
service" to measure how traffic operates in intersections. There are currently six levels of
service ranging from A to F. Level of service "A" represents the best conditions and Level of
Service "F" represents the worst. All worksheet reports from the analyses can be found in the
Appendix. Table 4.1 shows the control delay for signalized and unsignalized levels of service.

Roundabout intersections were analyzed using HCM 2010. These results were confirmed by
observation of SimTraffic 8.0 simulation runs.

B.       WEST CIRCLE DRIVE (CSAH 22) & 41ST STREET NW/BADGER HILLS DRIVE


West Circle Drive (CSAH 22) & 41st Street NW is a signalized T-intersection with a protected
southbound left-turn phase. The westbound approach consists of exclusive left- and right-turn
lanes. The northbound approach has two through lanes and one right-turn lane. The
southbound approach has two through lanes and one left-turn lane.

The Badger Hills Drive project will add the west leg of the intersection, consisting of a left-turn
lane, two through lanes, and a right-turn lane. The project will also add a northbound left-turn
lane, and a southbound right-turn lane. The westbound approach will be revised to consist of a
left-turn lane, one through lane, and a shared through-right lane.

Under year 2040 conditions, West Circle Drive can expect to see daily traffic volumes
exceeding 40,000 vehicles per day south of 41st Street NW. The four-lane divided highway with
turn lanes will be at capacity, and analysis of this intersection with those conditions shows that
improvements will be needed.

The following improvements are recommended by year 2040. It is advised to monitor traffic
volumes at the intersection to determine the timing of these capacity improvements.

Recommended improvements

     ·   Construct a WB right-turn lane, and
     ·   Construct dual WB, NB, and SB left-turn lanes.

With those improvements, the intersection is expected to function at LOS C overall in the AM
peak hour, and LOS D overall in the PM peak hour. Table 4.2 shows the projected year 2040
levels of service, average control delay in seconds per vehicle, and 95th percentile queue for
the AM and PM peak hours for the individual turning movements.

C.       BADGER HILLS DRIVE & KWIK TRIP/HY-VEE ACCESS


The Kwik Trip and Hy-Vee accesses will be located approximately 600 feet west of the West
Circle Drive & 41st Street NW intersection.

The Kwik Trip access is proposed to be a 3/4 access, with a WB left-turn lane.

The Hy Vee access is proposed to be right-in/right-out, with a WB right-turn lane.

According to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report No. 279,
Intersection Channelization Design Guidelines, both the WB left- and right-turn lanes are
warranted. An EB right-turn lane will not be required, since many eastbound vehicles will use
the Badger Hills Drive & Superior Drive roundabout for access to the Kwik Trip. The calculations
can be found in the Appendix.

SimTraffic simulation shows that queues from the West Circle Drive & 41st Street NW
intersection would occasionally back up past the Kwik Trip driveway. The 50th percentile
backup from the eastbound approach to West Circle Drive is expected to be 390 feet.

D.       BADGER HILLS DRIVE & SUPERIOR DRIVE

The Badger Hills Drive & Superior Drive intersection is proposed to be located approximately
1100 feet west of the West Circle Drive & 41st Street NW intersection.

As a roundabout intersection, the following lane geometry would be required for year 2040
volumes.

Recommended lane geometry for roundabout control

     ·   EB and WB approaches consisting of two lanes each, and
     ·   NB and SB approaches consisting of a shared left-through lane, and a right-turn lane.

For signalized control, all approaches would have a left-turn lane, a shared through-right lane,
except the northbound approach which would have a shared left-through lane, and a right-turn
lane.

Tables 4.3 and 4.4 show the projected year 2040 LOS, delay, and 95th percentile queue for
roundabout and signalized control.

E.       BADGER HILLS DRIVE & 46TH AVENUE NW


The Badger Hills Drive & 46th Avenue NW intersection is proposed to align with the current
46th Avenue NW in the Badger Hills subdivision.

As a roundabout intersection with projected 2040 volumes, the roundabout is expected to
function acceptably as a single lane roundabout.

As a signalized intersection, a single lane of approach would be sufficient for year 2040
conditions.

Tables 4.5 and 4.6 show the projected year 2040 LOS, delay, and 95th percentile queue for
roundabout and signalized control.

F.        BADGER HILLS DRIVE & CHURCH ACCESS/R-3 ACCESS


Although not formally part of the Badger Hills Drive proposed layout, right-in/right-out
accesses for the Church and the R-3 property were included in this analysis only for the
purposes of determining lane geometry for the adjacent intersections. These right-in/right-out
accesses may be considered by the City in the future.

G.        BADGER HILLS DRIVE & ALPHA PARKWAY/CHURCH ACCESS


The Badger Hills Drive & Alpha Parkway/church access intersection is tentatively proposed to
be located 640 feet east of the 50th Avenue NW & Badger Hills Drive intersection.

As a roundabout intersection, a single lane roundabout would be sufficient for year 2040
volumes. It should be noted that Alpha Parkway is projected to be classified as a collector, and
could be an attractive alternative to Badger Hills Drive in the future. It is recommended to set
aside R/W for the addition of a southbound right-turn lane and to monitor traffic volumes to
determine when such an improvement would be needed.

As a signalized intersection, one lane approaches would suffice for year 2040 volumes.

Tables 4.7 and 4.8 show the projected year 2040 LOS, delay, and 95th percentile queue for
roundabout and signalized control.

H.       50TH AVENUE NW & BADGER HILLS DRIVE

50th Avenue NW currently has a roundabout for the future Badger Hills Drive intersection. The
northbound and southbound approaches consist of two through lanes. The future eastbound and
westbound approaches are striped for a single lane, but have been designed to accommodate
dual lanes.

With projected year 2040 volumes, the following is recommended for the roundabout.

Recommended improvements

     ·   Northbound and southbound approaches would continue to have a shared left-through,
         and a shared through-right lane.
     ·   The eastbound and westbound approaches would have a single lane approach.

It should be noted that the westbound approach would be projected to see LOS E in the PM
peak hour. Ultimately, it is expected that the westbound approach would require the addition
of a westbound right-turn lane. It is recommended to set aside R/W for a future westbound
right-turn lane.

Table 4.9 shows the projected LOS, delay, and 95th percentile queue for year 2040 conditions.

 BADGER HILLS DRIVE - ROCHESTER
V. Summary and Conclusion

This Corridor Traffic Study examined the proposed development surrounding the future Badger
Hills Drive, analyzed the effects of development generated traffic on the proposed corridor,
and examined intersection and driveway lane configurations.

This analysis examined current traffic volumes on the study intersections, assigned
development-generated trips on the surrounding roadway network, and calculated the
eastbound-westbound background trips, all to determine design year 2040 peak hour volumes.

The study performed capacity analysis on the study intersections with roundabout control and
signalized control. Based on this analysis, recommendations were provided to allow for
acceptable levels of service.

The following summarize improvements required for the Projected Year 2040 conditions:

    West Circle Drive (CSAH 22) and 41st Street NW/Badger Hills Drive (signal)

    ·   Westbound right-turn lane,
    ·   Westbound, northbound, and southbound dual left-turn lanes.

Intersection traffic volumes and operations should be monitored to determine when the
northbound and southbound improvements will be necessary.

    Badger Hills Drive & Kwik Trip/Hy-Vee access (3/4 access)

    ·   Westbound left- and right-turn lanes.

    Badger Hills Drive & Superior Drive (roundabout)

    ·   EB shared left-through and shared through-right lanes.
    ·   WB shared left-through and shared through-right lanes.
    ·   NB shared left-through, and a right-turn lane.
    ·   SB shared left-through, and a right-turn lane.

    Badger Hills Drive & 46th Avenue NW (roundabout)

    ·   Single-lane roundabout.

    Badger Hills Drive & Alpha Parkway/Church access (roundabout)

    ·   Single-lane roundabout,
    ·   It is recommended to set aside R/W for a future southbound right-turn lane, and
        monitor traffic volumes to determine when such an improvement would be needed.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Summary
This report evaluates the transportation impacts for the proposed development of the Old Sherwood
Cannery Site that is generally bounded by the Portland and Western Railroad tracks, Washington Street,
Willamette Street, and the Sherwood Old Town Field House (Public Works office). The proposed mixed
use development consists of retail, office, restaurants, multi-family residential and community recreational
uses. Development is anticipated to occur in two phases, the first to be completed by 2014 and the second
by 2017. This study focuses on traffic operations at the following existing intersections that were selected
on the basis of proportional traffic impact:
     Highway 99W & Meinecke Road                             Pine Street & Railroad Street
     Highway 99W & Edy Road/ Sherwood                        Pine Street & Columbia Street
     Boulevard                                               Pine Street & Willamette Street
     Highway 99W & Roy Rogers/Tualatin-                      Washington Street & 3rd Street

     Sherwood Boulevard & Langer Drive                       Willamette Street & Lincoln Street
     Sherwood Boulevard & Century Drive/12th                 Oregon Street & Lincoln Street
     Street                                                  Oregon Street & Murdock Road
     Pine Street & 3rd Street                                Oregon Street & Tonquin Road
     Pine Street & 1st Street

  This study also includes the proposed Site Access drive on Pine Street.

  The study area is shown in Figure 1. Other issues covered in this report include site access, trip
  generation, site circulation, pedestrians, sight distance, and safety.
  Project traffic impacts were evaluated for the weekday evening peak period (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM), when
  traffic volumes in the study area are typically highest. Traffic impacts were also evaluated during the
  morning peak period (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM). Conditions have been analyzed for the end of each
  development phase. Table 1 provides a summary of some key elements used in this impact study.

PROJECT TRAFFIC IMPACT
The additional traffic from the proposed project combined with background growth to 2017 would
degrade traffic operations below the City of Sherwood’s level of service standards at eight study
intersections. Operations at two of these intersections are currently below the standards. All three
intersections of Highway 99W and would experience a significant increase in volume-to-capacity (V/C)
ratio with the addition of background growth to 2017. However, the trips associated with the proposed
project would not worsen the operating conditions at the intersection of Highway 99W/Meinecke Road.
All other intersections would meet applicable performance standards during the three study periods.
Table 2 lists the existing intersection operating conditions and the 2017 plus project operating conditions.
 A series of transportation recommendations are outlined to reduce the transportation impacts of the
proposed development and future traffic growth.

TRANSPORTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
The additional traffic from the proposed project combined with background growth significantly impacts
the level of service at several of the study intersections. Five of these involve unsignalized intersections
and one involves a signalized intersections on Highway 99W. Two of the unsignalized intersections
(Sherwood Boulevard/Century Drive and Oregon Street/Tonquin Street) currently operate below the City
of Sherwood standards and will deteriorate further as a result of growth in non-site and site traffic. Both
of theses locations have been identified as requiring improvements in the Transportation System Plan.
To meet City of Sherwood and ODOT standards and optimize safety and circulation for the proposed
project, both on-site and off-site improvement should be required to mitigate the impacts of the proposed
project. The following improvements, based on phased development, should be required:
Mitigations for Existing Deficiencies:
         Implement the City of Sherwood TSP recommends improvements at Sherwood
         Boulevard/Century Drive by relocating the existing signal at Sherwood Boulevard/Langer Drive
         to this adjacent intersection and constructing a median to limit Sherwood Boulevard/Langer Drive
         to right-in/right-out only. This improvement is a significant capital improvement to mitigate
         conditions for side-street movements on Century Drive and may be beyond the proportional share
         of the proposed project. An alternative may be to have the development contribute a proportional
         fee-in-lieu-of for the improvements for later implementation by the City.
Mitigations for Year 2014 Background Deficiencies:
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Washington Street/3rd Street to meet City
         performance standards. This could be accomplished by the construction of a south-eastbound left
         turn lane (which would require widening or the removal of some on-street parking).
Mitigation for Phase I of Development (Year 2014):
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Pine Street/1st Street to meet City
         performance standards and mitigate queuing impacts at the Pine Street railroad crossing. This
         could be accomplished by implementing a modified circulation for the downtown streets that
         includes:
             o    Install a diverter for south-westbound on 1st Street at Ash Street or Oak Street to require
                  vehicles travelling towards Pine Street to divert to 2nd Street.
             o    Remove one side of on-street parking Ash Street-2nd Street or Oak Street-2nd Street to
                  provide two 12-foot travel lanes from the diverter to Pine Street. Convert to one-way
                  traffic flow approaching Pine Street for this segment.
             o    Install an all-way stop at Pine Street/2nd Street. Stripe the south-westbound approach of
                  2nd Street to have a left turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane.
             o    Consider installing traffic calming measures on 2nd Street southwest of Pine Street to
                  manage the impact of the added traffic.
         Restrict landscaping, monuments, or other obstructions within sight distance triangles at the
         access points to maintain adequate sight distances.
         Provide an enhanced at-grade pedestrian crossing of Pine Street to facilitate multi-modal
         circulation through the project site (e.g., signing, striping, lighting, a raised crossing, or pavement
         texturing).

         Construct Columbia Street northeast of Pine Street to City Standards and install a sign indicating
         that this roadway will be a through street in the future (connecting to Foundry Avenue).
         If the alignment of Columbia Street as a four-leg intersection is determined not to be feasible, turn
         restrictions should be implemented by requiring Columbia Street southwest of Pine Street to be
         one way south-westbound.
         Restrict parking on the southeast side of Columbia Street at a minimum within 100 feet of Pine
         Street (northeast of Pine Street).
Mitigation for Year 2017 Background Deficiencies:
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Hwy 99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road to
         meet ODOT performance standards. This could be accomplished by the construction of a south-
         westbound right turn lane. This improvement is a significant capital improvement that may
         require right of way acquisition and could be beyond the proportional share of the proposed
         project. As this intersection is identified for improvement in the Metro 2035 Financially
         Constrained RTP as part of the Tualatin-Sherwood Road widening, an alternative may be to have
         the development contribute a proportional fee-in-lieu-of for the improvements for later
         implementation by Washington County/ODOT.
Mitigations for Phase II of Development (Year 2017):
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Sherwood Boulevard/Pine Street/3rd Street
         to meet City performance standards. This could be accomplished by construction of a south-
         eastbound right turn lane, which may only require restriping and not roadway widening.
         The Adams Avenue South extension (from Tualatin-Sherwood Road to Oregon Street), which is
         a planned City CIP project and required mitigation of another development, would need to be in
         place for the intersection of 1st Street/Pine Street and 3rd Street/Pine Street to meet City
         performance standards under the year 2017 with the proposed project Phase II traffic. Phase II of
         the development should not proceed without this improvement being in place, or additional
         roadway improvement may be required to manage intersection operations and vehicle queuing
         towards the Pine Street railroad crossing.

Chapter 2: Existing Conditions
The Old Sherwood Cannery site is located in the area bounded by the Portland and Western Railroad
tracks, Washington Street, Willamette Street, and the Sherwood Old Town Field House (Public Works
office). The study area for traffic impacts was defined by those intersections potentially impacted by
the additional site generated traffic. Based upon the preliminary review of traffic conditions, the
following intersections were selected for analysis:
   Highway 99W & Meinecke Road                                 Pine Street & Railroad Street

EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Intersection turn movement counts were conducted in November 2008 and January, 2009 at the study
area intersections during the morning (7:00-9:00 a.m.) and evening peak (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) periods.
PM peak hour through volumes on Highway 99W were adjusted by a factor of 1.09 to reflect conditions
during the highest traffic volume month of the year (for 30th highest hour analysis) using factors from
ODOT’s Automated Traffic Recorder (ATR) site 36-004 located just south of Sherwood. No
adjustment was made to the AM peak hour through volumes on Highway 99W. The adjusted existing
study intersection turn movements are shown in Figure 3. The count data is included in the Appendix.


EXISTING TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
While analysis of traffic flows is useful in attempting to reach an understanding of the general nature of
traffic in an area, traffic volume alone indicates neither the ability of the street network to carry
additional traffic nor the quality of service provided by the street facilities. For this reason, the concept
of level of service (LOS) has been developed to correlate traffic volume data to subjective descriptions
of traffic performance at intersections. Intersections are the controlling bottlenecks of traffic flow, and
the ability of a roadway system to carry traffic efficiently is nearly always diminished in their vicinity.
An intersection's level of service (LOS) is similar to a "report card" rating, based on average vehicle
delay. Level of Service A, B and C indicate conditions where vehicles can move freely. Level of
service D and E are progressively worse. For signalized intersections, level of service F represents
conditions where the average delay for all vehicles through the intersection exceeds 80 seconds per
vehicle, generally indicated by long queues and delays. Under this operating condition, delay is highly
variable, and it is difficult to estimate average delay accurately because congestion often extends into
and is affected by adjacent intersections. Descriptions of levels of service for signalized and
unsignalized intersections are contained in the Appendix.
Performance standards for study intersections vary depending on the jurisdiction of the roadway. Study
intersections are currently under two jurisdictions. The three Highway 99W intersections are under
ODOT jurisdiction and are subject to intersection volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) standards as defined
in the Oregon Highway Plan (OHP) for the Portland Metropolitan Region. Highway 99W/Edy
Road/Sherwood Boulevard and Highway 99W/Roy Rogers Road/Tualatin-Sherwood Road are within a
Town Center and thus have a V/C standard of 1.10 during the peak hour. Highway 99W/Meinecke
Road has a V/C standard of 0.99 since it is located outside the Town Center. Oregon Street/Tonquin
Road is under County jurisdiction and has a standard of level of service (LOS) E or better. City of
Sherwood has jurisdiction of the remainder of the study area intersections. These intersections must
have a level of service (LOS) of D or better.
Existing and future peak hour operating conditions were determined based on the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual1 methodology for signalized and unsignalized intersections. Roundabouts were
analyzed using aaSidra software. Level of service calculation sheets are included in the Appendix.

COLLISION HISTORY
Intersection collision history for the study intersections was provided2 by ODOT and is presented in
Table 5. This data represents accidents reported between 2005-2007. Three of the study intersections
did not have any reported collisions. Highway 99W/ Tualatin-Sherwood Road is the study intersection
with the highest crash rate of 0.84 collisions per million entering vehicles (MEV). This intersection
ranks #11 on Washington County’s 2005-2007 Safety Priority Index System (SPIS), which could
warrant mitigation if the proposed project is found to exceed Washington County’s impact thresholds.
No fatalities were reported at any of the intersections during the three year period.

PUBLIC TRANSIT
TriMet provides two regularly scheduled bus routes to Sherwood. Routes 12 and 94 both provide
service between the Portland city center and Sherwood. Route 12 is a regular service that operates
approximately every 15 minutes daily. Route 94 is an express service that operates during peak periods.
 The transit stop located closest to the site is on Railroad Street at Washington Street. A park and ride
lot is located on Main Street east of the railroad.

Chapter 3: Impacts
This chapter reviews the impact of the proposed project on the existing transportation system. The
analysis includes assessment of trip generation and distribution, capacity analysis of study intersections
with existing and projected future traffic loadings, turn lane needs, and site access requirements


SITE TRIP GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION
Trip generation was estimated for the proposed Old Sherwood Cannery site based on trip rates provided
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers3 (ITE) for similar land uses. The proposed mixed use
development is anticipated to include the following uses:
            24,700 square feet (SF) of Specialty Retail space
            18,900 SF of Office space
            6,300 SF of High Turnover Sit Down Restaurant space
            8,700 SF of Community Recreational Space
            101 Apartments
Development of the site is anticipated to occur in two phases. Phase I is anticipated to be complete in
2014 with build out (Phase II) completed in 2017. Tables 6 and 7 list the estimated trips for each
component of the site use. Trips were calculated for the AM peak (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and the PM
peak (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) periods. Internal trips and pass-by trips represent conservative (low)
estimates derived from data and procedures recommended by ITE4.

Figure 4 shows the trip distribution of project trips on the study area roadways for the proposed
development. This trip distribution was based on existing traffic circulation and travel patterns
forecasted by the Metro’s 2030 financially constrained VISUM model developed for the I-5 to 99W
Connector Project. The net new site generated trips for Phases I and II were assigned to the network
using this distribution pattern. Figures 5 and 6 show the assignment of net new site trips at the study
area intersections.

FUTURE TRAFFIC FORECASTS
The analysis focused on five operating condition scenarios for the weekday AM and PM peak hours:
         Existing operating conditions (previous section)
         2014 Background Traffic (existing plus forecasted growth)
         2017 Background Traffic (existing plus forecasted growth)
         2014 Traffic Volumes with Project (existing plus forecasted growth plus site traffic)
         2017 Traffic Volumes with Project (existing plus forecasted growth plus site traffic)
For each of the future scenarios, roadway networks were assumed to be the same as under existing
conditions. The City of Sherwood CIP improvement to construct Adams Avenue between Tualatin-
Sherwood Road and Oregon Street was not included in analysis to be conservative in forecasting
impacts on study area roadways since current economic conditions make the timing of this project
unknown.
Background Traffic Volumes (2014 and 2017)
Future year volumes in the study area were estimated using the Metro 2030 financially constrained
VISUM model to estimate the incremental growth in traffic between 2005 and 2030. This model has
been utilized for the I-5 to 99W Connector Project and reflects the growth restrictions that major nearby
bottlenecks (e.g. Highway 99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road) place on the system. Figures 7 and 8
summarize these background traffic projections.
Background plus Project Conditions (2014 and 2017)
This scenario analyzes the traffic associated with the background traffic growth along with the project
related traffic volumes for the proposed site. Figure 9 and 10 shows the combined volumes for Phase I
and Build Out conditions.

FUTURE TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Table 8 lists the performance at study intersections when background traffic growth5 is added to
existing conditions. The analysis indicates substandard conditions at Sherwood Boulevard/Century
Drive and Oregon Street/Tonquin Road will continue to deteriorate, with additional peak periods
experiencing deficiency in 2014. The intersection of Washuington/3rd Street will exceed the City of
Sherwood standards in 2014 (AM peak). With 2017 background growth, the intersections of Pine
Street/1st Street (PM peak) and Washington Street/3rd Street (AM peak) will exceed the City of
Sherwood standards. The intersection of Highway 99W/Roy Rogers Drive/Tualatin Road is projected
to exceed the ODOT V/C standard in 2017 (PM peak).

  Future year peak hour factors (PHFs) were adjusted to reflect growth and increased system congestion on Highway 99W
during the AM peak hour, consistent with the ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual. Highway 99W/Meinecke Road was
increased from 0.83 to 0.86 and 0.88 for the year 2014 and the year 2017 projections, respectively. Highway 99W/Edy Road-
Sherwood Boulevard was increased from 0.87 to 0.90 and 0.92 for the year 2014 and the year 2017 projections, respectively.

Table 9 lists the performance at study intersections when site traffic is added to background conditions.
The analysis indicates the intersection of Pine/1st Street will exceed the City of Sherwood LOS
standards (AM and PM peak) as a result of the Phase I (2014) development program. The Phase II
development program will result in the City of Sherwood LOS standard being exceeded at the
intersection of Sherwood Boulevard/3rd Street. Four intersections are deficient in 2014 with the Phase I
development and six intersections are deficient in 2017 with the project build out.

PROJECT IMPACT THRESHOLDS
Washington County traffic impact thresholds (10% ADT on an intersection leg)6 were reviewed to
determine if the proposed project would be required to mitigate capacity issues at Oregon
Street/Tonquin Road or provide safety improvements to address SPIS requirements at Highway
99W/Roy Rogers Road/Tualatin-Sherwood Road. Neither location was found to be impacted by more
than 10% from the proposed project traffic.


SIGNAL WARRANTS
Traffic signal warrants were evaluated during the AM and PM peak hours with project related traffic at
each of the deficient unsignalized study intersections. Traffic signal warrant (3)-peak hour was
evaluated from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)7. The intersections of Pine
Street/1st Street and Oregon Street/Tonquin Road are expected to meet the warrant for traffic signals in
the future. Traffic signal warrant analysis is included in the Appendix.

ALL WAY STOP CONTROL WARRANTS
All way stop control (AWSC) warrants were evaluated during the AM and PM peak hours with project
related traffic at each of the unsignalized two way stop controlled (TWSC) study intersections. None
of the locations require conversion from two way stop control to all way stop control.


TURN LANE REQUIREMENTS
Left turn lane and right turn lane warrants were evaluated at the site access locations. Low speeds (25
mph) on Pine Street and Willamette Street indicate that supplemental left and right turn lanes are not
warranted.


QUEUING ANALYSIS
Queuing analyses were performed to determine the potential for traffic queues on Pine Street to extend
onto the rail with the addition of the proposed development. SimTraffic, a microsimulation analysis
tool, was utilized to predict the 2017 AM and PM peak hour queues at the intersection of 1st Street/ Pine
Street and Pine Street/Proposed Site Access (Columbia Street). Specifically, simulations were used to
examine vehicle queuing for the southbound Pine Street approach of the proposed Columbia/Pine Street
and the northbound Pine Street approach of the 1st Street/Pine Street intersections. The intersection of
SW Pine Street/Proposed Columbia Street was analyzed with two-way stop control as well as all-way
stop control (to be conservative and take into account pedestrian and parking activity in the proposed
retail development). Since the site will likely generate high pedestrian activity levels, 50 pedestrian
crossings during the PM peak hour were assumed for each leg of the Columbia/Pine Street intersection
as a conservative means to analyze queuing levels during heavy pedestrian activity. Ten simulation
iterations were run for each scenario, and each of the 60-minute simulation contained a peak 15-minute
period that included the peak hour factor.
Simulation observations indicated that the southbound 95th-percentile traffic queues at the site access
drive would not extend beyond the railroad crossing. The 95th-percentile queue in the northbound Pine
Street approach to 1st Street/SW Pine Street was projected to be 280 feet during the AM peak hour,
which is just slightly higher than the available 208 feet storage for that approach. Upgrading of the
deficient AWSC at 1st and Pine with a traffic signal would result in reduced queuing. Table 11 lists the
95th-percentile queue and available storage by approach.

SIGHT DISTANCE
Sight distance was evaluated for the site access locations and compared to the County standards. The
posted speed on Pine Street and Willamette Street is 25 mph, corresponding to a required AASHTO
sight distance minimum of 280 ft. The proposed access locations can meet the minimum sight distance
requirements.


SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
Preliminary site plans consider two potential alignments for the Columbia Street/Pine Street
intersection. One configuration would create a traditional four-legged intersection, aligning the
proposed eastern leg of Columbia Street directly across from the existing western approach. However,
this alignment would require additional property acquisition and would create a horizontal curve along
the eastern leg of Columbia Street.
The second potential configuration would offset the Columbia Street approaches, constructing the
eastern leg north of the existing Columbia Street/Pine Street intersection. While such an alignment
would not meet access spacing standards, it avoids some of the turn movement conflicts that can occur
at offset intersections (such as major street left turns). Restricting turn movements at the intersections
could further reduce the potential for turning vehicle conflicts. One method to consider would be to
limit the existing Columbia Street portion west of Pine Street to one-way westbound traffic flow, as
indicated in the preliminary site plan8. Final site design should consider enhanced pedestrian and
bicycle crossings to reduce potential conflicts with motor vehicles that may occur due to the offset
intersection.
For the purposes of limiting the vehicle storage space for a conservative queuing analysis, the second
(offset) Columbia Street configuration will be assumed in this study.
The location and configuration of on-street parking along the proposed new Columbia Street is a
concern for the smooth flow of traffic into the site. It is recommended that parking be prohibited within
100 of Pine Street on the south side to reduce the potential for spillback of entering traffic onto Pine
Street.
Extension of the pedestrian/bicycle circulation system along Pine Street between the railroad and
Willamette Street should be included with the site development. This will provide adequate
connectivity and continuity of the system.

Chapter 4: Recommendations
The additional traffic from the proposed project combined with background growth significantly
impacts the level of service at several of the study intersections. Five of these involve unsignalized
intersections and one involves a signalized intersections on Highway 99W. Two of the unsignalized
intersections (Sherwood Boulevard/Century Drive and Oregon Street/Tonquin Street) currently operate
below the City of Sherwood standards and will deteriorate further as a result of growth in non-site and
site traffic. Both of theses locations have been identified as requiring improvements in the
Transportation System Plan.
To meet City of Sherwood and ODOT standards and optimize safety and circulation for the proposed
project, both on-site and off-site improvement should be required to mitigate the impacts of the
proposed project. The following improvements, based on phased development, should be required:
Mitigations for Existing Deficiencies:
         Implement the City of Sherwood TSP recommends improvements at Sherwood
         Boulevard/Century Drive by relocating the existing signal at Sherwood Boulevard/Langer
         Drive to this adjacent intersection and constructing a median to limit Sherwood
         Boulevard/Langer Drive to right-in/right-out only. This improvement is a significant capital
         improvement to mitigate conditions for side-street movements on Century Drive and may be
         beyond the proportional share of the proposed project. An alternative may be to have the
         development contribute a proportional fee-in-lieu-of for the improvements for later
         implementation by the City.
Mitigations for Year 2014 Background Deficiencies:
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Washington Street/3rd Street to meet City
         performance standards. This could be accomplished by the construction of a south-eastbound
         left turn lane (which would require widening or the removal of some on-street parking).
Mitigation for Phase I of Development (Year 2014):
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Pine Street/1st Street to meet City
         performance standards and mitigate queuing impacts at the Pine Street railroad crossing. This
         could be accomplished by implementing a modified circulation for the downtown streets that
         includes:
             o    Install a diverter for south-westbound on 1st Street at Ash Street or Oak Street to
                  require vehicles travelling towards Pine Street to divert to 2nd Street.
             o    Remove one side of on-street parking Ash Street-2nd Street or Oak Street-2nd Street to
                  provide two 12-foot travel lanes from the diverter to Pine Street. Convert to one-way
                  traffic flow approaching Pine Street for this segment.
             o    Install an all-way stop at Pine Street/2nd Street. Stripe the south-westbound approach of
                  2nd Street to have a left turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane.
             o    Consider installing traffic calming measures on 2nd Street southwest of Pine Street to
                  manage the impact of the added traffic.

         Restrict landscaping, monuments, or other obstructions within sight distance triangles at the
         access points to maintain adequate sight distances.
         Provide an enhanced at-grade pedestrian crossing of Pine Street to facilitate multi-modal
         circulation through the project site (e.g., signing, striping, lighting, a raised crossing, or
         pavement texturing).
         Construct Columbia Street northeast of Pine Street to City Standards and install a sign
         indicating that this roadway will be a through street in the future (connecting to Foundry
         Avenue).
         If the alignment of Columbia Street as a four-leg intersection is determined not to be feasible,
         turn restrictions should be implemented by requiring Columbia Street southwest of Pine Street
         to be one way south-westbound.
         Restrict parking on the southeast side of Columbia Street at a minimum within 100 feet of Pine
         Street (northeast of Pine Street).
Mitigation for Year 2017 Background Deficiencies:
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Hwy 99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road to
         meet ODOT performance standards. This could be accomplished by the construction of a
         south-westbound right turn lane. This improvement is a significant capital improvement that
         may require right of way acquisition and could be beyond the proportional share of the
         proposed project. As this intersection is identified for improvement in the Metro 2035
         Financially Constrained RTP as part of the Tualatin-Sherwood Road widening, an alternative
         may be to have the development contribute a proportional fee-in-lieu-of for the improvements
         for later implementation by Washington County/ODOT.
Mitigations for Phase II of Development (Year 2017):
         Construct improvements to improve the operations of Sherwood Boulevard/Pine Street/3rd
         Street to meet City performance standards. This could be accomplished by construction of a
         south-eastbound right turn lane, which may only require restriping and not roadway widening.
         The Adams Avenue South extension (from Tualatin-Sherwood Road to Oregon Street), which
         is a planned City CIP project and required mitigation of another development, would need to be
         in place for the intersection of 1st Street/Pine Street and 3rd Street/Pine Street to meet City
         performance standards under the year 2017 with the proposed project Phase II traffic. Phase II
         of the development should not proceed without this improvement being in place, or additional
         roadway improvement may be required to manage intersection operations and vehicle queuing
         towards the Pine Street railroad crossing.

TRAFFIC LEVELS OF SERVICE
Analysis of traffic volumes is useful in understanding the general nature of traffic in an area, but by itself
indicates neither the ability of the street network to carry additional traffic nor the quality of service
afforded by the street facilities. For this, the concept of level of service has been developed to subjectively
describe traffic performance. Level of service can be measured at intersections and along key roadway
segments.

Level of service categories are similar to report card ratings for traffic performance. Intersections are
typically the controlling bottlenecks of traffic flow and the ability of a roadway system to carry traffic
efficiently is generally diminished in their vicinities. Levels of Service A, B and C indicate conditions
where traffic moves without significant delays over periods of peak travel demand. Level of service D and
E are progressively worse peak hour operating conditions and F conditions represent where demand
exceeds the capacity of an intersection. Most urban communities set level of service D as the minimum
acceptable level of service for peak hour operation and plan for level of service C or better for all other
times of the day. The Highway Capacity Manual provides level of service calculation methodology for
both intersections and arterials. 1 The following three sections provide interpretations of the analysis
approaches.

ALL-WAY STOP CONTROLLED INTERSECTIONS

Unsignalized intersections and all-way stop controlled intersections are each subject to a separate capacity
analysis methodology. All-way stop controlled intersection operations are reported by leg of the
intersection.

This method calculates a delay value for each approach to the intersection. The 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual describes the detailed methodology. The following table describes the amount of delay associated
with each level of service.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS (Two-Way Stop Controlled)

Unsignalized intersection level of service is reported for the major street and minor street (generally, left
turn movements). The method assesses available and critical gaps in the traffic stream which make it
possible for side street traffic to enter the main street flow. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual describes
the detailed methodology. It is not unusual for an intersection to experience level of service E or F
conditions for the minor street left turn movement. It should be understood that, often, a poor level of
service is experienced by only a few vehicles and the intersection as a whole operates acceptably.

Unsignalized intersection levels of service are described in the following table.

Level of Service Expected Delay                            (Sec/Veh)

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

For signalized intersections, level of service is evaluated based upon average vehicle delay experienced by
vehicles entering an intersection. Control delay (or signal delay) includes initial deceleration delay, queue
move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. In previous versions of this chapter of the HCM
(1994 and earlier), delay included only stopped delay. As delay increases, the level of service decreases.
Calculations for signalized and unsignalized intersections are different due to the variation in traffic
control. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual provides the basis for these calculations.


      Level of  Delay
      Service   (secs.)                     Description
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────
        A       <10.00        Free Flow/Insignificant Delays: No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic and no vehicle waits
                              longer than one red indication. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Progression is extremely favorable and
                              most vehicles arrive during the green phase.

         B          10.1-20.0          Stable Operation/Minimal Delays: An occasional approach phase is fully utilized. Many drivers begin
                                       to feel somewhat restricted within platoons of vehicles. This level generally occurs with good progression,
                                       short cycle lengths, or both.

         C          20.1-35.0          Stable Operation/Acceptable Delays: Major approach phases fully utilized. Most drivers feel somewhat
                                       restricted. Higher delays may result from fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle
                                       failures may begin to appear at this level, and the number of vehicles stopping is significant.

         D          35.1-55.0          Approaching Unstable/Tolerable Delays: The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable.
                                       Drivers may have to wait through more than one red signal indication. Longer delays may result from
                                       some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high v/c ratios. The proportion of
                                       vehicles not stopping declines, and individual cycle failures are noticeable.

         E          55.1-80.0          Unstable Operation/Significant Delays: Volumes at or near capacity. Vehicles may wait though several
                                       signal cycles. Long queues form upstream from intersection. These high delay values generally indicate
                                       poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are a frequent
                                       occurrence.

         F          >80.0              Forced Flow/Excessive Delays: Represents jammed conditions. Queues may block upstream
                                       intersections. This level occurs when arrival flow rates exceed intersection capacity, and is considered to
                                       be unacceptable to most drivers. Poor progression, long cycle lengths, and v/c ratios approaching 1.0 may
                                       contribute to these high delay levels.

I.      General Information
Request
DJ2 Holdings, LLC is requesting approval of a Type III Comprehensive Plan Amendment and Zone Change
from Low Density Residential/R-1 to High Density Residential/R-3 for 5.94 acres on Taxlot 3217BC 00800
(the property is bifurcated by the railroad tracks; the parent parcel contains 5.91 acres). This written
narrative, together with preliminary plans and other documentation included in the application materials,
establishes that the application is in compliance with all applicable approval criteria. This documentation
represents substantial evidence and provides the basis for the Planning Commission and City Council to
approve the application.


Project Description
Ultimately, DJ2 Holdings, LLC plans to build an apartment complex on the Martell Commons property. A
concept sketch has been included in Exhibit A, although this application is only for the Comprehensive
Plan Amendment and Zone Change at this time. If approved, the Applicant will then submit a
Development Review application for the final site design.

The Applicant met with surrounding property owners in December 2014 to discuss the land use proposal.
Similar concept sketches were shared, as well as example building elevations. Key areas of concern were
traffic impacts, the number of units proposed, and adequate parking. Based on feedback from that
meeting the Applicant has revised the conceptual plan to reduce the number of units, increase the number
of parking spaces per dwelling unit, and reduced the number of buildings along the western property line.

From a land use perspective, Yamhill County projects a growth rate for Newberg of approximately three
percent per year over the next 15 years. As shown in a Housing Needs Analysis prepared by Cogan Owens
Green (Exhibit G), the land available for residential development within the Newberg Urban Growth
Boundary is not sufficient to accommodate this expected growth. Newberg lacks enough land in the LDR,
MDR, and HDR designations. Proportionately, Newberg only has current capacity to accommodate 89%
of the projected LDR need, 34% of the projected MDR need, and only 13% of the projected HDR need.

Changing the Martell Commons property from LDR to MDR will allow for more efficient use of the limited
land available within the Urban Growth Boundary, but will also provide more diverse housing
opportunities particularly north of the railroad tracks. The only significant vacant R-3 land available is
located at 108 Springbrook Road near Springbrook Oaks, and a small 1.3 acre parcel at 601 Blaine Street.

Site Description
Martell Commons (TL 3217BC 00800) is located on the west side of Villa Road and north of the George
Fox campus and railroad tracks, although the property is bifurcated by the railroad tracks creating a small
remnant parcel south of the railroad tracks; there are no development plans for this tiny parcel. The
parent parcel currently contains a small farm and house. This site has remained in farm production as the
neighborhoods around it have developed to urban densities.
Land to the north has been developed into single family detached homes with primarily R-2 zoning and a
small stretch of R-1 adjacent to Villa Road. East of Villa Road there are three homes that front onto Villa
Road that are zoned R-1. South of those homes, Hess Creek flows under Villa Road and the railroad tracks.
This corridor is zoned Industrial, but is not developable due to the creek. West of Martell Commons are
existing single family detached homes in an R-1 zone. To the southwest, a row of duplex homes back up

to the railroad tracks with a zone of R-2. The site is bounded to the south by the railroad tracks and a
trestle where the tracks cross over Villa Road. South of the railroad is the George Fox campus and
associated sports fields.
The site slopes down from the northwest generally to the southeast, ultimately draining into Hess Creek.
Slopes are generally four to five percent for most of the site, increasing to ten to twelve percent along the
southern edge.

TRANSPORTATION
Villa Road is classified as a major collector. The planned right-of-way width is 30 feet from centerline.
Existing right-of-way is 20 feet from centerline so a ten foot dedication is expected. Park Street is classified
as a local street with a planned full right-of-way width of 60 feet. The existing right-of-way is abutting the
centerline, so 30 feet of dedication is expected.

Chapter 15.302 DISTRICTS AND THEIR AMENDMENT
               15.302.030        Procedures for comprehensive plan map and zoning map amendments.
                                 This section describes the procedures and criteria that apply to any
                                 application to amend the land use designations identified on the
                                 comprehensive plan map, zoning map and land use regulations.
                            A.   Type III Plan and Zoning Map Amendments – One Parcel or Small Group of
                                 Parcels.
                                    1.    Property owners or the city may initiate a map amendment for one
                                          parcel or a small group of parcels under the Type III procedure. May
                                          be initiated by a resolution of the planning commission or city
                                          council. Unlike other Type III procedures, the decision of the
                                          planning commission on a Type III plan map amendment shall be
                                          in the form of a recommendation to the city council. The city council
                                          shall hold another new hearing and make a final decision.
Response:      The Applicant, DJ2 Holdings LLC, proposes a Comprehensive Plan Amendment and Zone
               Change for one parcel, Taxlot 3217BC 00800. This will be reviewed as a Type III
               application reviewed by the Planning Commission with a recommendation to City Council
               for a final decision.

                                    2.    Where an application has been denied, no new application for the
                                          same purpose shall be filed within one year of the date of the previous
                                          denial unless the city council for good cause shall grant permission
                                          to do so.
                                    3.    Amendment Criteria. The owner must demonstrate compliance with
                                          the following criteria:
                                         a.   The proposed change is consistent with and promotes the goals
                                              and policies of the Newberg comprehensive plan and this code;
Response:      The goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan are addressed in detail later in this
               narrative. Overall, the proposed Plan and Zoning Map amendments promote the efficient
               use of limited land within the Urban Growth Boundary, improve housing diversity in this
               area of Newberg, provide affordable multi-family housing close to employment and urban
               services, and located along a major collector. These all match the goals and policies
               outlined in the Comprehensive Plan.

                                         b.   Public facilities and services are or can be reasonably made
                                              available to support the uses allowed by the proposed change;

            Martell Commons – City of Newberg                                                            Page 8
Response:      Exhibit D includes an Infrastructure Analysis for the proposed Comprehensive Plan
               Amendment and Zone Change. This memo reviews the existing infrastructure for
               domestic water, sanitary sewer, and storm drainage. It then reviews the impact that the
               potential 147 dwelling units will have on the existing infrastructure, and identifies any
               mitigation necessary to accommodate this additional impact. In addition, the memo
               outlines the expected transportation improvements necessary for development based
               upon City Standards, the Transportation System Plan, and recommendations from the
               Traffic Impact Analysis in Exhibit F. In summary, the water, sewer, and storm drainage
               facilities have sufficient capacity to accommodate development of Martell Commons.
               Expected transportation improvements include half street widening for Villa Road
               including the addition of a bike lane and sidewalks, widening Park Lane to provide a curb
               to curb width of 32 feet including a dedicated left turn lane and sidewalk along the project
               frontage.

                                        c.   Compliance with the State Transportation Planning Rule (OAR
                                             660-012-0060) for proposals that significantly affect
                                             transportation facilities.
Response:      A full Transportation Impact Analysis is provided in Exhibit F; this report specifically
               addresses the Transportation Planning Rule OAR 660-12-0060. The proposed zone
               change does not require or result in any changes to the functional classification of any
               transportation facility in the vicinity of the site or to the standards that implement the
               functional classification system. The Villa Road/Fulton Street and Villa Road/OR 99W
               intersections are already forecast to miss performance standards under 2035 background
               conditions, even without the proposed rezone. Mitigation for the Villa/Fulton
               intersection include installation of an all-way stop control. This improvement will
               enhance intersection operations from LOS “F” to LOS “E” during the 2035 weekday p.m.
               peak hour. This represents an improvement to level of service than under 2035
               background traffic conditions.

               Action 1F.5 of the Oregon Highway Plan states that small increases in traffic, up to 400
               ADT, do not cause “further degradation” of state highway facilities. Although the
               proposed zone change could generate an additional 795 daily trips over current zoning
               potential, less than 400 of these trips are anticipated to reach the Villa Road/OR 99W
               intersection.

               Finally, Action 1F.5 allows for capacity increasing improvements that include system
               connectivity improvements (for vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians) and multi-modal
               opportunities to reduce vehicle demand. The pedestrian and bicycle improvements
               proposed with the development along Villa Road and the completion of a continuous
               pedestrian route from the rezone site to George Fox University will sufficiently mitigate
               the small increase in v/c ratio forecast the Villa Road/OR 99W intersection.

                                   4.    The property owner who desired to have their property reclassified
                                         has the burden of establishing that the requested classification meets
                                         the requirements of this section. As part of the application, the
                                         property owner requesting a change shall file a waiver stating that the
                                         owner will not file any demand against the city under Ballot Measure
                                         49, approved November 6, 2007, that amended ORS Chapters 195 and
                                         197.

            Martell Commons – City of Newberg                                                           Page 9
Response:      The amendment criteria have been addressed above and throughout this narrative. The
               property owner will sign a waiver on City forms.

                                    5.   A traffic study shall be submitted for any proposed change that would
                                         significantly affect a transportation facility, or that would allow uses
                                         that would increase trip generation in excess of 40 trips per p.m. peak
                                         hour. This requirement may be waived by the director when a
                                         determination is made that a previous traffic study adequately
                                         addresses the proposal and/or when off-site and frontage
                                         improvements have already been completed, which adequately
                                         mitigate any traffic impacts and/or the proposed use is not in a
                                         location, which is adjacent to an intersection, which is functioning at
                                         a poor level of service. A traffic study may be required by the director
                                         for changes in areas below 40 trips per p.m. peak hour where the use
                                         is located immediately adjacent to an intersection functioning at a
                                         poor level of service. The traffic study shall be conducted according
                                         to the City of Newberg design standards.
Response:      A full Traffic Impact Analysis has been included in Exhibit F. This report studied both the
               impact of the proposed zone change on the 2035 performance of the planned
               transportation system, as well as the short term build out impacts of the proposed
               apartment complex on the existing roadway system, and listed necessary mitigation
               measures to ensure there is not a significant degradation of the Newberg transportation
               system.

               15.302.032        Purposes of each zoning district.
                            A.   R-1 Low Density Residential District.
                                    1.   The purpose of this land use designation is to provide for low density
                                         urban single-family residential uses at an average overall density of
                                         4.4 units per gross buildable acre in the district. It is intended to
                                         provide a stable and healthful environment together with the full
                                         range of urban services.
                                    2.   Typical housing types will include single-family dwellings and
                                         planned unit developments. The district also is intended to allow low
                                         intensity institutional uses that operate consistent with peaceful
                                         enjoyment of residential neighborhoods. The R-1 district is intended
                                         to be consistent with the low density residential (LDR) designation
                                         of the comprehensive plan.
                            C.   R-3 High Density Residential District.
                                    1.   The purpose of this land use designation is to provide multifamily
                                         dwellings of different types and styles at an average overall density of
                                         16.5 units per gross buildable acre in the district.
                                    2.   Typical housing types will include duplexes, multifamily dwellings,
                                         and manufactured dwelling and mobile home parks. The district also
                                         is intended to allow low intensity institutional uses that operate
                                         consistent with peaceful enjoyment of residential neighborhoods.
                                         Density may vary depending on lot size, off-street parking area,
                                         transportation, landscaping and other site considerations. The R-3
                                         district is intended to be consistent with the high density residential
                                         (HDR) designation of the comprehensive plan.
Response:      If this application is approved, DJ2 Holdings will submit for Site Plan Review for an
               apartment complex based on the Concept Sketch in Exhibit A. The land use review will

            Martell Commons – City of Newberg                                                          Page 10
             consider parking, intensity, landscaping, buffering, and transportation impacts. The
             Concept Plan has been revised based on neighborhood feedback to reduce the number
             of dwelling units, increase the number of parking spaces per dwelling unit, and reduce
             the number of structures adjacent to existing homes along the western property line.

             An R-3 designation is appropriate in this location due to several factors. The size of the
             property allows for thoughtful site planning, with two story structures along the western
             boundary, and significant separation from the western property line for buffering. The
             location is within walking and biking distance to George Fox University. Joan Austin
             Elementary School is within a half mile, A-dec is within three fourths of a mile, and within
             a quarter mile of the Chehalem Aquatic & Fitness Center, and within three fourths of a
             mile of Highway 99W. It is located along a major collector street, Villa Road. Villa is
             planned for bike lanes for convenient alternative connections to community services
             listed above, including education, employment, services, and recreation.



Chapter 15.305 ZONING USE TABLE
             15.305.010          Classification of uses.
                                 The zoning use table under NMC 15.305.020 identifies the land uses that are
                                 allowed in the various zoning districts. The specific land use categories are
                                 described in Chapter 15.303 NMC. The table identifies each use as one of the
                                 following:
                           P     Permitted Use. The use is a permitted use within the zone. Note that the use
                                 still may require design review, building permits, or other approval in order
                                 to operate.

Chapter 15.405 LOT REQUIREMENTS
               15.405.010           Lot area – Lot areas per dwelling unit.
                             A.     In the following districts, each lot or development site shall have an area as
                                    shown below except as otherwise permitted by this code:
                                       1.   In the R-1 district, each lot or development site shall have a minimum
                                            area of 5,000 square feet or as may be established by a subdistrict.
                                            The average size of lots in a subdivision intended for single-family
                                            development shall not exceed 10,000 square feet.
                                       2.   In the R-2, R-3, and RP districts, each lot or development site shall
                                            have a minimum area of 3,000 square feet or as may be established
                                            by a subdistrict. In the R-2 and R-P districts, the average size of lots
                                            in a subdivision intended for single-family development shall not
                                            exceed 5,000 square feet.
Response:      The Martell Commons site contains 5.94 acres, well above the minimum lot size of 3,000
               square feet of this section. This criterion is met.

                             B.     Lot or Development Site Area per Dwelling Unit.
                                       1.   In the R-1 district, there shall be a minimum of 5,000 square feet per
                                            dwelling unit.
                                       2.   In the R-2, AR, and R-P districts, there shall be a minimum of 3,000
                                            square feet of lot or development site area per dwelling unit. In the


            Comprehensive Plan Amendment and Zone Change Application                                       april 2015
            Martell Commons – City of Newberg                                                                Page 12
                                          R-2 and R-P districts, lots or development sites in excess of 15,000
                                          square feet used for multiple single-family, duplex or multifamily
                                          dwellings shall be developed at a minimum of one dwelling per 5,000
                                          square feet lot area.
                                    3.    In the R-3 district, there shall be a minimum of 1,500 square feet of
                                          lot or development site area per dwelling unit. Lots or development
                                          sites in excess of 15,000 square feet used for multiple single-family,
                                          duplex or multifamily dwellings shall be developed at a minimum of
                                          one dwelling per 2,500 square feet lot area.
Response:      The site contains 5.94 acres, or 258,746 square feet. Assuming that the net site area after
               right-of-way dedications will be approximately 85% of the gross area, there would be an
               approximate net site area of 219,934 square feet. This would allow an approximate
               maximum density of 147 dwelling units and a minimum of 88 dwelling units. The actual
               site density will depend on final site design and will be limited by a balance with available
               parking but is expected to be close to 128 units as described in the Transportation
               Analysis.

                            C.   In calculating lot area for this section, lot area does not include land within
                                 public or private streets. In calculating lot area for maximum lot
                                 area/minimum density requirements, lot area does not include land within
                                 stream corridors, land reserved for public parks or open spaces, commons
                                 buildings, land for preservation of natural, scenic, or historic resources, land
                                 on slopes exceeding 15 percent or for avoidance of identified natural hazards,
                                 land in shared access easements, public walkways, or entirely used for
                                 utilities, land held in reserve in accordance with a future development plan,
                                 or land for uses not appurtenant to the residence.
                            D.   Lot size averaging is allowed for any subdivision. Some lots may be under the
                                 minimum lot size required in the zone where the subdivision is located, as
                                 long as the average size of all lots is at least the minimum lot size.
Response:      Final net site area calculations will be provided for Site Design Review once a final design
               is proposed.

               15.405.030        Lot dimensions and frontage.
                            A.   Width. Widths of lots shall conform to the standards of this code.
                            B.   Depth to Width Ratio. Each lot and parcel shall have an average depth
                                 between the front and rear lines of not more than two and one-half times the
                                 average width between the side lines. Depths of lots shall conform to the
                                 standards of this code. Development of lots under 15,000 square feet are
                                 exempt from the lot depth to width ratio requirement.
                            C.   Area. Lot sizes shall conform to standards set forth in this code. Lot area
                                 calculations shall not include area contained in public or private streets as
                                 defined by this code.
                            D.   Frontage.
                                    1.    No lot or development site shall have less than the following lot
                                          frontage standards:
                                         a.   Each lot or development site shall have either frontage on a
                                              public street for a distance of at least 25 feet or have access to a
                                              public street through an easement that is at least 25 feet wide.
                                              No new private streets, as defined in NMC 15.05.030, shall be
                                              created to provide frontage or access.

                                         b.   Each lot in an R-2 and R-3 zone shall have a minimum width of
                                              30 feet at the front building line.
                                         c.   Each lot in an R-1, AI, or RP zone shall have a minimum width
                                              of 50 feet at the front building line.
                                         d.   Each lot in an AR zone shall have a minimum width of 45 feet at
                                              the front building line.
                                    2.    The above standards apply with the following exceptions:
                                         a.   Legally created lots of record in existence prior to the effective
                                              date of the ordinance codified in this code.
                                         b.   Lots or development sites which, as a process of their creation,
                                              were approved with sub-standard widths in accordance with
                                              provisions of this code.
                                         c.   Existing private streets may not be used for new dwelling units,
                                              except private streets that were created prior to March 1, 1999,
                                              including paving to fire access roads standards and installation
                                              of necessary utilities, and private streets allowed in the airport
                                              residential and airport industrial districts.
Response:      The Martell Commons site has a width of approximately 384 feet which exceeds the
               minimum of 30 feet for the proposed R-3 zone. This criterion is met.

               15.405.040        Lot coverage and parking coverage requirements.
                            A.   Purpose. The lot coverage and parking coverage requirements below are
                                 intended to:
                                    1.    Limit the amount of impervious surface and storm drain runoff on
                                          residential lots.
                                    2.    Provide open space and recreational space on the same lot for
                                          occupants of that lot.
                                    3.    Limit the bulk of residential development to that appropriate in the
                                          applicable zone.
                            B.   Residential uses in residential zones shall meet the following maximum lot
                                 coverage and parking coverage standards. See the definitions in NMC
                                 15.05.030 and Appendix A, Figure 4.
                                    1.    Maximum Lot Coverage.
                                         a. R-1: 30 percent, or 40 percent if all structures on the lot are one-story.
                                         b. R-2 and RP: 50 percent.
                                         c. AR and R-3: 50 percent.
                                    2.    Maximum Parking Coverage. R-1, R-2, R-3, and RP: 30 percent.

Newberg Comprehensive Plan
II.   GOALS AND POLICIES
               The following goals and policies are important elements in the Comprehensive Plan. These
                   statements indicate the intent of the Plan and establish directions for future planning
                   decisions and activities.
      A.       CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT
               GOAL: To maintain a Citizen Involvement Program that offers citizens the opportunity for
                  involvement in all phases of the planning process.
Response:      A voluntary neighborhood meeting was held on December 16, 2014 at the Newberg
               Christian Church. Notice was sent to all property owners within 500 feet of the property.
               The meeting was very well attended. As noted previously, the primary concerns appeared
               to be transportation impacts, number of dwelling units, sufficient parking, and
               architectural design. The Applicant has already modified the conceptual plan to reduce
               the proposed number of units, increase the parking ratio, reduce the number of buildings
               along the western boundary, and change the color palette of the structures to earth
               tones. The public will also have the opportunity to participate in the Planning Commission
               hearing as well as the City Council hearing. Public notice will be provided for each of those
               hearings as well as a notice of decision for all who participate.

      I.       HOUSING
               GOAL: To provide for diversity in the type, density and location of housing within the City to
                  ensure there is an adequate supply of affordable housing units to meet the needs of City
                  residents of various income levels.
               POLICIES:
                           2.   Location Policies
                                   a.   Medium and high density areas should be located for immediate
                                        access to collector streets or minor arterials and should not cause
                                        traffic to move through low density areas. High density areas should
                                        be easily accessible to arterial streets. They should also be located
                                        near commercial services and public open spaces.
Response:      As noted before, an R-3 designation is appropriate in this location due to several factors.
               The size of the property allows for thoughtful site planning, with two story structures
               along the western boundary, and significant separation from the western property line
               for buffering. The location is within walking and biking distance to George Fox University.
               Joan Austin Elementary school is within a half mile, A-Dec is within three fourths of a mile,
               and within a quarter mile of the Chehalem Aquatic & Fitness Center, and within three
               fourths of a mile of Highway 99W. It is located along a major collector street, Villa Road.
               Villa is planned for bike lanes for convenient alternative connections to community
               services listed above, including education, employment, services, and recreation.

                           3.   Mix Policies
                                        AFFORDABLE HOUSING means a dwelling unit that provides
                                        housing for a family or individual(s) with a household income less
                                        than the median household income for the Newberg area, such that
                                        a household pays no more than 30 percent of its annual income on
                                        housing (rent/mortgage, utilities, property taxes). Affordable
                                        housing may include a care home for low-income individuals.

            Martell Commons – City of Newberg                                                      Page 15
                                       Affordability can be assured through deed-restriction or other
                                       recorded documents that specify qualifying income of buyers or
                                       renters, and limiting sales price, rent levels and appreciation.
                                       Affordable housing may also include small, market-rate dwelling
                                       units (e.g., studios, apartments and accessory dwelling units).
Response:      Martell Commons will not be an Affordable Housing project as defined by this Plan policy,
               but it will provide an affordable housing option for many residents of Newberg located
               close to employment, services, and educational uses. The proposed units will be a
               combination of one, two, and three bedroom units with efficient internal layouts that
               allows for a lower overall rental rate. With the close proximity of George Fox University,
               students are an identified tenant profile that is sensitive to rental rates.

                                  b.   Low and moderate income housing should not be concentrated
                                       within particular areas of the City.
Response:      This area of Newberg does not contain a large concentration of low and moderate income
               housing. There is a new Affordable Housing project called Deskin Commons to the west
               on Meridian Street just north of the railroad tracks. Most other R-3/apartment lands
               (moderate income housing) are located south of the railroad tracks. Approval of this
               amendment would provide family wage housing opportunities close to the A-Dec
               employment area as well as near George Fox University.

                                  k.   The City shall encourage an adequate supply of rental housing
                                       dispersed throughout the City to meet the needs of renters.
Response:      Again, this area of Newberg does not contain a large concentration of low and moderate
               income housing. There is a new Affordable Housing project called Deskin Commons to
               the west on Meridian Street just north of the railroad tracks. Most other R-3/apartment
               lands are located south of the railroad tracks. Approval of this amendment would provide
               family wage housing opportunities close to the A-Dec employment area as well as near
               George Fox University.

                                  o.   The City has adopted a comprehensive approach to meeting local
                                       housing needs that balances density, design, and flexibility in code
                                       standards and procedures. The City shall use development incentives
                                       such as density bonuses, flexible development standards, and
                                       streamlined review procedures to stimulate or require the production
                                       and preservation of affordable housing. (replaces old policy “o”)
Response:      No density bonuses are requested. The proposed Plan Amendment and Zone Change will
               allow for development of an apartment complex. The proposed density is within the
               typical range for an apartment complex and matches the density of the R-3 zone.

                                  u.   The City shall build understanding and support for affordable
                                       housing through educational forums with residents and employers,
                                       pre-application consultations with developers, and through local
                                       housing studies.
                                  v.   The City shall work with local affordable housing providers in
                                       developing an overall strategy for meeting Newberg’s housing needs.
                                  w.   City resources shall be directed toward assisting public and private
                                       entities in producing and preserving affordable housing throughout
                                       the community.

            Martell Commons – City of Newberg                                                    Page 16
                                   z.    To the extent possible, the City shall zone residential housing near
                                         employment centers.
Response:      The Comprehensive Plan contains many goals and policies in support of affordable
               housing within Newberg. As noted above, this project will not meet the Plan’s definition
               of affordable housing with specific rent and income limits, it will provide an affordable
               housing opportunity for the residents of Newberg. This property will also improve the
               diversity of housing opportunities near the A-dec employment district.

      K.       TRANSPORTATION
               GOAL 3: Promote reliance on multiple modes of transportation and reduce reliance on the
                  automobile.
               POLICIES:
                                   b.    Modifications should be made to the City's land use plan and
                                         development ordinances that will decrease trip length and encourage
                                         non-auto oriented development.
                                        2)   The City shall encourage higher density development in
                                             residential areas near transit corridors, commercial areas and
                                             employment centers, including the downtown.
Response:      This proposed R-3 site is within walking and biking distance to George Fox University. Joan
               Austin Elementary school is within a half mile, A-Dec is within three fourths of a mile, and
               within a quarter mile of the Chehalem Aquatic & Fitness Center, and within three fourths
               of a mile of Highway 99W. It is located along a major collector street, Villa Road. Villa is
               planned for bike lanes for convenient alternative connections to community services
               listed above, including education, employment, services, and recreation.

               GOAL 4: Minimize the impact of regional traffic on the local transportation system.
               POLICIES:
                                   k.    For the purposes of compliance with the Transportation Planning
                                         Rule, OAR 660-12-0060 and in order to support the goal exception
                                         that Yamhill County took to advance construction of the Bypass, the
                                         City of Newberg acknowledges that reliance upon the Bypass as a
                                         planned improvement to support comprehensive plan amendments
                                         or zone changes is premature.
                                         In accordance with OAR 660-012-0060, the Bypass will be considered
                                         a planned improvement that is reasonably likely to be constructed
                                         during the 20-year planning horizon when the OTP includes all or a
                                         specific phase of the Bypass in the construction section of the
                                         Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), or when
                                         ODOT provides a written statement that the improvements are
                                         reasonably likely to be provided by the end of the planning period.
                                         ODOT expects to provide such a letter upon receiving a record of
                                         decision for the design level EIS if it results in a record of decision
                                         authorizing a full Bypass or a specific Bypass phase that can be
                                         funded within the 20-year planning horizon. During the period before
                                         the Bypass can be considered a planned improvement, the City of
                                         Newberg will work with ODOT to pursue interim measures to
                                         comply with OAR 660-12-0060. This may include adopting alternative
                                         mobility standards for Oregon 99W and Oregon 219. For purposes of
                                         the Newberg TSP, alternative mobility standards are consistent with
                                         the planned function of Oregon 99W through Newberg as a lower
                                         speed local arterial intended to provide access to businesses and

                                        residences and a more pedestrian friendly environment. Alternative
                                        mobility standards may continue to be necessary on Oregon 99W and
                                        Oregon 219 until the full Bypass can be completed.
Response:      A full Transportation Impact Analysis is provided in Exhibit F; this report specifically
               addresses the Transportation Planning Rule OAR 660-12-0060. The proposed zone
               change does not require or result in any changes to the functional classification of any
               transportation facility in the vicinity of the site or to the standards that implement the
               functional classification system. The Villa Road/Fulton Street and Villa Road/OR 99W
               intersections are already forecast to miss performance standards under 2035 background
               conditions, even without the proposed rezone. Mitigation for the Villa/Fulton
               intersection include installation of an all-way stop control. This improvement will
               enhance intersection operations from LOS “F” to LOS “E” during the 2035 weekday p.m.
               peak hour. This represents an improvement to level of service than under 2035
               background traffic conditions.

               Action 1F.5 of the Oregon Highway Plan states that small increases in traffic, up to 400
               ADT, do not cause “further degradation” of state highway facilities. Although the
               proposed zone change could generate an additional 795 daily trips over current zoning
               potential, less than 400 of these trips are anticipated to reach the Villa Road/OR 99W
               intersection.

               Finally, Action 1F.5 allows for capacity increasing improvements that include system
               connectivity improvements (for vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians) and multi-modal
               opportunities to reduce vehicle demand. The pedestrian and bicycle improvements
               proposed with the development along Villa Road and the completion of a continuous
               pedestrian route from the rezone site to George Fox University will sufficiently mitigate
               the small increase in v/c ratio forecast the Villa Road/OR 99W intersection.


               GOAL 5: Maximize pedestrian, bicycle and other non-motorized travel throughout the City.
               POLICIES:
                                  a.    The City shall provide safe, convenient and well-maintained bicycle
                                        and pedestrian transportation systems that connect neighborhoods
                                        with identified community destinations, such as schools, parks,
                                        neighborhood commercial centers, and employment centers.
                                  b.    Bicycle parking facilities shall be required for all new and improved
                                        commercial, institutional, office, industrial, and multi-family
                                        development.
                                  c.    All new and improved commercial, office, institutional, and multi-
                                        family development shall be conveniently and directly accessible
                                        from the public right-of-way by bicycle and on foot.
                                  d.    Public sidewalks shall be provided along all public street frontages.
                                        Pedestrian traffic shall be separated from automobile traffic
                                        whenever possible.
                                       (1)   Sidewalks should be provided whenever there is development of
                                             abutting properties.
                                       (2)   Sidewalks should be constructed when any new road is
                                             constructed

                                       (3)   When existing roads are widened or improved, sidewalks should
                                             be provided.
                                  h.    On-street bike lanes or parallel bikeways will be provided on all
                                        designated major collector and arterial roadways, and on certain
                                        neighborhood collectors if warranted from a bicycle system
                                        connectivity standpoint.
Response:      A significant appeal of this site for multi-family development is the location along Villa
               Road. Villa is planned for bike lanes to provide for convenient alternative connections to
               community services including education, employment, services, and recreation.
               Development of the site will require frontage improvements along Villa to improve the
               bicycle and pedestrian corridor. On-site bicycle parking will also be required as well as a
               complete interior sidewalk system that connects to both Villa Road and Park Lane. It is
               an important business investment to complete the pedestrian and bicycle connection to
               the George Fox campus to attract student tenants.


               GOAL 7: Minimize the capital improvement and community costs to implement the
                  transportation plan.
               POLICIES:
                                  a.    The Transportation System Plan shall identify short and long term
                                        improvements to the collector/arterial street system, the public
                                        transit system, the pedestrian/bicycle system and the air, rail, water,
                                        and pipeline systems.
                                  b.    The list of improvement projects in the Transportation System Plan
                                        shall guide development of the city's capital improvement plan for
                                        transportation projects.
Response:      The Villa Road corridor is on the City’s Capital Improvement Plan to adjust the engineering
               design to improve the vertical alignment and complete the multi-modal improvements.
               Upon development of Martell Commons, the project will be required to make frontage
               improvements to both Villa Road and Park Lane to match City standards. In addition, the
               project is responsible for System Development Charges (SDC’s) based on the number of
               proposed dwelling units. The Applicant has been in discussions with the City Engineer
               about expanding the physical improvements along Villa Road in exchange for SDC credits.
               This is a best case scenario of maximizing the available financing for immediate
               improvements directly associated with the project. This coordination will continue as the
               project moves through the public review process.

                                  i.    New development and existing development undergoing expansion
                                        or modification shall be designed to accommodate planned long-
                                        term transportation improvement projects in the vicinity of the
                                        development.
Response:      As described below, development of the Martell Commons site will require frontage
               improvements to Villa Road and Park Lane to match City standards.

               GOAL 8: Maintain and enhance the City's image, character and quality of life.
               POLICIES:
                                   d.    The City will encourage development that protects the integrity of
                                         existing neighborhoods, commercial, and industrial areas using the
                                         following design techniques.
                                        1)   New development and new transportation facilities shall be
                                             designed to meet the street classification, design, and access
                                             standards identified in the Transportation System Plan.
Response:      As described below, Villa Road is classified as a Major Collector. A half street right-of-way
               dedication of 30 feet will be required with development, as well as a half street widening
               of 34 feet to curb with a five foot bike lane, a six foot planter strip, and a six foot detached
               sidewalk. No on-street parking is permitted.

               GOAL 9: Create effective circulation and access for the local transportation system.
               POLICIES:
                                   c.    Develop a system of roads that provide for efficient movement of
                                         traffic, considering the general design guidelines below:
                                        4)   Major Collectors. Major collectors serve multi-neighborhood
                                             areas. They are intended to channel traffic from local streets
                                             and/or minor collectors to the arterial street system. A major
                                             collector can also provide access to abutting properties.
                                             •   60 to 80 feet of right-of-way with ten foot public utility
                                                 easements.
                                             •   34 to 46 feet curb to curb cross section.
                                             •   Five-foot bike lanes on both sides of the street.
                                             •   On-street parking is generally not allowed except in the
                                                 downtown and other areas where special circumstances
                                                 warrant. No parking will be allowed within 20 feet of curb
                                                 return.
                                             •   A minimum six-foot planter strip and six-foot sidewalk on
                                                 both sides of the street.
Response:      Villa Road is classified as a Major Collector. A half street right-of-way dedication of 30
               feet will be required with development, as well as a half street widening of 34 feet to curb
               with a five foot bike lane, a six foot planter strip, and a six foot detached sidewalk. No
               on-street parking is permitted.

                                        6)   Local Streets. Local streets provide direct access to adjoining
                                             properties and connect to collector streets. The system design
                                             criteria for local streets include:
                                             •   54-65 feet of right-of-way with 10 foot public utility
                                                 easements.
                                             •   For standard residential streets, standard 32 feet curb to curb
                                                 with parking on both sides.
                                             •   A minimum four and one half foot wide planting strip and
                                                 five foot wide sidewalk on both sides of the street.
                                             •   Where approved, limited residential streets may have
                                                 narrower dimensions

Response:      Park Lane is classified as a Local Street, but the partial improvements do not meet City
               standards. A right-of-way dedication of 30 feet will be required with development, as
               well as a street widening for a total width of 40 feet to allow for an additional northbound
               left turn lane, a five foot planter strip, and a five foot detached sidewalk. On-street
               parking will be permitted on both sides.

      L.       PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
               GOAL: To plan and develop a timely, orderly and efficient arrangement of public facilities and
                  services to serve as a framework for urban development.
               POLICIES:
                           1.   All Facilities & Services Policies
                                   a.    The provision of public facilities and services shall be used as tools
                                         to implement the land use plan and encourage an orderly and
                                         efficient development pattern.
                                   b.    The extension of publicly-owned facilities and services into currently
                                         undeveloped areas shall occur only in accordance with the Public
                                         Facilities and Service Plan.
                                   c.    New public facilities and services shall be designed at levels
                                         consistent with planned densities and designated land uses for the
                                         area.
                                   d.    Services shall be planned to meet anticipated community needs.
                                   e.    Owners of properties which are located on unimproved streets should
                                         be encouraged to develop their streets to City standards.
                                   f.    Maximum efficiency for existing urban facilities and services will be
                                         encouraged through infill of vacant City land.
                                   h.    New residential areas shall have: paved streets, curbs, pedestrian
                                         ways, water, sewer, storm drainage, street lights and underground
                                         utilities.
                           2.   Sewers and Water Policies
                                   a.    All existing development within the City limits will connect to public
                                         sewer and water systems as soon as they become available.
                                   b.    Water systems within the planning area will be designed to provide
                                         an adequate peak flow for fire protection.
                                   c.    Developments with urban densities should be encouraged to locate
                                         within the area which can be serviced by Newberg's present sanitary
                                         sewer system.
Response:      An analysis of the infrastructure capacity for this proposed Comprehensive Plan
               Amendment is included in Exhibit D. The Newberg Water Master Plan shows that all
               property under an elevation of 300 feet can be served by the existing reservoir system.
               This property is at an elevation of 198 at the highest point, and can be served by public
               water. Eight inch waterlines are existing adjacent to the property within Villa Road and
               in Park Lane.

               Storm drainage can be treated on site in a water quality facility and released into Hess
               Creek which abuts the property along the southern boundary.

            Martell Commons – City of Newberg                                                        Page 21
               Sanitary sewer is also immediately adjacent to the Martell site; there is an existing eight
               inch line along the southern boundary of the property and there is a second eight inch
               line in Park Lane. The Newberg Sanitary Sewer Master Plan shows that this area is over
               capacity. The Hess Creek trunk line has high levels of infiltration that have created
               capacity concerns. The City is currently working on an update of the infiltration rates in
               this corridor; the study is expected to be completed in April. This study may show that
               the infiltration rates are different than the adopted master plan, which will affect how
               much capacity is available for the Martell Commons site. If the study shows that there is
               still insufficient capacity, the Site Plan Review application may be conditioned to upsize
               existing downstream sanitary sewer pipes, or seal existing manholes and pipes to reduce
               infiltration rates. This will be studied in detail during Site Plan review after the City’s
               capacity update is completed. No development will be approved without sufficient
               capacity and improvements can be reasonably conditioned on land use decisions.

               Development of infill sites supports the policy of efficient use of existing infrastructure.
               The proposed Plan Amendment maximizes the efficiency of the public investment in
               water and sanitary sewer systems.

      M.       ENERGY
               GOAL: To conserve energy through efficient land use patterns and energy- related policies and
                  ordinances.
               POLICIES:
                           1.   Planning Policies
                                   a.   The City will encourage energy-efficient development patterns. Such
                                        patterns shall include the mixture of compatible land uses and a
                                        compactness of urban development.
Response:      As noted above, Development of infill sites supports the policy of efficient use of existing
               infrastructure. The proposed Plan Amendment maximizes the efficiency of the public
               investment in water and sanitary sewer systems.

      N.       URBANIZATION
               GOALS:
                           1.   To provide for the orderly and efficient transition from rural to urban land
                                uses.
                           2.   To maintain Newberg's identity as a community which is separate from the
                                Portland Metropolitan area.
                           3.   To create a quality living environment through a balanced growth of urban
                                and cultural activities.
               POLICIES:
                           3.   General Policies
                                   a.   In new development areas all utility lines shall be placed
                                        underground. In existing areas an effort will be made to locate power,
                                        telephone, cable television and other utility cables underground over
                                        a period of time.
Response:      All proposed infrastructure will be placed underground. Existing overhead wires along
               Villa Road will be undergrounded with development of the site.

III. PLAN CLASSIFICATIONS
                    For the purpose of evaluating and eventually implementing the proposed Comprehensive
                    Plan, descriptions of land use classifications are essential. Explanations of the map
                    designations are as follows:
               2.   Residential Land Use
                               Residential land is divided into three categories. Density rather than housing
                               type is generally the most important development criteria used to classify
                               residential areas. Manufactured dwelling parks, mobile home parks and
                               manufactured home subdivisions are permitted outright in the medium
                               density residential zone. Manufactured homes on individual single family lots
                               are permitted.
                          The following is a summary of the three residential land use categories:
                          a.   Low Density Residential (LDR)
                                        The objective of this designation is to provide a wide range of
                                        housing types and styles, while allowing for an overall density of up

                                        Typical housing types will include single-family attached and
                                        detached housing. Clustered housing areas within Planned Unit
                                        Developments or condominiums must include adequate open areas
                                        to maintain the low overall density of this classification.
                                        Services shall include improved streets, underground utilities (except
                                        electrical transmission lines), street lighting, sidewalks, and in some
                                        cases, bikeways.
                          c.   High Density Residential (HDR)
                                        The objective of this designation is to provide multi-family housing
                                        of different types while maintaining an overall density of up to 21.8
                                        units to the acre.
                                        Typical housing types include apartments, townhouses, and a variety
                                        of cluster developments. Density may vary depending on lot sizes,
                                        off-street parking and other site constraints.
                                        Services shall include improved streets, underground utilities (except
                                        electric transmission lines), street lighting, sidewalks, and in some
                                        cases, bikeways.

               parking, but will be line with adopted density controls. Full urban infrastructure will be
               required for development, including underground utilities, lighting, and street
               improvements as outlined in Exhibit D.



IV POPULATION GROWTH
      A.       HISTORIC POPULATION
                    Newberg grew over 500 percent from 1960 to 2010. This population growth was due to a
                    variety of factors: regional population growth, expansion of industry and business in the
                    area, proximity to other employment centers, and the high quality of life in the area.

             The Portland State University Population Research Center estimated Newberg’s
             population as of July 1, 2010 to be 22,110. As of July 1, 2011, the Urban Growth Boundary
             has an estimated population of 22,730.


B.      POPULATION PROJECTIONS
             Population projections are the basis of comprehensive land use planning. To maintain a
             high quality of living, the community must plan for its future population. Population
             growth will require sufficient land and services.
             Many of the same factors that have contributed to Newberg’s historic population growth
             will contribute to its future growth: employment opportunities both in Newberg and
             nearby, high quality of life, and regional population growth. Newberg is already
             experiencing a great amount of population growth due to the lack of buildable land within
             the Portland area.
             Portland State University’s Population Research Center developed a future population
             forecast for the Newberg Urban Area. This forecast was adopted by Yamhill County as
             the coordinated population forecast required by state law.
             This forecast is shown in Table III-2.

             This population forecast was used to determine future land needs within the Newberg
             urban area.
V.      LAND NEED AND SUPPLY
        A.   BUILDABLE LAND INVENTORY
                         The Newberg Planning Division prepared an inventory of buildable land in
                         the Newberg UGB in 2004. The buildable land inventory includes vacant and
                         redevelopable land in the existing (2004) UGB. This land base is the starting
                         point for determining how much future growth can be accommodated inside
                         the existing UGB and the size of the unmet land need that must be
                         accommodated through zone changes or UGB expansion. Physical
                         constraints such as steep slopes (greater than 25%) and stream setbacks have
                         been deducted from the parcel size, so the buildable land inventory is based

                              on buildable acres, not total acres. In addition, lands that are under
                              development are not considered buildable. This inventory also does not
                              include land located within the future right-of-way of the proposed Newberg-
                              Dundee Bypass. In November 2004, the Newberg UGB had approximately778
                              acres of buildable land inside the UGB (Table IV-1).

                              In addition, there is approximately 467 acres of buildable land within the
                              Newberg Urban Reserve Area. This area does not have any comprehensive
                              plan district designations assigned.
             B.   HOUSING AND RESIDENTIAL LAND NEEDS
                        1.    Housing Needs.
                                        In order to determine the amount of residential land needed, Newberg
                                         used Johnson Gardner to create a Housing Needs Analysis. That
                                         analysis examined the demographic, housing cost, and household
                                         income data for the City of Newberg to determine the need for
                                         specific housing types: single-family, multi-family, and
                                         manufactured homes. Two adjustments were made to the Johnson
                                         Gardner residential land need analysis:
                                        • Development projects that were in the land use approval process
                                             during the preparation of the needs analysis were subtracted
                                             from the overall 2005-2025 need.
                                        • 49 dwelling units displaced by the proposed Newberg-Dundee
                                             Bypass were added to the housing need.


             The result is the future housing needs projections shown in Table IV-2.

                  The residential land need is determined by assigning each housing type to a
                  comprehensive plan designation – low density residential (LDR), medium density
                  residential (MDR), and high density residential (HDR) (Table IV-3).

                                      dividing the dwelling units needed by the planned residential
                                      densities. The total buildable residential land needs through 2025
                                      2030 and 2040 are shown in Table IV-6.

                                 Comparing the residential land need the current supply, the City has a
                                    deficit of residential land to meet needs through 2025 in all residential
                                    categories. It also has a deficit of land within the URA to meet the

Response:        The housing analysis in the adopted Comprehensive Plan dates from 2004. In 2009,
                 Newberg proposed an update to the Housing Element of the Comprehensive Plan parallel
                 with an effort to add industrial land on the south end of town for future employment
                 growth. That effort has been stalled by appeal with LUBA and now enters into an
                 unprecedented mediation process. In October 2012, the Yamhill County Planning
                 Commission adopted a new coordinated population forecast for the Newberg UGB
                 through 2035 based on 2010 census data as well as a report titled “Population Forecasts
                 for Yamhill County, its Cities and Unincorporated Areas 2011-2035” prepared by Portland
                 State University Population Research Center.

                 Cogan Owens Greene prepared a Housing Needs Analysis (Exhibit G) based on the 2009
                 inventory updated with current GIS data provided by City Staff, the projections from the
                 Portland State Report, and refined for the remand findings from LUBA. This supplemental
                 report is included in Exhibit G. It confirms that there will be a shortage of land available
                 in 2030 for LDR, MDR, and HDR lands:

                Total


               While all lands show a shortage, the greatest percentage shortage is HDR with only seven
               buildable acres within City limits, and the lowest shortage is LDR. It should also be noted
               that the most efficient use of scarce residential land is HDR. The proposed
               Comprehensive Plan Amendment and Zone Change would help preserve as much
               residential opportunity as possible and improve the diversity of housing opportunities.
               While the City works diligently to resolve the UGB stalemate, it is important to understand
               the significant shortage of HDR lands across the City. When the UGB is expanded, there
               is still a need to disperse the available HDR lands throughout the City where there is
               convenient access to employment and services. Martell Commons is an ideal geographic
               location to provide diversity for the housing needs of Newberg, consistent with other
               goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan addressed above.


IV. Conclusion
The listed findings and accompanying documentation demonstrates that the proposal is consistent with
the applicable provisions of the City of Newberg Development Code and Comprehensive Plan. The
applicant respectfully requests approval of the proposed Martell Commons Comprehensive Plan
Amendment and Zone Change Application.

From:              John Howorth, PE

Project Name: Martell Commons
Project No:   14225
RE:           Infrastructure Review


This technical memorandum is being prepared to summarize the current status of the surrounding
infrastructure, the potential impacts associated with the zone change, and any mitigation of the impacts
that will be required by the City of Newberg. The infrastructure discussed within this memo includes
water, sanitary sewer, and storm water.

Zone Change
The proposed zone change from R-1 to R-3 will allow for an increased density potential for the subject
parcel. The increase in density will increase the use of potable water and subsequently create higher
sanitary sewer flows, as well as increase the number of vehicle trips generated by the project. Storm
water runoff may increase slightly due to the potential to have more impervious area.

Potable Water
Existing Conditions:
The City of Newberg currently has 3 reservoirs, one at Corral Creek, and two at North Valley. Each
reservoir is understood to have a capacity of 4 million gallons each.

Impacts & Mitigation:
The zone change will generate a slight increase in the demand for potable water and fire, but not a
significant impact. It is understood that the existing system is more than capable of handling the added
demand from the zone change and that no additional reservoir capacity is needed.

As part of the final development of the property a fire flow analysis will be performed to determine if any
existing water lines would need to be upsized. Water lines will be extended through the site to provide
both domestic water services and fire hydrants for the development. These extensions will be provided by
the developer.

Storm Water
Existing Conditions:
Currently the site consists of a single family home with a detached garage and two sheds. The site is
predominately vegetated.

Impacts & Mitigation:
The zone change will allow for a more dense development to occur; however this does not typically
correlate to a proportional increase in runoff. Rather, the amount of storm water runoff is directly related
to the amount of impervious surface created with the development.        All storm water will be treated for
water quality before being released into any municipal system. The development will follow City
standards water quality and detention.

Sanitary Sewer
Existing Conditions:
The site abuts a 12-inch public sanitary sewer line that runs along Hess Creek to the south and east of
the property. The current City of Newberg Sewer Master Plan shows capacity for the proposed increased
density associated with the zone change within the public sewer system directly adjacent to the site with
the system flowing under surcharged conditions further downstream.

Impacts & Mitigation:
Development of the subject property under its current R-1 zone would yield a projected sewer demand of
1,225-gpm at the point in which flows would enter the system. The increase in allowed density
associated with a zone change to R-3 could generate a sewer demand of up to 1,242-gpm (assuming low
flow plumbing fixtures and an I/I peaking factor of 3 for new pipe rather than a peaking factor of 4). The
total existing flow in the 12-inch sewer, based on the City’s master plan, is approximately 1,203-gpm.
While the zone change would create a slight increase in sewer flows, the relative increase to the existing
system is only 3.2%, and only 1.4% over the allowed R-1 zoning. This is within the margin of error of the
flow modeling that backstops the City’s Master Plan. The system is currently under review by the City
Engineering department and we anticipate that flow testing will be conducted to confirm the assumptions
used in developing the master plan. At this time there is no indication of any improvements necessary to
the system based on the minimal increases to the sewer flows as a result of the zone change.

Executive Summary




Executive Summary
Per an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) 
and  the  City  of  Keizer  (City),  an  updated  master  plan  that  focuses  specifically  on  Area  "C"  in  the 
larger  Keizer  Station  development  has  been  prepared.  Consistent  with  the  previous  Keizer  Station 
master planning work, the following traffic study analyzed 2020 traffic conditions to ensure that the 
surrounding infrastructure will continue to operate acceptably in the longterm future. 

Based  on  the  results  of  this  study, Area  "C"  can  be  developed  while  maintaining  acceptable  traffic 
operations  and  safety  at  the  study  intersections  within  the  site  vicinity  assuming  provision  of  the 
recommended  mitigation  measures  as  outlined  in  the  table  below.  It  should  be  noted  these  are 
mitigations  to  accommodate  full  development  of  the  site  and  2020  traffic  volumes.  The  timing  of 
development  of  the  site  and  system  traffic  volume  increases  will  determine  when  these 
improvements need to be implemented.

Introduction




Introduction
In  2004,  a  transportation  impact  analysis  (Keizer  Station  Master  Plan,  2004,  {Reference  1})  was 
prepared  for  the  entire  Keizer  Station  development  (Areas  "A",  "B",  "C",  and  "D")  in  Keizer, 
Oregon.  As  a  result  of  that  study  effort,  Areas  "A"  and  "D"  were  formally  approved  for 
development.  In  order  for  future  development  to  occur  in  Area  "C",  an  updated  master  plan  is 
required  per  an  intergovernmental  agreement  (IGA)  between  the  Oregon  Department  of 
Transportation  (ODOT)  and  City  of  Keizer  (additional  details  of  the  IGA  will  be  provided  later  in 
this  report).  This  master  plan  will  ensure  that  the  land  can  be  reasonably  developed  in  a  way  that 
fits  the  site  and  is  consistent  with  the  overall  characteristics  of  the  larger  Keizer  Station 
development.  The  master  plan  refinement  for  Area  "C"  will  lay  out  the  basic  development 
characteristics  and  identify  the  necessary  infrastructure  improvements  needed  to  ultimately 
support future development. 

The general location of the larger Keizer Station development area is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 2 
illustrates  Area  "C"  in  relation  to  the  other  subareas  that  make  up  Keizer  Station.  As  shown  in 
Figure  2,  Area  "C"  is  bisected  by  Chemawa  Road  and  divided  into  two  halves.  The  east  half  is

Existing Conditions
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric 
characteristics  of  the  roadways  within  the  study  area.  These  conditions  will  be  compared  with 
future conditions later in this report. Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried 
the  subarea  site  and  surrounding  study  area. At  those  times,  KAI  collected  information  regarding 
site  conditions,  adjacent  land  uses,  existing  traffic  operations,  and  transportation  facilities  in  the 
study area.

EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS

Existing Traffic Volumes
Seasonally  adjusted  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  turning  movement  volumes  at  all  of  the  study 
intersections  were  conducted  by  ODOT  as  developed  for  the  Chemawa  Road  Interchange  Access 
Management  Plan  (IAMP)  (Reference  2).  Although  the  majority  of  these  counts  were  conducted  in 
2008, it was determined that some of them were still appropriate for use as part of this study effort. 
However,  given  that  there  has  been  some  development  changes  in  Keizer  Station  Area  "A"  since 
2008,  it  was  also  determined  that  updated  traffic  counts  were  necessary  at  the  following 
intersections: 

    ·    Lockhaven Drive/Chemawa Road/Keizer Station Boulevard 
    ·    Chemawa Road/Stadium Drive/Ulali Drive 
    ·    Chemawa Road/Interstate 5 (I5) Southbound (SB) Ramp Terminal 
    ·    Chemawa Road/I5 Northbound (NB) Ramp Terminal 
As  such,  new  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  turning  movement  counts  were  conducted  at  these 
intersections on a July weekday evening (4:00 p.m.  6:00 p.m.).  

Seasonal Adjustment
Per  standard  ODOT  analysis  procedures,  the  traffic  counts  were  investigated  for  adjustment  to  30th 
highest  hour  volumes.  Since  there  are  no  Automatic  Traffic  Recorder (ATR)  stations  located  in  the 
study  area,  the  ODOT  Characteristic  Table  Method  was  used  for  this  analysis.  The  Characteristics 
Table Method procedure involves matching study area roadways with other ATR roadways around 
Oregon  that  have  similar  characteristics  and  utilizing  the  seasonal  adjustment  factors  for  the 
matching  ATR  location.  Consistent  with  the  seasonal  adjustment  procedures  used  as  part  of  the 
Chemawa  Road  IAMP,  an  average  of ATR  stations  26003,  27006,  and  03011  was  used  to  calculate 
the  30th  highest  hour  volume  adjustment  factor  as  summarized  in  Table  2.  Given  that  the 
intersection  turning  movement  counts  were  conducted  in  July  during  the  peak  travel  season,  a 
minimal  season  adjustment  factor  of  1.01  was  applied  to  the  turning  movement  volumes.  As  a 
result,  the  adjusted  and  balanced  turning  movement  counts  are  shown  in  Figure  4.  Appendix  A 
contains the updated traffic count sheets used in this study.

Existing Intersection Operations
All  levelofservice  analyses  described  in  this  report  were  performed  in  accordance  with  the 
procedures  stated  in  the  2000  Highway  Capacity  Manual  using  the  traffic  analysis  program 
Synchro.  A  description  of  level  of  service  and  the  criteria  by  which  they  are  determined  is  presented  in 
Appendix "B". All intersection levelofservice evaluations are based on the peak 15minute flow rate 
during  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour.  Using  the  peak  15minute  flow  rate  ensures  that  this  analysis 
is based on a reasonable worstcase scenario. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are 
only  likely  to  occur  for  15  minutes  out  of  each  average  peak  hour.  The  transportation  system  will 
likely  operate  under  conditions  better  than  those  described  in  this  study  during  all  other  time 
periods. 

Level  of  service  (LOS)  represents  ranges  in  the  average  amount  of  delay  that  motorists  experience 
when  passing  through  the  intersection.  LOS  is  measured  on  an  "A"  (best)  to  "F"  (worst)  scale.  At 
signalized  and  allway  stopcontrolled  intersections  LOS  is based  on  the  average  delay  experienced 
by  all  vehicles  entering  the  intersection.  At  twoway  stopcontrolled  intersections  LOS  is  based  on 
the  average  delay  experienced  by  the  worst  movement  at  the  intersection,  typically  a  leftturn  from 
the  stopcontrolled  street.  For  signalized  intersections  in  the  City  of  Keizer,  LOS  "D"  is  considered 
to  be  the  minimum  acceptable  operational  level.  For  unsignalized  intersections  LOS  "E"  is 
considered to be the minimum acceptable level. 

The  volumetocapacity  (v/c)  ratio  is  a  measure  of  how  close  an  intersection  is  operating  to  its 
theoretical  capacity.  The  City  of  Keizer  maintains  a  v/c  standard  for  arterial/arterial  intersections  as 
the  operation  of  these  intersections  is  critical  to  the  operation  of  the  network  as  a  whole.  Therefore 
an  intersection  of  two  arterial  roadways  must  have  a  v/c  ratio  of  0.95  or  less  to  be  operating 
acceptably.  For  all  other  intersection  types,  only  the  LOS  is  used  for  determining  intersection 
operation.

Existing Conditions


Finally,  the  City  of  Keizer  and  ODOT  have  developed  an  IGA  (Reference  3)  as  part  of  the    2004 
Keizer  Station  master  planning  process  that  outlines  that  a  volumetocapacity  threshold  of  0.87 
plus/minus  2percent  will  be  used  as  the  mobility  standard  for  determining  the  acceptable  or 
unacceptable operation of signalized intersections within the vicinity of the I5 interchange. This v/c 
standard  applies  to  the  Lockhaven  Drive/Chemawa  Road/Keizer  Station  Boulevard,  Chemawa 
Road/Stadium Drive/Ulali Drive, Chemawa Road/I5 SB ramp terminal, and Chemawa Road/I5 NB 
ramp terminal intersections. 

Figure  4  and  Table  3  summarize  the  intersection  operations  analyses  for  the  study  intersections 
under  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  existing  traffic  conditions.  Appendix  "C"  provides  the  existing 
conditions  Synchro  worksheets  and  can  be  referenced  for  detailed  information  related  to  lane  configurations, 
levels of service, and volumetocapacity ratios. 

As shown in Figure 4 and Table 3, only the Chemawa Road / Verda Lane intersection does not meet 
the  applicable  operational  performance  standards.  This  allway  stopcontrolled  intersection  is 
currently  operating  a  LOS  "F"  during  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour.  Recognizing  the  inadequacy  of 
this  intersection,  the  City  of  Keizer  is  in  the  process  of  securing  funding  to  construct  a  roundabout 
per  the  longterm  recommendations  of  the  City's  Transportation  System  Plan. Additional  details  of 
this future improvement project are provided in subsequent sections of this report.

Planned Improvements
The  documents  listed  below  provide  background  on  the  planned  road  improvements  within  the 
site  vicinity.  This  information  is  being  presented  to  demonstrate  that  this  study  is  being  prepared 
consistent  with  previously  identified/planned  infrastructure  improvements.  A  general  description 
of  the  planned  improvement  is  listed  below  in  standard  text  followed  by  a  remark  in  italics  text  on 
how it relates to the Area "C" study effort. 


INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT KEIZER STATION, JANUARY 2008

In  2008,  the  City  and  the  ODOT  entered  into  an  IGA  that  outlined  a  number  of  transportation 
improvement  projects  within  the  I5  interchange  study  area.  Those  projects  that  have  not  already 
been implemented include the following: 

      ·      Construct  dual  westbound  leftturn  lanes  and  dual  eastbound  rightturn  lanes  at  the 
             Chemawa  Road/I5  SB  ramp  terminal  (The  City  of  Keizer  is  in  the  process  of  securing  funding  to 
             implement  these  improvements.  As  will  be  noted  later  in  this  report,  it  is  assumed  that  this  project 
             will be constructed within the next several years). 
      ·      Install  a  50foot  mast  arm  eastbound  on  Chemawa  Road  at  the  I5  NB  ramp  terminal  (The 
             City  of  Keizer  is  in  the  process  of  securing  funding  to  implement  this  improvement.  As  will  be  noted 
             later in this report, it is assumed that this project will be constructed within the next several years). 


KEIZER STATION MASTER PLAN, APRIL 2004

The April 2004 Keizer Station Master  Plan identified a number of improvements to the study vicinity 
that  have  not  yet  been  built.  These  improvements  are  associated  with  the  unbuilt  Area  "C"  of  the 
larger development vision. 

Chemawa Road (south of Lockhaven Drive)
      ·      Widen  Chemawa  Road  to  a  fivelane  cross  section  from  Lockhaven  Drive  to  approximately 
             400  feet  south  of  McLeod  Lane  (These  improvements  are  currently  identified  in  the  Area  "C" 
             development plan 1 ). 
      ·      At the intersection of Lockhaven Drive: 
                   o      Provide  dual  northbound  rightturn  lanes,  a  single  through  lane,  and  a  single  left
                          turn lane (These improvements are currently identified in the Area "C" development plan).

CITY OF KEIZER TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PLAN, APRIL 2009

The  City  of  Keizer's  Transportation  System  Plan  (TSP)  (Reference  4)  has  identified  the  following 
improvement needs in the site vicinity. 

Lockhaven Drive / River Road
    ·    Convert  westbound  approach  to  dual  leftturn  lanes,  single  through  lane,  and  separate 
         rightturn lane  
    ·    Convert the eastwest split phasing to protected leftturn phasing.  
    ·    These  projects  are  identified  as  a  longterm  operational  improvements,  but  they  are  not  specifically 
         associated  with  any  existing  or  planned  development  project.  According  to  City  staff,  there  is  no 
         existing implementation timeframe for these improvements. 

Lockhaven Drive / 14th Avenue
    ·    Construct a westbound rightturn lane. 
    ·    Modify  northbound  and  southbound  approaches  to  include  separate  leftturn  lane  and 
         shared through and rightturn lanes. 
    ·    These  projects  are  identified  as  a  longterm  operational  improvements,  but  they  are  not  specifically 
         associated  with  any  existing  or  planned  development  project.  According  to  City  staff,  there  is  no 
         existing implementation timeframe for these improvements. 

Chemawa Road / Verda Lane
    ·    Convert the allway stopcontrolled intersection to a single lane roundabout. 
    ·    This  project  is  identified  as  a  longterm  operational  improvement.  As  identified  in  the  existing 
         conditions  section  of  this  report,  this  project  is  currently  identified  for  funding  in  the  STPU  project 
         list.  Given  this  funding  source,  City  staff  feels  that  is  reasonably  likely  that  construction  of  a 
         roundabout at this intersection will occur within the 2015 timeframe.

Assumptions and Methodology
This  section  outlines  the  study  assumptions  and  methodologies  used  to  complete  the  Area  "C" 
master plan operations analysis. 


ASSUMPTIONS

The  purpose  of  the  transportation  impact  analysis  is  to  identify  the  impact  of  Area  "C" 
development on the surrounding transportation system. As is common for phased developments of 
this  magnitude,  the  actual  land  uses,  tenants  and  size  of  buildings  may  vary  over  time  as  the 
marketplace  demands  during  the  buildout  of  the  site.  Therefore,  this  transportation  facilities 
analysis  has  been  prepared  using  reasonable  worstcase  assumptions  to  accommodate  future 
market  driven  changes  to  the  development  plan.  The  trip  generation  identified  in  this  study  is 
intended  to  operate  as  a  trip  cap  for  the  development  with  particular  uses  varying  with 
development. 

Land Use Assumptions
According  to  the  allowed  land  uses  within  the  Area  "C"  study  area,  Area  "C"  is  likely  to  develop 
with  a  number  of  different  land  uses  ranging  from  retail  to  office  and  residential  uses.    Based  on 
this  general  guidance,  Table  4  provides  the  land  use  assumptions  for  the  master  plan  and  the  trip 
generation source that will be used for each of the typical land uses.

Trip Type Assumptions
For  the  Area  "C"  trip  generation  development,  the  following  trip  types  and  assumptions  will  be 
utilized. 

Internal Trips
A  portion  of  trips  generated  by  mixeduse  developments  will  travel  between  the  different  uses 
internal  to  the  site.  Area  "B"  has  a  range  of  different  land  uses,  which  are  served  by  internal  road 
systems  and  motorists  will  not  have  to  use  the  external  transportation  system  (i.e.,  Keizer  Station 
Boulevard  and  Lockhaven  Drive)  to  move  between  the  different  land  uses.  The  ITE  Trip  Generation 
Handbook  (Reference  5)  provides  a  summary  of  recent  studies  from  around  the  country  on  trip 
internalization.  These  studies  suggest  a  trip  internalization  rate  in  the  range  of  5  to  15  percent 
would  be  appropriate  for  a  development  like  Keizer  Station.  On  this  basis,  and  internalization  rate 


Kittelson & Associates, Inc.                                                                                19
Keizer Station Area C Master Plan                                                                               October 2010
Assumptions and Methodology


of  10  percent  was  assumed  for  Area  "C"  of  the  Keizer  Station  Plan.  This  is  conservative  and 
consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the area. 

Pass-by Trips
Passby  trips  are  trips  that  are  passing  directly  by  the  generator.  A  visit  to  the  generator  is  an 
intermediate  stop  on  the  way  from  an  origin  to  a  primary  trip  destination  without  requiring  a 
diversion.  Because  no  diversion  is  required,  a  passby  trip  adds  only  turning  movements  to  the 
transportation  system  at  the  siteaccess  driveway.  Passby  trips  occur  on  the  roadways  adjacent  to 
Area  "C";  in  this  case  the  Lockhaven  Drive  and  Chemawa  Road  corridors  would  be  the  primary 
roadways  that  serve  passby  trips.  Based  on  the  ITE  data,  the  average  passby  rate  for  shopping 
centers is 34 percent. Typically the goal is to limit the passby trips along the adjacent facility not to 
exceed  20  percent  of  the  traffic  traveling  along  these  corridors.  (Example:  if  1,000  vehicles  passby  the 
site,  a  maximum  of  20  percent  [or  200]  would  stop  at  the  retail  center.  The  total  passby  trips  would  be  200 
[100  in  and  100  out].)  After  a  review  of  the  current  traffic  volumes  along  the  facilities  during  the 
current weekday p.m. peak hour, only 15 percent of the commercial trips are assumed to be passby 
trips. Again, this is conservative and consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the area. 

Diverted Trips
Diverted  linked  trips  are  trips  made  by  vehicles  that  are  currently  on  the  roadway  system  en  route 
to  a  destination,  but  change  paths  and  travel  some  distance  out  of  direction  to  access  the 
development.  The  trip  to  the  site  is  not  the  primary  trip  for  this  vehicle.  Diverted  linked  trips  add 
traffic  to  streets  adjacent  to  a  site,  but  may  not  add  traffic  to  the  area's  major  travel  routes.  For  this 
study,  I5  would  be  the  primary  roadway  that  serves  diverted  trips.  There  will  be  no  distinction 
between  diverted  and  primary  (net  new)  trips  through  the  study  intersection;  therefore  diverted 
trips are not tracked separate in this study. 


METHODOLOGY

Study Intersections
This  analysis  determines  the  transportationrelated  impacts  associated  with  the  development  in 
Area  "C"  of  the  Keizer  Station  development  and  was  prepared  to  be  consistent  with  previous 
master planning efforts for Areas "A" and "D". As such, operational analyses were performed at the 
following intersections: 

    ·    Lockhaven Drive/River Road (City jurisdiction) 
    ·    Lockhaven Drive/14th Avenue (City jurisdiction) 
    ·    Lockhaven Drive/McLeod Lane (City jurisdiction) 
    ·    Lockhaven Drive/Chemawa Road/Keizer Station Boulevard (City jurisdiction) 
    ·    Chemawa Road/Stadium Drive/Ulali Drive (ODOT jurisdiction)

Assumptions and Methodology


    ·    Chemawa Road/McLeod Lane (City jurisdiction) 
    ·    Chemawa Road/Verda Lane  (City jurisdiction) 

Analysis Period
The  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  was  identified  as  the  critical  time  period.  This  is  the  time  when  the 
combination  of  sitegenerated  traffic  and  surrounding  traffic  volumes  is  greatest.  This  time  period 
is  also  consistent  with  City's  TSP.  In  addition,  ODOT  is  currently  conducting  an  IAMP  for  the  I
5/Chemawa Road interchange and analyzes only the weekday p.m. peak hour. 

Analysis Scenarios
Based  on  conversations  with  the  Keizer  Station  developers  and  City  staff,  it  was  concluded  that  a 
reasonable buildout year for Area "C" (as well as buildout of the rest of Keizer Station) is 2020. This 
time  period  is  in  tune  with  the  current  progression  of  development  occurring  in  Area  "A"  and  is 
consistent with previous master planning efforts for Keizer Station. As such, the study intersections 
will  be  analyzed  under  existing  and  2020  buildout  conditions  with  this  longterm  horizon  year. 
Specific details and assumptions within these time periods are outlined below: 

    ·    2010 Existing Traffic Conditions (discussed previously in Section 3) 
    ·    2020 Background Traffic Conditions 
             o    This  analysis  assumes  a  moderate  amount  of  regional  traffic  growth  through  the 
                  study  area  as  well  as  the  assumed  buildout  of  the  remaining  segments  of  Area  "A" 
                  and Area "D". 
    ·    2020 Total Traffic Conditions 
             o    In  addition  to  the  2020  background  traffic  growth,  this  analysis  assumes  buildout  of 
                  Area "C" as well as Area "B". 

Saturation Flow
The  TPAU Analysis  Procedures  Manual  (Reference  6)  states  that  inside  the  Salem  MPO  urban  growth 
boundaries  an  unadjusted  saturation  flow  rate  of  1,900  pcphgl  may  be  used  unless  one  or  more  of  the 
conditions  listed  below  are  present,  in  which  case  1,750  pcphgl  shall  be  used.  The  City  of  Keizer  falls 
within the Salem MPO.  

    ·    Onstreet parking 
             a. Response:  There  are  no  study  area  roadways  that  have  or  allow  onstreet  parking. 
                Condition not present. 
    ·    Greater than 5% trucks 
             b. Response:  Truck  percentages  along  the  Chemawa  Road/Lockhaven  Drive  corridor 
                are less than 5%. Condition not present. 
    ·    Roadways intersect at severe skew angle

Assumptions and Methodology


             c. Response: Condition not present. 
    ·    One or more driveway approaches within functional area 
             d. Response:  All  of  the  roadways  within  the  critical  interchange  area  are  public  streets 
                and  there  are  no  private  driveways  located  between  major  study  intersections. 
                Therefore, condition not present. 
    ·    Poor signal spacing and observed queue spill back 
             e. Response:  The  five  signalized  intersections  along  the  Chemawa  Road/Lockhaven 
                Drive  corridor  are  equally  spaced  at  approximately  700800  feet.  The  recent 
                improvements  associated  with  the  Area  "A"  development  provided  significant 
                additional  capacity  in  the  vicinity  of  the  I5/Chemawa  Road  interchange.  Therefore, 
                condition not present. 
    ·    Less than 12foot travel lanes 
             f.   Response:  There  are  12foot  travel  lanes  along  the  Chemawa  RoadLockhaven  Drive 
                  corridor  with  the  exception  of  the  approximately  600  feet  over  the  existing 
                  I5/Chemawa  Road  Bridge.  The  leftmost  through  travel  lane  in  both  directions  is  11 
                  feet,  but  the  rightmost  through  and  turn  lanes  are  all  12  feet  to  ensure  that  slower 
                  vehicles, especially trucks have the standard lane width.  
As  part  of  the  approval  of  the  larger  Keizer  Station  development,  all  parties  agreed  that  the  use  of 
1,900  pcphpl  as  the  base  saturation  flow  rate  was  appropriate  to  be  used  on  all  signalized 
approaches.  This  agreement  is  further  supported  by  the  fact  that  the  Highway  Capacity  Manual  and 
the  Synchro  and  SimTraffic  computer  models  all  use  1,900  pcphpl  as  a  recommended  default  value 
in the absence of better data.

2020 BACKGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

As  previously  stated,  there  are  a  number  of  roadway  and  intersection  improvements  planned  for 
the general study area. Based on conversations with City staff, it is assumed for the purposes of this 
study  that  the  following  improvements  will  be  constructed  within  the  2020  study  horizon  year:

             o    This  allway  stopcontrolled  intersection  will  be  converted  to  a  single  lane 
                  roundabout.  Given  this  project  has  a  funding  source,  City  staff  feels  that  is 
                  reasonably  likely  that  construction  of  a  roundabout  at  this  intersection  will  occur 
                  within the 2015 timeframe. 
    ·    Chemawa Road / I5 southbound ramp terminal 
             o    Implement  dual  westbound  rightturn  lanes  and  dual  eastbound  rightturn  lanes. 
                  The  City  of  Keizer  is  currently  securing  funding  to  implement  these  improvements 
                  within the next several years.

YEAR 2020 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Regional Traffic Growth
The  future  traffic  volumes  are  proposed  to  be  developed  by  applying  a  per  year  linear  growth  rate 
to  the  existing  traffic  volumes  (including  the  seasonal  adjustment  factor).  This  growth  rate  is 
consistent  with  that  used  to  update  to  the  City's  TSP.  The  TSP  based  traffic  growth,  in  part,  on 
modeling  conducted  by  the  Salem/Keizer  Area  Transportation  Study  (SKATS),  which  identified 
future  turning  movement  volumes  for  select  intersections  in  the  City. A  summary  of  this  analysis  is 
presented in Table 5.

However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  2031  SCATS  volumes  include  model  assumptions  for  the  full 
buildout  of  Keizer  Station.  Although  it  is  difficult  to  accurately  backout  the  Keizer  Station  specific 
traffic  volumes  from  the  model  output,  the  trip  generation  calculations  outlined  in  subsequent 
sections  of  this  report  imply  that  the  undeveloped  portion  of  Keizer  Station  is  likely  attributing  up 
to  300  trips  along  the  Lockhaven  Drive  corridor.  Accounting  for  this  total,  the  actual  regional 
growth  rate  that  is  not  attributed  to  Keizer  Station  is  likely  less  than  one  percent.  However,  for 
conservative reasons, this study effort has assumed a regional growth rate of 1.0 percent that will be 
applied to the existing traffic volumes. 

Keizer Station In-Process Trip Generation
The  April  2004,  the  Keizer  Station  Master  Plan  Traffic  Impact  Analysis  included  a  formal  trip 
generation  assessment  for  Areas  "A"  and  "D"  that  was  subsequently  approved  by  the  City  of 
Keizer. While Area "A" has since seen a significant amount of commercial development, it has yet to 
reach  its  full  buildout  potential.  Furthermore,  the  formally  approved  development  for  Area  "D"

has  not  undergone  any  development  to  date.  Given  that  these Area  "A"  and  "D"  developments  are 
already  approved  and  the  infrastructure  to  support  them  is  in  place,  it  was  determined  for  the 
purposes  of  this  study  that  the  inprocess/buildout  trips  should  be  included  in  the  background 
traffic  conditions.   The  methodology  for  determining  these  inprocess/buildout  trips  is  outlined  in 
the following sections. 

Area "A"
In  2010,  new  traffic  counts  were  conducted  during  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  (4:305:30  p.m.)  at 
all  of  the  main  intersections  serving  the  built  portion  of Area  "A". As  such,  these  volumes  indicate 
how much traffic is being generated by the portion of Area "A" that has been built to date. 

The latest site plan for Area "A" shows 706,806 square feet of retail, 100,000 square feet of office, and 
a  70room  motel.  At  the  time  of  the  2010  traffic  counts,  the  retail  component  of  Area  "A"  had 
526,093 square feet constructed and occupied. Based on the traffic volumes entering and exiting the 
site  at  the  intersections  of  Lockhaven  Drive/Chemawa  Road/Keizer  Station  Boulevard  and 
Chemawa  Road/Stadium  Drive/Ulali  Drive,  526,093  square  feet  of  Area  "A"  generated 
approximately  1,415  (725  inbound;  690  outbound)  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  driveway  trips.  This 
equates  to  an  observed  trip  generation  rate  of  approximately  2.69  trips  per  1,000  square  feet. 
Applying  this  rate  to  the  remaining  180,713  square  feet  of  retail  that  has  yet  to  develop,  it  is 
estimated  the  retail  component  of  Area  "A"  will  generate  approximately  485  additional  weekday 
p.m.  peak hour  trips  (primary  and  passby  trips).  The  office and  motel  components of Area  "A"  are 
estimated to add an additional 185 weekday p.m. peak hour trips. 

Area "D"
As previously mentioned, Area "D" is formally approved, but has not yet undergone development. 
Therefore  the  previous  trip  generation  (as  developed  in  the  2004  Keizer  Station  Master  Plan 
Transportation Impact Analysis) associated with Area "D" will be utilized for inprocess development. 

The  assumed  buildout/inprocess  development  trips  associated  with  Areas  "A"  and  "D"  are 
summarized in Table 6.

Site Layout, Trip Generation, Distribution, and
Assignment
This  section  describes  the  general  site  layout  for Area  "C"  and  applies  the  assumptions  outlined  in 
the previous section to the general development plan for Area "C".  


AREA "C" SITE LAYOUT

Figure  7  shows  the  general  site  layout  for  Area  "C".  The  proposed  site  access  layout  includes  the 
following provisions: 

Area "C" East of Chemawa Road
    ·    A  new  roadway  that  would  connect  to  Chemawa  Road  opposite  the  existing  McLeod  Lane 
         intersection.  The  intersection  with  Chemawa  Road/McLeod  Lane  would  be  full  access  and 
         assumed to be signalized based on the previous 2004 master planning study effort. 
    ·    A  rightin/rightout  driveway  off  of  Chemawa  Road  between  the  McLeod  Lane  and 
         Lockhaven Drive intersections. 

Area "C" West of Chemawa Road
    ·    A  full  access  unsignalized  driveway  located  off  of  McLeod  Lane  between  the  Lockhaven 
         Drive and Chemawa Road intersections. 
    ·    A  rightin/rightout  driveway  located  off  of  Chemawa  Road  between  Lockhaven  Drive  and 
         McLeod Lane. 
In  addition  to  the  site  access  provisions,  Area  "C"  is  proposing  to  enhance  the  Chemawa  Road 
corridor  south  of  the  Lockhaven  Drive  intersection  as  well  as  the  McLeod  Lane  corridor  between 
Lockhaven  Road  and  Chemawa  Road.  These  enhancements  are  based  on  the  original  guidance 
outlined in the 2004 master plan work and include the following: 

Chemawa Road
    ·    Widen  Chemawa  Road  to  a  fivelane  cross  section  from  Lockhaven  Drive  to  approximately 
         400  feet  south  of  McLeod  Lane  before  transitioning  back  to  the  existing  twolane  cross 
         section. 
    ·    At the intersection of Lockhaven Drive: 
             o    Provide  dual  northbound  rightturn  lanes,  a  single  through  lane,  and  a  single  left
                  turn lane. 
    ·    At the intersection of McLeod Lane: 
             o    Provide  a  leftturn  lane,  a  single  through  lane,  and  a  shared  through/rightturn  lane 
                  on both the north and southbound approaches.

McLeod Lane
    ·    Widen McLeod Lane to a threelane cross section from Lockhaven Drive to Chemawa Road. 
         Extend  McLeod  Lane  southeast  of  Chemawa  Road  and  connect  it  to  the  existing  Ridge 
         Drive. At  the  McLeod  Lane  extension  with  Ridge  Drive,  the  two  roadways  will  connect  as  a 
         continuous flow movement between the two corridors. 
    ·    At  the  Chemawa  Road  intersection,  provide  separate  left  and  shared  through/rightturn 
         lanes on the eastbound and westbound approaches. 


AREA "C" TRIP GENERATION

Although a precise development proposal for Area "C" has yet to be formally completed, E Village, 
LLC  is  proposing  to  develop  Area  "C"  with  a  mix  of  commercial,  office,  and  residential  uses 
consistent  with  the  current  zoning  of  the  respective  parcels.  A  conservative  estimate  of  uses  has 
been assumed that reflects the projected types of tenants that are likely to occupy the development. 
A  preliminary  outline  of  the  development  potential  is  shown  in  Table  8  below.  While  this  mix  of 
uses  and  square  footages  may  change,  it  is  considered  a  conservative  outline  that  will  adequately 
represent  the  reasonable  maximum  trip  generation  capabilities.  The  ITE  Trip  Generation  Manual 
(Reference 7) was utilized to estimate the trip generation potential.

develop  within  the  same  time  parameters  as Area  "C",  the  trip  generation  for  this  section  of  Keizer 
Station is summarized and the trips included within this study. 

Figure  8  shows  the  general  site  plan  for  Area  "B".  The  proposed  site  access  layout  includes  the 
following provisions: 

Area "B" East of Keizer Station Boulevard
    ·    A  rightin  only  driveway  located  off  of  Chemawa  Road  that  would  provide  access  to  the 
         office parking lot and crossover access to the Keizer Transit Center access road. 
    ·    A  full  access  driveway  located  off  of  Keizer  Station  Boulevard  that  would  provide  access  to 
         the  Keizer  Transit.  This  access  would  be  located  approximately  450  feet  north  of  the 
         Chemawa  Road/Lockhaven  Drive/Keizer  Station  Blvd  intersection.  For  the  purposes  of  this 
         analysis,  it  has  been  initially  assumed  that  the  access  would  be  signalized  and  coordinated 
         with the downstream Keizer Station Blvd/Chemawa Road/Lockhaven Drive intersection. 

Area "B" West of Keizer Station Boulevard
    ·    A  full  access  driveway  located  off  of  Keizer  Station  Boulevard  opposite  the  Keizer  Transit 
         Center access road. 
    ·    A  rightin/rightout  driveway  located  off  of  Lockhaven  Drive  between  the  Keizer  Station 
         Boulevard and McLeod Lane intersections. This driveway would include a westbound right
         turn deceleration lane. 
    ·    A full access driveway located off of McLeod Lane. 

Lockhaven Drive
    ·    A westbound rightturn deceleration lane to the Area "B" west rightin/rightout driveway. 

Keizer Station Boulevard
    ·    A widening of Keizer Station Boulevard west of the railroad underpass to accommodate two 
         south/westbound travel lanes and a separate leftturn lane at the Area "B" access. 
    ·    A  reconfiguration  of  the  southbound  Keizer  Station  Boulevard  approach  at  the  Chemawa 
         Road/Lockhaven  Drive/Keizer  Station  Boulevard  intersection  that  includes  dual  leftturn 
         lanes  and  a  separate  through  lane.  In  addition  to  the  lane  reconfigurations,  a  widening  of 
         the approach to include a separate southbound rightturn lane with 200' of storage. 


AREA "B" TRIP GENERATION

Area "B" will consist of  the Keizer Transit Center and a likely mix of medical/dental, general office, 
and  retail  uses.  For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  it  is  proposed  that Area  "B"  be  treated  as  inprocess 
traffic  given  its  significance  and  similar  development  timetable.  Outside  of  the  transit  center,  the 
ITE Trip Generation Manual was utilized to estimate the trip generation potential.

Site Layout, Trip Generation, Distribution, and Assignment


Trip  generation  during  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  for  the  proposed  transit  center  was  estimated 
by  performing  a  detailed  examination  of  the  bus  routes  that  would  use  the  transit  center  and  the 
parkandride  and  dropoff/pickup  facilities.  Local  knowledge  of  the  bus  routes  (as  provided  by 
SalemKeizer  Transit)  and  expected  usage  of  the  transit  center  was  used  instead  of  rates  from  the 
ITE  Trip  Generation  Manual,  as  it  was  determined  that  a  more  accurate  estimate  of  trips  could  be 
gained in this manner. Under full buildout conditions, the transit center is expected to have ten bus 
routes  with  30  total  buses  entering  the  facility  for  a  total  of  60  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  bus  trips. 
For the parkandride and dropoff/pickup facilities, 105 weekday p.m. peak hour trips are forecast 
under buildout conditions. Table 9 provides the estimated weekday p.m. peak hour bus and vehicle 
trips generated by the transit center and retail/office components under full buildout conditions.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION

The  distribution  of  the  sitegenerated  trips  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  surrounding  transportation 
system,  an  economic  study  conducted  as  part  of the  previous  Keizer  Station  master  planning  work, 
and  model  data  provided  by  the  Salem  Keizer  Area  Transportation  Study  (SKATS).  Figure  9 
illustrates the trip distribution for the primary trips. 


SUMMARY OF TRIPS

Figure  10  provides  a  summary  of  all  trips  reflecting  the  passby  and  primary/net  new  trips  being 
generated by Area "C" and Area "B". Figures E1 and E2 in Appendix E provides a detailed breakdown 
of trip types onto the study area network.

2020 Total Traffic Conditions
The  2020  traffic  conditions  analysis  identifies  site  conditions  and  the  expected  operational  and 
geometric  characteristics  of  roadways  within  the  study  area.  The  total  traffic  conditions  analysis 
forecasts  how  the  study  area's  transportation  system  will  operate  with  the  inclusion  of  traffic  from 
the eventual development of Area "C" 2 . 


2020 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

Year 2020 base traffic volumes were developed to compare the impact of the eventual development. 
Traffic volumes related to the development of Areas "C" and "B" (shown in Figure 10) were applied 
to  the  base 2020 traffic  volumes  (shown  in  Figure  6).  Figure 11  illustrates  the  resulting  forecast year 
2020 total traffic volumes for Areas "C" and "B". 

Operational Analysis
Figure  11  illustrates  the  2020  total  traffic  volumes,  level  of  service,  and  volumetocapacity  ratios 
during the weekday p.m. peak hour at the study intersections. Attachment "F" provides the 2020 total 
traffic  conditions  Synchro  worksheets  and  can  be  referenced  for  detailed  information  related  to  lane 
configurations, levels of service, and volumetocapacity ratios. 

As  shown  in  Figure  11  and  summarized  in  Table  10,  the  following  intersections  are  forecast  to 
continue  to  operate  above  capacity  or  at  unacceptable  levels:  In  other  words,  these  intersections 
were  already  forecast  to  operate  poorly  under  2020  background  traffic  conditions  and  are  now 
forecast to experience a worsening under development in Areas "C" and "B". 

      ·      Lockhaven Drive / River Road 
      ·      Chemwaw Road / I5 NB ramp terminal 
The  following  intersections  are  forecast  to  operate  above  capacity  or  at  unacceptable  levels  as  a 
direct result of the additional traffic generated by Areas "C" and "B".

Mitigation Measures
This  section  identifies  the  capacity  improvements  required  to  meet  the  operating  threshold  for  the 
year 2020 traffic conditions. 


PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES

Based  on  the  results  of  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  operational  analysis,  the  capacity 
improvements summarized in Table 11 are recommended in the study area to mitigate intersections 
that  are  either  operating  poorly/unacceptably  as  a  result  of  background  traffic  conditions  or  as  a 
result of additional traffic being generated by Areas "C" and "B".

                                      To Mitigate Traffic from both Areas "C" and "B"

    Lockhaven Drive / River Road    · Provide dual westbound left-turn lanes
                                    · Modify the east-west signal phasing from split phasing to protected phasing

    Lockhaven Drive / 14th Avenue   · Add a westbound right-turn lane on Lockhaven Drive

    Chemawa Road / I-5 NB ramp      · Modify the off-ramp approach to include dual northbound left-turn lanes, a
    terminal                          separate through lane and a separate right-turn lane
                                    · Provide dual eastbound left-turn lanes
                                    · Add a separate westbound right-turn lane

Conclusions and Recommendations




Conclusions and Recommendations
Based  on  the  results  of  the  traffic  impact  analysis,  development  in  Area  "C"  can  occur  with  the 
proposed  site  access  layout  while  maintaining  acceptable  levels  of  service  and  safety  on  the 
surrounding  transportation  system.  The  analysis  developed  the  following  conclusions  and 
recommendations. 


CONCLUSIONS

Existing Conditions
    ·    During  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour,  all  study  intersections  currently  operate  within 
         acceptable standards with the exception of the Chemawa Road/Verda Lane intersection. 

Year 2020 Background Traffic Conditions
    ·    The annual background growth rate within the study area was assumed to 1.0 percent. 
    ·    Areas  "A"  and  "D"  are  anticipated  to  buildout  within  the  2020  study  horizon  year.  Traffic 
         from this buildout is included in the 2020 background traffic conditions. 
    ·    The  following  planned  infrastructure  improvements  are  assumed  to  be  completed  by  the 
         City of Keizer by the year 2020. 
             o    Chemawa  Road  /  Verda  Lane    This  allway  stopcontrolled  intersection  will  be 
                  converted to a single lane roundabout. 
             o    Chemawa  Road  /  I5  southbound  ramp  terminal   Dual  westbound  rightturn  lanes 
                  and dual eastbound rightturn lanes will be implemented. 
    ·    The  following  intersections  are  forecast  to  operate  above  capacity  or  at  unacceptable  levels
         ofservice: 
             o    Lockhaven Drive / River Road 
             o    Chemawa Road / I5 NB ramp terminal 

Trip Generation
    ·    Development in Area "C" is estimated to generate approximately 805 net new weekday p.m. 
         peak hour trips. 
    ·    Development in Area "B" is estimated to generate approximately 330 net new weekday p.m. 
         peak hour trips. 
    ·    As  is  common  for  developments  of  this  nature,  the  specific  uses  are  likely  to  change  as  the 
         site  develops.  As  long  as  the  overall  trip  generation  remains  comparable  or  less,  the  traffic 
         study will remain valid.

Conclusions and Recommendations


Year 2020 Total Traffic Conditions
    ·    The  following  intersections  are  forecast  to  continue  to  operate  above  capacity  or  at 
         unacceptable levels: 
             o    Lockhaven Drive / River Road 
             o    Chemawa Road / I5 NB ramp terminal 
    ·    The  following  intersections  are  forecast  to  operate  above  capacity  or  at  unacceptable  levels 
         as a direct result of the additional traffic generated by Areas "C" and "B". 
             o    Lockhaven Drive / 14th Avenue 

Mitigation Measures
    ·    With  the  capacity  improvements  identified  in  Table  11,  the  study  area  intersections  will 
         operate within acceptable thresholds. 


RECOMMENDATIONS

For  the  transportation  system  to  operate  acceptably,  it  is  recommended  that  the  following  capacity 
improvements be implemented as a result of continued regional growth, buildout of Areas "C" and 
"B".

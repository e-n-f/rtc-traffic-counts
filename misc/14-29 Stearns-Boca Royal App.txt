                                   Stearns Property (Rezoning) and
               Boca Royale Future Phases Development Order Modification Narrative


Boca Royale Holdings, LLC, has prepared the attached rezoning request for the property generally
referred to as the Stearns Property and also requested a rezoning with modified stipulations for the
previously approved Development Order (Rezone Petition #97-36, Ordinance No. 98-061) for the
properties generally referred to as the Boca Royale – Future Phases including (specifically) stipulations
#1, #4 and #8.

Stearns Property:

The Applicant has prepared a rezone application and related development concept plan (DCP) (non-
binding) for the project known as the “Stearns Property”. The Stearns Property totals approximately 20.23
acres and proposes to include approximately 33 residential dwelling units with related open space.
Currently, the Stearns Property is proposed to be developed in one phase with construction beginning in
2014/15 and build-out/occupancy anticipated by 2020.

Stearns Property is located in south Sarasota County, east of Englewood Road (SR 776), south of Keyway
Road, north and west of the north terminus of N. Cayman Isles Blvd. Access is proposed to this property
via an extension of the current terminus of N. Cayman Isles Blvd through property owned by the
applicant; no access to Keyway Road is proposed.

As identified on the Sarasota County Future Land Use Map (FLUM), the Stearns Property is designated
as Low Density Residential (LDR) and is currently zoned Open Use Estate 1 (OUE-1). Consistent with
the adopted Comprehensive Plan, the Applicant proposes rezoning the subject property to Residential
Single- Family 1 (RSF-1) up to 2.0 dwelling units per acre and developing the property consistent with
the Cluster Subdivision standards. Although the RSF-1 zoning permits up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre,
the applicant is limited to rezone the property and develop up to 2.0 dwelling units per acre based on the
underlying FLUM designation. The Cluster Subdivision standards allow the applicant to provide site
specific development (lot) standards including residential type, size and setbacks. These standards also
require the applicant set aside 30 percent of the site for open space and provide a 1 percent community
focal point. As illustrated on the non-binding DCP, a minimum of 30 percent of the site is identified for
open spaces (i.e., lake feature, connection to Forked Creek, and natural buffers). Per previous discussions
with planning, zoning and environmental staff, the required 30 percent open space is not required to be
identified at this time but will be required to be demonstrated at the time of concurrent subdivision plan
review.

Stearns Property is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan with regard to development form,
program and intent. The neighborhood is intended to have specific design features and qualities, including
increased attention to overall project design, connectivity, and the natural environment. Specifically, the
project contains the following design elements including:

    ·   Compatibility with the adjacent development patterns and developed densities along SR 776 and
        adjacent residential developments to the east, south and west.

    ·   Open space provisions incorporated into the overall plan, including a 1 percent neighborhood
        focal point.

    ·   Open space/buffering along the north, west and south boundaries.

    ·   Access to N. Cayman Isles Boulevard.

                                    Stearns Property (Rezoning) and
                Boca Royale Future Phases Development Order Modification Narrative


Stearns Property density and development pattern are compatible and consistent with the adjacent
properties, specifically the Boca Royale community as well as developments within the SR 776 corridor
with regard to development pattern and density. The applicant is proposing to provide buffers along the
north, west and southern boundaries consisting of the existing vegetation, augmenting where necessary to
meet the County’s landscape and buffering standards. In addition, the applicant is proposing to provide a
small lake feature which will provide an additional buffer with the existing residences to the south. The
lake will also provide an additional wildlife habitat and a diversified environmental feature not currently
found on the property.

The Stearns Property is located within the Englewood Sector Plan (Resolution 86-480) and is consistent
with the relevant components of that Plan as follows:

    ·   Demonstrates capacity and availability of essential urban services including roadways, water and
        sewer, police and fire protection and medical services. Note:

            o    Access is provided via the internal Boca Royale roadway network with two (2) access
                 points to SR 776, a state maintained arterial roadway.

            o    Provides for public water and sanitary sewer. Note: utilities will be provided via the
                 Englewood Water District (EWD). A letter of service availability from EWD is provided
                 with this application.

            o    Existing police and fire (Sarasota County Sheriff and Sarasota County Fire).

            o    Existing medical services (Venice Regional Medical Center and the Englewood
                 Community Hospital are within approximately 6 miles of Boca Royale; additional
                 facilities are located in close proximity).

    ·   Additional components of the Englewood Sector Plan are not applicable. Specifically, the Stearns
        Property does not propose commercial development and is therefore not subject to Condition #5
        of the Englewood Sector Plan.



Boca Royale Future Phases

The Applicant is requesting a rezoning with amended stipulations to the previously approved Boca
Royale Future Phases (Ordinance No. 98-061). Specifically, the Applicant is requesting to amend the
following stipulations:

    ·   #1: The on-site wetlands and required upland buffers shall be preserved and labeled as preserves
        on all future plans. All proposed impacts (including road alignments) shall be subject to the
        review and approval of the Resource Permitting Division during the preliminary plan or site and
        development plan submittal.

    ·   #4: “Until a Development of Critical Concern (DOCC) determination is made, development of
        the parcel shall be limited to a maximum of 799 dwelling units.”


2|P ag e
                                                                   RZ 14-29 Rec'd by Planning Services 10/10/14
                                  Stearns Property (Rezoning) and
              Boca Royale Future Phases Development Order Modification Narrative


   ·   #8: “Dwelling units on the subject parcel within 200 feet of the northern and eastern property line
       shall be detached single-family dwellings on individual lots and the lots shall comply with the
       RSF-1 district standards for minimum lot requirements (100 feet in width, 15,000 square feet in
       area).”

Please note, Watershed Management staff has requested the following, additional stipulation be added to
the Development Order which would be added as #10:

   ·   #10 The Master Surface Water Management Plan shall be consistent with the Forked Creek and
       Gottfried Creek Basin Master Plans.



Ordinance No. 98-061 was adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of Sarasota County, Florida
July 28th, 1998. Changes to the Sarasota County Zoning requirements as well as changes in land uses
adjacent to the property have rendered Stipulations #4 and #8 outdated:

   ·   The wetlands identified as part of the respective rezoning request account for approximately 40
       percent of the existing site (38%). The Applicant/Owner have requested the ability to utilize a
       portion of the excess preservation acreage towards the open space requirements for adjacent
       properties acquired after this ordinance which are under control of the Applicant/Owner.
       Consistent with the revised and updated Open Space Exhibit, approximately 152.7 acres of open
       space (132.5 acres of wetlands and 20.2 acres of wetland buffers) are provided; 128.3 acres are
       required. If the Stearns Property is permitted to utilize a portion of the on-site wetlands towards
       its required open space (6.1 acres), there is still approximately 18.3 surplus acres of open space
       provided between the two areas.

   ·   Since adopting Ordinance 98-061, the County has redefined the requirements for DOCC to
       include properties proposing greater than 999 dwelling units; therefore Stipulation #4 is no longer
       relevant.

   ·   Sarasota County has also adopted “Cluster Subdivision” regulations which allow single-family
       developments to reduce lot areas and widths, in return for maintaining 30 percent common open
       space (minimum), and a community focal point at minimum one percent of the gross area of the
       subdivision. The restrictions set forth by Stipulation #8 do not allow the newer “Cluster
       Subdivision” dimensions, and therefore are no longer relevant.

   ·   In addition, there is a significant buffer along the eastern boundary via the 270’ wide FP&L
       easement.

   ·   Also, since the adoption of this ordinance, properties to the north have been designated as
       settlement and can provide housing types smaller than 15,000 square feet along the common
       boundary. The 15,000 minimum square foot lot requirement is inconsistent with the development
       pattern existing and under construction within other areas of Boca Royale.

For these reasons, the Applicant/Owner requests that Ordinance No. 98-061 be modified to amend
Stipulation #1, add Stipulation #10 and remove Stipulations #4 and #8. Deleted language is identified
with strike-through, new language is underlined

required open space on adjacent lands under control of the Owner with consistency demonstrated at the

DECEMBER 17, 2013

                                 STEARNS PROPERTY

                             REZONE PETITION
                         ENVIRONMENTAL NARRATIVE

The subject property is located north of the Boca Royal subdivision in southern
Sarasota County and is bound on the north by Keyway Road.

Please refer to the enclosed aerial FLUCCS Habitat Map.

UPLAND HABITATS
The parcel consists largely of Pine Flatwoods (Habitat 411) exhibiting slash and
longleaf pines with dense, over grown saw palmetto as the dominate ground cover.
The pine flatwood habitat, normally maintained by frequent fires has not been burned
for many and as such exhibits the extremely dense growth of saw palmetto.

The western portions of the property exhibit a mixture of pine and oak with less
dense saw palmetto. Also found in this area are scattered cabbage palms. This habitat
is classified as Habitat 434, Pine- Oak Mix.

EXCAVATED STORMWATER DITCH
The southwestern corner of the property contains a deeply cut, upland excavated
ditch which provides the surface water outfall for stormwater lakes within the Boca
Royale subdivision located to the south of the parcel. The ditch should be classified as
an “other surface water” by the SWFWMD. The surface water flows in the ditch are
intermittent, less than 3 ft. deep and as such should not be classified as a “water
course” Sarasota County.

LISTED SPECIES
The entire parcel has been inspected for the presence of endangered, threatened and
species of special concern (Listed Species). Listed species surveys have been
performed on the property during the summer and fall months of 2012 and 2013 to
   1523 8th Avenue West, Suite B, Palmetto FL 34221 -- Telephone 941.722.0901 Fax 941.722.4931

determine if any such species utilize the site for nesting or for breeding purposes. The
listed species surveys consisted of pedestrian transects and utilized the recognized
sampling techniques contained within “Standardized State-Listed Animal Survey
Procedures for SWFWMD ERP Projects”’ published by the FGFWFC on Feb. 10th
1997, for all listed species which may occur in those habitats comprising the site, while
using reasonable scientific judgment. In addition, a review of the FFWCC listed
species data base was performed.

The listed species surveys paid special attention to such species as gopher tortoises,
nesting bald eagles, indigo snakes, and the Florida pine snake.

The only listed species observed utilizing the site for nesting/breeding purposes was
the gopher tortoise. Several active burrows were observed in the higher elevations of
the site, in the eastern portions of the property. Please refer to the enclosed FLUCCS
Habitat Map/Listed Species Graphic for the approximate location of the burrows.

Prior to the development of the parcel, all appropriate permits will be obtained and
protective measures taken, relative to this species or any other species identified
during future listed species surveys.

SOUTH, RANGE 19 EAST, SARASOTA COUNTY, FLORIDA.
                                   Stearns Property (Rezoning) and
               Boca Royale Future Phases Development Order Modification Narrative


Boca Royale Holdings, LLC, has prepared the attached rezoning request for the property generally
referred to as the Stearns Property and also requested a rezoning with modified stipulations for the
previously approved Development Order (Rezone Petition #97-36, Ordinance No. 98-061) for the
properties generally referred to as the Boca Royale – Future Phases including (specifically) stipulations
#1, #4 and #8.

Stearns Property:

The Applicant has prepared a rezone application and related development concept plan (DCP) (non-
binding) for the project known as the “Stearns Property”. The Stearns Property totals approximately 20.23
acres and proposes to include approximately 33 residential dwelling units with related open space.
Currently, the Stearns Property is proposed to be developed in one phase with construction beginning in
2014/15 and build-out/occupancy anticipated by 2020.

Stearns Property is located in south Sarasota County, east of Englewood Road (SR 776), south of Keyway
Road, north and west of the north terminus of N. Cayman Isles Blvd. Access is proposed to this property
via an extension of the current terminus of N. Cayman Isles Blvd through property owned by the
applicant; no access to Keyway Road is proposed.

As identified on the Sarasota County Future Land Use Map (FLUM), the Stearns Property is designated
as Low Density Residential (LDR) and is currently zoned Open Use Estate 1 (OUE-1). Consistent with
the adopted Comprehensive Plan, the Applicant proposes rezoning the subject property to Residential
Single- Family 1 (RSF-1) up to 2.0 dwelling units per acre and developing the property consistent with
the Cluster Subdivision standards. Although the RSF-1 zoning permits up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre,
the applicant is limited to rezone the property and develop up to 2.0 dwelling units per acre based on the
underlying FLUM designation. The Cluster Subdivision standards allow the applicant to provide site
specific development (lot) standards including residential type, size and setbacks. These standards also
require the applicant set aside 30 percent of the site for open space and provide a 1 percent community
focal point. As illustrated on the non-binding DCP, a minimum of 30 percent of the site is identified for
open spaces (i.e., lake feature, connection to Forked Creek, and natural buffers). Per previous discussions
with planning, zoning and environmental staff, the required 30 percent open space is not required to be
identified at this time but will be required to be demonstrated at the time of concurrent subdivision plan
review.

Stearns Property is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan with regard to development form,
program and intent. The neighborhood is intended to have specific design features and qualities, including
increased attention to overall project design, connectivity, and the natural environment. Specifically, the
project contains the following design elements including:

    ·   Compatibility with the adjacent development patterns and developed densities along SR 776 and
        adjacent residential developments to the east, south and west.

    ·   Open space provisions incorporated into the overall plan, including a 1 percent neighborhood
        focal point.

    ·   Open space/buffering along the north, west and south boundaries.

    ·   Access to N. Cayman Isles Boulevard.

                                    Stearns Property (Rezoning) and
                Boca Royale Future Phases Development Order Modification Narrative


Stearns Property density and development pattern are compatible and consistent with the adjacent
properties, specifically the Boca Royale community as well as developments within the SR 776 corridor
with regard to development pattern and density. The applicant is proposing to provide buffers along the
north, west and southern boundaries consisting of the existing vegetation, augmenting where necessary to
meet the County’s landscape and buffering standards. In addition, the applicant is proposing to provide a
small lake feature which will provide an additional buffer with the existing residences to the south. The
lake will also provide an additional wildlife habitat and a diversified environmental feature not currently
found on the property.

The Stearns Property is located within the Englewood Sector Plan (Resolution 86-480) and is consistent
with the relevant components of that Plan as follows:

    ·   Demonstrates capacity and availability of essential urban services including roadways, water and
        sewer, police and fire protection and medical services. Note:

            o    Access is provided via the internal Boca Royale roadway network with two (2) access
                 points to SR 776, a state maintained arterial roadway.

            o    Provides for public water and sanitary sewer. Note: utilities will be provided via the
                 Englewood Water District (EWD). A letter of service availability from EWD is provided
                 with this application.

            o    Existing police and fire (Sarasota County Sheriff and Sarasota County Fire).

            o    Existing medical services (Venice Regional Medical Center and the Englewood
                 Community Hospital are within approximately 6 miles of Boca Royale; additional
                 facilities are located in close proximity).

    ·   Additional components of the Englewood Sector Plan are not applicable. Specifically, the Stearns
        Property does not propose commercial development and is therefore not subject to Condition #5
        of the Englewood Sector Plan.



Boca Royale Future Phases

The Applicant is requesting a rezoning with amended stipulations to the previously approved Boca
Royale Future Phases (Ordinance No. 98-061). Specifically, the Applicant is requesting to amend the
following stipulations:

    ·   #1: The on-site wetlands and required upland buffers shall be preserved and labeled as preserves
        on all future plans. All proposed impacts (including road alignments) shall be subject to the
        review and approval of the Resource Permitting Division during the preliminary plan or site and
        development plan submittal.

    ·   #4: “Until a Development of Critical Concern (DOCC) determination is made, development of
        the parcel shall be limited to a maximum of 799 dwelling units.”

              Boca Royale Future Phases Development Order Modification Narrative


   ·   #8: “Dwelling units on the subject parcel within 200 feet of the northern and eastern property line
       shall be detached single-family dwellings on individual lots and the lots shall comply with the
       RSF-1 district standards for minimum lot requirements (100 feet in width, 15,000 square feet in
       area).”

Please note, Watershed Management staff has requested the following, additional stipulation be added to
the Development Order which would be added as #10:

   ·   #10 The Master Surface Water Management Plan shall be consistent with the Forked Creek and
       Gottfried Creek Basin Master Plans.



Ordinance No. 98-061 was adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of Sarasota County, Florida
July 28th, 1998. Changes to the Sarasota County Zoning requirements as well as changes in land uses
adjacent to the property have rendered Stipulations #4 and #8 outdated:

   ·   The wetlands identified as part of the respective rezoning request account for approximately 40
       percent of the existing site (38%). The Applicant/Owner have requested the ability to utilize a
       portion of the excess preservation acreage towards the open space requirements for adjacent
       properties acquired after this ordinance which are under control of the Applicant/Owner.
       Consistent with the revised and updated Open Space Exhibit, approximately 152.7 acres of open
       space (132.5 acres of wetlands and 20.2 acres of wetland buffers) are provided; 128.3 acres are
       required. If the Stearns Property is permitted to utilize a portion of the on-site wetlands towards
       its required open space (6.1 acres), there is still approximately 18.3 surplus acres of open space
       provided between the two areas.

   ·   Since adopting Ordinance 98-061, the County has redefined the requirements for DOCC to
       include properties proposing greater than 999 dwelling units; therefore Stipulation #4 is no longer
       relevant.

   ·   Sarasota County has also adopted “Cluster Subdivision” regulations which allow single-family
       developments to reduce lot areas and widths, in return for maintaining 30 percent common open
       space (minimum), and a community focal point at minimum one percent of the gross area of the
       subdivision. The restrictions set forth by Stipulation #8 do not allow the newer “Cluster
       Subdivision” dimensions, and therefore are no longer relevant.

   ·   In addition, there is a significant buffer along the eastern boundary via the 270’ wide FP&L
       easement.

   ·   Also, since the adoption of this ordinance, properties to the north have been designated as
       settlement and can provide housing types smaller than 15,000 square feet along the common
       boundary. The 15,000 minimum square foot lot requirement is inconsistent with the development
       pattern existing and under construction within other areas of Boca Royale.

For these reasons, the Applicant/Owner requests that Ordinance No. 98-061 be modified to amend
Stipulation #1, add Stipulation #10 and remove Stipulations #4 and #8. Deleted language is identified
with strike-through, new language is underlined

#1: The on-site wetlands and required upland buffers shall be preserved and labeled as preserves on all
future plans. All proposed impacts (including road alignments) shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Resource Permitting Division during the preliminary plan or site and development plan
submittal. Open space areas in excess of the minimum 30 percent may be used in the calculations for
required open space on adjacent lands under control of the Owner with consistency demonstrated at the
time of concurrent subdivision approval.

and Gottfried Creek Basin Master Plans.

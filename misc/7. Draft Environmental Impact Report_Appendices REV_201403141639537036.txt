The City of Larkspur will be the Lead Agency and will prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the
Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan. The City is requesting comments from responsible agencies regarding the
scope and content of the environmental document. The public is also invited to submit comments regarding
the scope of the EIR.

Project Location: The Larkspur SMART Station would be located in the SMART right-of-way east of Highway
101, north of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, near the terminus of the Cal Park Hill Tunnel bike path. The station
lies above and just west of Larkspur Landing, a mixed use area that includes residential, office and retail uses.
As shown in Figure 1, the 405-acre study area is defined by an approximately Â½ mile radius circle around that
station, with the addition of an area to the south known as the Redwood Highway area (see Plan Map below)

Project Description: The City of Larkspur is preparing the Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan. The SMART
(Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit) is a passenger train and multi-use pathway project planned to extend 70
miles from Cloverdale in Sonoma County to Larkspur in Marin County. The Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan
will identify potential land use and regulatory changes that are intended to support transit oriented
development in the area surrounding the planned SMART station. More information on the SMART Station
Area Plan can be found on the City of Larkspur website at:
http://www.larkspurcityhall.org/index.aspx?nid=157.

Potential Environmental Effects: It has been determined that an EIR will be necessary to analyze potential
environmental impacts associated with the proposed project. Specific areas of analysis will include, but will not
be limited to the following topics: Land Use and Planning Policy; Transportation and Circulation; Air Quality;
Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Noise/Vibration; Biological Resources; Hydrology and Water Quality; Geology;
Hazards and Hazardous Materials; Utilities and Pubic Services; and Cultural Resources.

Due to the time limits mandated by State law, your response to this NOP must be submitted by Friday,
February 15, 2013. Please address your written comments to: Neal Toft, Director of Planning and Building, City
of Larkspur, 400 Magnolia Avenue, Larkspur, CA 94939 or ntoft@cityoflarkspur.org

A scoping session for the preparation of the EIR will be held at 7:30 p.m. on January 22, 2013 at Larkspur City
Hall, City Council Chambers, 400 Magnolia Avenue, Larkspur. The public and public agencies are invited to
attend the scoping session to provide comments regarding the scope and content of the EIR.

Cindy Winter, Greenbrae
   - She favors higher density in Larkspur Landing and if it is done right it can be a model of
      land use planning to be proud of
   - She is worried most new residents will bring cars with them into a geographically
      confined area
   - Without excellent multi-modal facilities there will be gridlock and more GHG emissions
   - One way to reduce congestion in Larkspur Landing is to encourage people who live
      outside it to walk and bicycle into it
   - The bike/pedestrian overpass over 101 will be demolished and not replaced as part of
      the Highway 101 project contrary to the wishes of many
   - She worked out an alternative overcrossing design and discussed it with Bill Whitney
      and Neal Toft. An independent engineer says he believes it works
   - The next steps is a conference with Caltrans engineers
   - The Caltrans proposed route through Wornum and along Redwood Highway will
      discourage biking and walking
   - She is an experienced cyclist and the sections are disagreeable at best and at worst
      dangerous
   - Not all walkers and riders will find it possible to go north of CM Creek to avoid these
      inconveniences and will jump in their car instead
   - Station Area planners need to consider these issues because in Sub-area 1a
      connectivity to the station is critical
   - There is no use for a CMFC if it is separated from the popular and beautiful Sandra
      Marker Trail by the freeway.
   - Not sure whether the SMART station planners can take a position as a group and ask
      TAM to reconsider some of their designs but at least you can reflect on it

Sandy Guldman, Larkspur
   - As an individual who bikes, she strongly supports retaining the overpass over 101
   - As president of Friends of Corte Madera Creek Watershed, she is concerned about
      proximity of development at ferry terminal to a hotbed of clapper rails in the tidal marsh
      south of the terminal
   - Very environmentally sensitive area and any development there will be constrained by
      the need to protect that habitat

Alisha OâLoughlin, Planning Director of Marin County Bicycle Coalition
    - Preferred plan supports moderate to higher density residential development, new retail
       and employment and acknowledges the areaâs older demographic; all of these support
       the need for alternative transportation options
    - The report calls for improving connections between Redwood Highway North, Larkspur
       downtown and Larkspur Landing
    - The report notes congestion is already an issue and will likely be exacerbated with build
       out in the Preferred Plan; with additional higher density development comes more traffic
    - Plan supports mode shift measures and identifies improvements to bike/pedestrian
       connections
    - Simultaneously TAM and Caltrans are developing the Hwy 101 GB improvement project
       that calls for demolition of overpass and no replacement
    - Removal will undoubtedly affect bike and pedestrian connectivity safety and perceived
       safety within and adjacent to the SAP planning area
    - Imperative the SAP EIR take into account the removal of the overpass on bike and

        pedestrian circulation in the Station Area
   -    Will Caltrans improvements adequately provide for future development intensity and
        pedestrian and bike goals and objectives identified in SAP?
   -    Imperative that SAP EIR evaluates what future pedestrian and bike conditions will be
        once TAM project is built with current design rather than evaluate conditions as are
        currently on the ground
   -    TAM project includes bike and pedestrian enhancements to Wornum drive but they will
        not substitute for the safety of the existing separated from traffic overcrossing
   -    Too much to ask for timid, young, or less-abled walkers and bikers
   -    Existing overcrossing is used by locals and is the primary north-south greenway from
        Golden Gate Bridge to Novato
   -    County has goal for 20% of all trips to be made by biking and walking by 2020 and we
        need safe separate facilities to achieve that
   -    Removal of overcrossing will divide community
   -    Proposed TAM project is inconsistent with General Plans of Larkspur, Corte Madera,
        and the County with regards to fostering connectivity within and between communities
        and policies encouraging an increase in bike and pedestrian modes
   -    SAP EIR should evaluate future bike/pedestrian needs and impacts as relate to TAM
        project given current design

Mike Hooper, Larkspur
   - Member of SAP CAC
   - Project description on NOP is not adequate; needs to be succinct, but needs to provide
      the community with a reasonable chance of understanding what this project is
   - Project is not just the preferred alternative but the range of mitigation measures being
      proposed
   - Those measures include reduced parking at ferry terminal and paid parking at the
      terminal, shuttle buses and trolleys to get to the ferry terminal, and other traffic mitigation
      measures
   - Need clear examples of mitigation measures
   - Numbers are not enough; examples that we can be comfortable with are required
   - The SAP EIR needs to provide for a range of densities
   - When the Plan comes to PC in future with specific projects, he hates to think PC and
      Council will get stuck with approving a particular project for a particular density
   - SAP EIR should provide for a range of alternatives, in between âno projectâ and the
      preferred plan
   - SMART station needs to come to the terminal and shouldnât come to Larkspur at all
      unless it goes to terminal; SAP EIR needs to analyze that
   - SAP EIR should include a growth control plan; analyze the time these developments
      should occur and allow development to move forward only if the mitigation measures are
      brought to bear
   - Told at last CAC meeting this was a long-range plan, not to worry about it because it
      wonât happen in his lifetime or the consultantâs lifetime. He does worry, he has kids
   - Project is $600,000 and it needs to be a worthwhile $600,000 and needs to consider a
      wide range of alternatives
   - âTransferable development rightsâ allow one property owner to purchase from another
      property owner development rights; a degree of flexibility
   - Frequently developers find that projects donât work in the context theyâre given
   - Transferable development rights accomplish many things- e.g. if excess capacity on
      ferry site, owner could sell the development rights to the apartment owners on the hill
      and they could double their density

   -    He thinks the densities are too high
   -    Traffic mitigation wonât work without extraordinary effort
   -    Perception will be 40 du/ac on some locations is just too much

Don Graff, Greenbrae
   - SAP CAC member
   - Should create transportation hub in this area- ferry, Airporter, SMART, and buses in a
      single location which would enhance usage of SMART and ferry
   - Would cause changes to preferred plan in terms of uses at ferry terminal that may have
      to be decreased in size or moved up to where the SMART station is proposed currently
   - Would be a good process for the SAP EIR to include as a part of an alternative

Jean Severinghaus, Greenbrae Boardwalk
   - Involved with GP and Station Area Plan process for several years
   - Excited about increased development and density near transit
   - Lives across creek to the south and can walk to the Airporter or ferry
   - Can ride a bike to west Marin or north Marin in a short time
   - She hasnât seen very much planning of circulation for multi-modal circulation around the
      station itself
   - Major environmental problem is the congestion of Highway 101that the SMART train is
      trying to address
   - Sonoma residents will be most likely users going south to jobs in Marin
   - County Bike and Pedestrian Plan from 2008 notes a major opportunity to get people
      going 15 minutes or less in car to switch mode to walking or biking by improving
      connections
   - Need to improve the âlast mileâ after getting off transit
   - In regards to the Highway 101 improvement project, the community is being offered
      whatâs expedient to accommodate a freeway expansion, not been looked at by local
      groups
   - Need to ask for at least 2.5 miles of looking at bike and pedestrian trails and connections
   - Removal the overcrossing: if you go by the north route under the creek and loop around
      to get to Lucky drive itâs Â¾ mile- across overpass itâs Â½ mile. Increase for walkers of 5
      minutes; that's the time it takes to drive from Tamalpais highway on-ramp to Terra Linda
      in a car. It will impact people's choices
   - EIR should look at impacts of 1.5-6 in of Sea level rise in Redwood Highway north
      particularly to analyze impacts on circulation in area


                              Planning Commissioner Comments

Commissioner Jeff Stahl
   -    Surprised the two existing apartment in Larkspur Landing werenât identified as
        opportunity sites given their low density
   -    Thatâs an area that could tolerate more height without visual impacts
   -    Lost opportunity to consider re-densification there- not just about vacant parking lots
   -    Analysis of challenges to the area neglects to mention the geographic isolation of
        Larkspur Landing area from the rest of the city, including public services.
   -    Mike Hooperâs comments about a range of densities were worthwhile
   -    Seems to be a a good idea to apply an aggregate density to the entire area and then
        allow for flexibility in distributing that density across different sites



DRAFT                                                                                     1/28/2013
   -    Ferry terminal parking lot is a ripe opportunity for increasing parking; adding housing
        with its own parking requirement would be a monster building
   -    Should be designed to transfer density from one opportunity site to another within an
        aggregate limit
   -    The SAP EIR should look at what proposed mix of uses and densities it will achieve will
        support in terms of retail; not what Marin Country Mart is becoming
   -    Need grocery services in the area; restaurants; how support?
   -    Marin Country Mart is not becoming a neighborhood supporting venue
   -    Isolated character of the area is counterintuitive to hosting a senior demographic
   -    Walking and biking is great for active and able people, but seniors need assistance with
        access; shuttles would help, or wordsmith language about supporting an older
        demographic
   -    Geographic hazards should be analyzed; the ferry site is probably on fill
   -    Climate change impacts should be analyzed; seems important especially regarding sea
        level rise
   -    Notion of a parking district makes sense; look at allowing parking along Larkspur
        Landing Circle
   -    Supports serious consideration of potential of creating an alternative in the EIR that
        considers the SMART station at the ferry terminal

Commissioner Monte Deignan
   -    SMART station location makes no sense
   -    If we are going to study TOD, why leave the Airporter and SMART train in a tiny
        landlocked section of the Larkspur Landing area?
   -    The SAP EIR should study how to move the station over to ferry terminal as a transit hub
   -    Can SMARTâs hand be forced in this?
   -    As a long-range plan, will it look at potential impacts of San Quentinâs closure? The end
        of the peninsula would be ideal transit hub; does that enter into the study?
   -    Would like to see bike connections improved; crossing the highway at Larkspur Landing
        is a disaster

Planning Director Toft
   -    Relocating the SMART station has been raised by the CAC and public
   -    The SMART train was planned and voted on in its configuration and the extension from
        San Rafael phase 2 is not funded at this time
   -    SMART, one of partner agencies, has indicated they donât have funding right now to
        study an alternative
   -    Identifying a desire to consolidate transportation options and such a policy will be in the
        Plan
   -    SMART has indicated that station itself is a simple platform and should in the future it be
        relocated it wouldnât be substantially costly to relocate

Commissioner Mark Sandoval
   -    Agrees with commissioners about possible loss of opportunities
   -    To have a transportation hub at the ferry is common sense and we are skirting the issue
        with planning efforts that could be focusing on that.

   -    Shares a lot of concerns from public and commissioners
   -    There is a consensus among the community to encourage the transportation hub as a
        preferred alternative
   -    Do the funding constraints and decisions of other agencies truly constrain what the
        preferred alternative would be for CEQA purposes?
   -    Can we present a preferred alternative that is more of what the community wants, while
        it may not be the alternative that moves forward?
   -    For planning purposes a preferred alternative should incorporate those concepts at the
        outset and to the extent necessary back away if they are not feasible; at least set up in
        preferred alternative sends a message to the partner agencies
   -    Significant mixed use and residential development proposed in Plan for current ferry
        terminal parking lot
   -    Current parking needs of terminal need to be addressed. Structured parking there is
        financially infeasible
   -    Worries that planning assumes actions that arenât feasible
   -    It would be helpful if the other agencies that will play an important role in funding are
        involved as early as possible; commitments and assurances will be important to success
        of this plan
   -    Does CEQA analyze the economic feasibility of the different planning elements
        proposed going to be taken into account

Planning Director Toft
   -    Next planning phase will analyze infrastructure and funding needs and will inform us on
        what funding opportunities are available and how additional parking needs from new
        development could be balanced
   -    Will identify impacts and issues in conjunction with refining the plan
   -    Opportunity for funding will come with supportive densities and uses

Planning Commission Chair Richard Young
   -    Heard tonight concerns about loss of overpass and that connectivity particularly for
        residents on Redwood Highway area
   -    Station should be relocated
   -    Isolation of Larkspur Landing area should be considered
   -    Parking needs should be analyzed and integrated parking is essential
   -    Should be a diversity of densities, a range
   -    Growth control of development

Re: Scoping Comments for the Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan

Dear Mr. Toft:

We are assuming that all of the concerns conveyed by members of the Citizens Advisory Com-
mittee and summarized in the Plan will be evaluated in the DEIR. If they are not already be-
ing included in the scoping comments, we ask that they be analyzed in the DEIR that is being
prepared for the Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan. The Plan has the potential for substantial
environmental impacts that need to be carefully analyzed and considered.

SEA LEVEL RISE
Some of the development contemplated by the Plan is located in areas that will be subject to
sea level rise associated with global warming. The DEIR should fully address the impacts of sea
level rise over the decades long life of any projects, and should bar development and/or impose
mitigation measures to deal with it.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The area south of the ferry terminal, particularly the Heerdt Marsh, which is part of the Corte
Madera Ecological Reserve and home to the endangered Clapper Rail, is an environmentally
sensitive area that is likely to suffer adverse impacts if the proposed high-density development
plan is implemented. The nature and extent of these impacts needs to be analyzed and mitiga-
tion measures should be included in the DEIR.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (1)
The proposed high-density development will certainly contribute to congestion on Sir Francis
Drake, which will add to greenhouse gas emissions and adversely impact air quality. The DEIR
needs to fully analyze these impacts and go beyond suggesting that it will be necessary for
major improvements and capacity increases to be made to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in order
to accommodate the development proposed in the Plan. The plan should state specifically that
any density increase in the area shall be conditional on at least maintaining the LOS on Sir Fran-
cis Drake(SFD) and the EIR should reflect that approach. As the LOS is currently at F in this area
during peak hours, the DEIR should preferably stipulate a mitigation requirement that improve-
ments to SFD must be in place prior to any increases in density in the area, so as to bring the
LOS to an acceptable level. Likewise, the Plan assumes the construction of a SMART station, but
it is not clear when or even if such a station will be built. Implementation of the plan should be
contingent the confirmed presence of a SMART station, and if not, then the DEIR should analyze

Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan Scoping Comments/Feb. 15, 2013


the impacts of the Plan if the station is not built and all of the new residents, instead, are lim-
ited to presently available transportation systems.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (2)
Although the project areas designated for both the Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan and the
Highway 101 Greenbrae/Twin Cities Corridor Improvement Plan proposed by the Transportation
Authority of Marin are overlapping, there is barely any acknowledgment of that fact by either
sponsoring entity in their own projectâs documentation. What are the impacts of TAMâs pro-
posed plan for a massive highway construction project within the same project area? What im-
pacts will it have on the Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan? What impacts will Plan implemen-
tation have on 101 traffic? Does highway 101 have capacity to accommodate the large increase
in population in an already congested freeway corridor? Again, the answers to these questions
address the possibility that a SMART station will not be built.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (3)
Despite uncertainties about whether the proposed Highway 101 Greenbrae/Twin Cities Corridor
Improvement Project will ever be constructed, removal of the pedestrian-bicycle highway over-
pass between Lucky Drive and Industrial Way would have a significant impact on pedestrian and
bicycle circulation routes in the Plan area. What are the ramifications of the overpass removal
on the Planâs anticipated benefits of multi-modal options for pedestrians and bicyclists?

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (4)
As there are no similarly situated, comparable, transit-oriented developments of this scale
in the Bay Area, the DEIR should provide reliable data that documents the assumption that a
combination of bicycle, transit, and ferry options available will actually result in a significantly
demonstrable decrease in the residentsâ use of automobiles. The DEIR should provide data
demonstrating that (1) most residents of the 948 new housing units will work in the City and
take the ferry to work each day, (2) that bus service will be available to take them to wherever
else in the County they work, shop, go to school, socialize, exercise, and/or play sports, (3) that
many jobs in the immediate Plan area will be held by residents of the immediate Plan area, who
will walk or bicycle to work. Will the plan include any controls that insure that residents rely on
public transit, biking or walking?

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (5)
It is obvious that the large number of new residents will not use public transit/biking/walk-
ing 100% of the time, and, therefore, there will be some increase in vehicular traffic. What is
the expected increase in vehicular traffic and what are the impacts? The DEIR should provide
reliable, relevant data to show that the net increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as a result
of this high-density project would not have a demonstrable adverse impact on air quality and
greenhouse gas emissions.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (6)
A high-density development of this scale involves parking issues that should be fully examined
in the DEIR, with mitigations proposed. Will it be necessary to construct a double-deck parking

Marin Conservation League                                                                           3
Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan Scoping Comments/Feb. 15, 2013


structure at the ferry terminal parking lot? Will it be necessary to create a parking district that
would construct parking in other parts of the development? Is there some other means of pro-
viding sufficient parking? The preferred alternative should include recommendations for resolv-
ing the parking problem as part of the DEIR.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (7)
The issue of transit scattering versus a transit hub warrants examination in the DEIR, as many
concerns have been expressed about the SMART station being located so far from the ferry
terminal. Although the proposed extension of SMART has no funding and is not included in the
current phase of SMART construction, the feasibility of relocating the station should be exam-
ined in the DEIR as part of the preferred alternative.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (8)
An older demographic will likely require some sort of shuttle service to meet the needs of resi-
dents who require services not available in the immediate area and are unable to reach such
services by walking or bicycling. Is it feasible to require a shuttle service as part of a develop-
ment plan? What are the costs such a service and where will the funding come from? If private
developers are required to provide this service, what measures will be imposed to insure com-
pliance?

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (9)
The Plan correctly assumes that older people donât drive as much, but they do require most
support and care workers who will need parking close to residences. Also, older retired people
who can still drive are more likely to make multiple mid-day trips. How is this being addressed
in the Plan?

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION (10)
If new residents are expected to use the Larkspur Ferry, what will be the impact of the Plan on
ferry service, which is currently operating at or near capacity during commute hours? Will it
be necessary to add new ferries to provide added capacity? If so, what will it cost, and is there
funding available?

HYDROLOGY/DRAINAGE
Although the proposed areas for development all appear to be above elevations that currently
flood, all access roads in the Plan area are shown to be below the level of 100-year floods,
which seem to occur every few years, even without considering sea-level rise. It is now gener-
ally recognized that one result of global warming is to produce storm events of greater intensity
and severity. How often will access to newly developed areas be impeded due to flooding? The
DEIR should explain how to mitigate the lack of ingress and egress for residents and workers,
as well as its impact on the ability of police, firefighters, and paramedics to respond in case of
medical emergencies and disasters of various kinds that occur when access is unavailable due to
flooding.

Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan Scoping Comments/Feb. 15, 2013


LAND USE CONSISTENCY AND COMPATIBILITY (1)
The project description needs to provide the community with a better understanding of what
the project actually includes, and what kinds of mitigation measures are being proposed. Be-
cause it is being made an integral part of the Larkspur General Plan Update we understand that
no additional DEIR will be required at the time one or more developers come forward to imple-
ment the approved plan. Therefore, it is very important to describe and analyze each compo-
nent of the Plan in the DEIR so that appropriate mitigations can be required at this time, before
the Plan is approved.

LAND USE CONSISTENCY AND COMPATIBILITY (2)
The Plan indicates that housing in the Plan area will likely be affordable only to households
earning less than 120 percent of AMI, and that Federal, state, and local financing sources will be
needed to develop housing that is affordable to households with lower incomes. It goes on to
state that the gap between subsidies provided by low-income housing tax credits, bond financ-
ing, and other typical sources and construction costs will probably be in excess of $100,000 per
unit. That gap would have to be filled by local financing sources, housing trust funds (which are
not currently available) and in-lieu fees. The Plan states that the Local Housing Subsidy needed
would range between $41,972,519 and $57,448,800. The DEIR should explain how this deficit,
which would likely make implementation of the proposed Plan impossible, would be mitigated.
Where will these funds come from and is it realistic to assume that such funding will be avail-
able? What will happen if no funding is available?

LAND USE CONSISTENCY AND COMPATIBILITY (3)
The growth projections indicated in various parts of the Plan are based on the Bay Area Jobs-
Housing Connection Strategy estimates issued in May 2012 by ABAG and MTC that are inconsis-
tent with the recent projections published by the California Department of Finance, which state
that growth in Marin County will be essentially stagnant between now and 2050. That should
be taken into account in evaluating the alternatives studied in the DEIR, particularly regarding
the market for retail and employment in the area.

LAND USE CONSISTENCY AND COMPATIBILITY (4)
Neighborhood-supporting retail is a significant need in an area separated from the rest of the
community by a major freeway, and the DEIR should examine the economic viability of locating
businesses such as a grocery store there. The Larkspur âCountry Martâ has attempted, without
success, to provide grocery services. Is it realistic to assume that groceries and other day-to-day
retail services will be provided? What level of population is needed to support these services?
If they are not provided, will residents use automobiles to travel for basic necessities?

LAND USE CONSISTENCY AND COMPATIBILITY (5)
In an area where high-density development is so tightly focused on use of multi-modal tran-
sit such as the ferry terminal, the ramifications of liquefaction in event of a major earthquake
should be studied and discussed in the DEIR.

Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan Scoping Comments/Feb. 15, 2013


PUBLIC SERVICES (1)
The Marin Municipal Water District has a longstanding deficit in its ability to provide all of the
water needed within its jurisdiction on a long-term basis that is likely to include drought years.
The DEIR should explain the how the proposed high-density development would obtain the
water it requires without impacting existing water users.

PUBLIC SERVICES (2)
As the majority of housing units in the Plan area lie within the San Rafael School District, the
DEIR should discuss the impacts of transporting students to elementary, middle, and high school
locations that are a considerable distance from the Plan area. How will students get to and from
schools? Will public transit, such as school buses, be provided? If so, what will it cost and how
will it be funded? If not, how many students will be driven to and from school, and what will be
the impacts of the additional traffic?

COMMUNITY COHESIVENESS
Geographic isolation of the Larkspur Landing area from other parts of the Larkspur community
is a factor that should be evaluated, with mitigation and adaptation strategies identified in the
DEIR.

                                  areas to the east of Larkspur Landing include: (1) both the
                                  east and west directions on the north and south sides of
Interstate 580, (2) the connection of the existing Shoreline Bay Trail in San Rafael to
both the new viewing area near the Richmond/San Rafael Bridge and Remillard Park in
Larkspur, (3) from the south side of the I-580 on-ramp at Main Street to the intersection
of Andersen Drive with Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, (4) the Andersen Drive/Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard intersection itself to determine the feasibility of improvements that
would enable cyclists and pedestrians to safely cross the intersection, (5) access from
the I-580 on-ramp to the San Quentin Prison entrance through San Quentin Village, (6)
access/egress to/from existing bus stops that provide service across the bridge (which is
closed to bicycles and pedestrians), (7) Main Street under I-580, and (8) the connection
from the I-580 onramp to East Francisco Boulevard.

The intersection of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and Andersen Drive presently proves
challenging for motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians alike. This area is also physically
bisected by I-580, which runs along the northern edge of the study area. Bike access is
permitted on the shoulder of I-580 from the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard onramp to Main
Street. There is a partially paved, rustic pathway connecting the I-580 flyover to East
Francisco Boulevard. This pathway serves several office buildings, residences and
recreational destinations located off of East Francisco Boulevard. At this time, bikes are
not permitted on the Richmond/San Rafael Bridge, but regional transit buses equipped
with bike racks make the connection to the East Bay. The San Francisco Bay Trail is
improved on the northern and southern edges of the study area, thus it represents a key
gap in the continuity of the regional trail system. San Quentin prison visitor use and
employees also generate pedestrian traffic along Main Street.

The area includes several medium- to large-sized office buildings, a State penitentiary, a
private recreational club, public recreational facilities and residential housing. In close
proximity are several residential neighborhoods, large neighborhood shopping centers,
hotels, the Larkspur Ferry Terminal, the future SMART Station, future high-density
development at Larkspur Landing, Marin County Mart, Sanitary District #1 and the Ferry
Terminal, and several schools. The MCBC strongly recommends that the SAP
environmental assessment includes a thorough assessment of existing
bicycle/pedestrian connectivity and safety issues and needs between the SMART
Station and destinations to the east via Sir Francis Drake Boulevard East,
including the I-580 flyover, Anderson Drive, Main Street and East Francisco
Boulevard.

West Sir Francis Drake Boulevard: Highway 101 to Wolf Grade
Under the Preferred Plan Alternative, the western extent of the Station Planning Area is
currently near Eliseo Drive/Barry Way. By limiting the focus of bicycle/pedestrian
improvements and connectivity to the defined Planning Area, the Plan fails to capture a
significant portion of western Marinâs cyclist and pedestrian community. Many cyclists
that reside or work west of Eliseo Drive/Barry Way will be commuting to the SMART
Station, the Ferry Terminal, Cal Park Tunnel, the Central Marin Ferry Connection, local
commercial areas and businesses, and beyond. Furthermore, upon build-out of Larkspur
Landing, Marin Country Mart, Sanitary District #1, the Ferry Terminal and Drakes
Landing, there will be a significantly higher demand for safe bicycle facilities between the
Planning Area and the commercial, business and recreational destinations to the west.
Additionally, numerous cyclists already utilize Wolf Grade to access these destinations
from the north and this number will only increase upon arrival of SMART and build-out of
the Station Area. Furthermore, the Bon Air Road/Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
intersection receives a significant amount of traffic and the provision of safe bicycle
facilities between the SMART Station and Bon Air Road could play a significant role in
helping to entice commuters to bike/walk to their destinations instead of driving, thereby
reducing traffic congestion at this intersection and beyond.

The Marin County Unincorporated Area Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan identifies Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard, between Highway 101 and the Town of Ross, as a special
Bikeway Study Area. This 2.1 mile segment is proposed in the Master Plan for Class II
bicycle lanes.

Therefore, the MCBC strongly requests the SAP environmental assessment
include an analysis of traffic operations and bicycle/pedestrian connectivity from
the SMART Station to at minimum, Wolf Grade to the west, in order to provide for
the current and anticipated growth of non-motorized demand to/from the Station,
businesses and commercial centers, public transit facilities, residential areas and
popular recreational destinations to the west.

Bay Trail Alignment
It has long been a MCBC intention to complete the North-South Greenway adjacent to
the eastern edge of the Station Planning Area along the current SMART Right of Way
(over Corte Madera Creek and to the south to Wornum Drive) for both transportation and
recreation purposes. MCBC has long supported a separated bridge over Corte Madera
Creek and a north/south pathway on the SMART right-of-way from Corte Madera Creek
to Wornum Drive. Because of the opportunities that became available with the design of
the Greenbrae Corridor Improvement Project, MCBC also supports the construction of a
12-foot wide bicycle/pedestrian pathway using the âbent capsâ on the Northbound Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard exit ramp that is planned as part of the Greenbrae Corridor
Improvement Project.

MCBC supports the Central Marin Ferry Connection Project study Alternative 1C
(Attachment A).This alternative provides a separated bike/pedestrian facility over Corte
Madera Creek using the bent caps and continuing through the (first) mobile home park
after touching down onto Redwood Highway (when heading south). The route then
continues along the SMART railroad corridor heading south to Wornum at Redwood
Highway. The MCBC recommends that the SAP environmental assessment
includes a feasibility assessment of the Central Marin Ferry Connection Project
study Alternative 1C as an alternative for a bicycle/pedestrian crossing of Corte
Madera Creek.

Corte Madera Creek Crossings
Please see comments on âBay Trail Alignmentâ above. The current crossings of Corte
Madera Creek along both sides of Highway 101 are too narrow to safely accommodate
current and future bicycle and pedestrian volumes. The MCBC recommends that the
SAP environmental assessment includes a discussion of alternatives for non-
motorized crossings of the west and east sides of Corte Madera Creek.


Redwood Highway North: Wornum Drive to Corte Madera Creek
The MCBC supports much needed bicycle and pedestrian improvements to Redwood
Highway North between Wornum Drive and Corte Madera Creek. Currently, this area
lacks continuous bicycle lanes and sidewalks and is of great hazard to cyclists and
pedestrians. This corridor serves as a key connector for those wishing to access the
SMART Station, Ferry Terminal, Central Marin Ferry Connection, Cal Park Tunnel, Marin
Airporter and commercial and business centers to the north from Larkspur and Corte
Madera, as well as from locations further to the south and west. This corridor also serves
as Marinâs North-South Greenway, a mostly car-free north-south bikeway extending from
Sausalito through Novato. The corridor receives a high level of existing non-motorized
commuter and recreational traffic; and upon operation of SMART and development
within and adjacent to the Station Planning Area, this corridor will be of increasing
importance to non-motorized users. Therefore, a safe and interconnected
bicycle/pedestrian network to serve current and future non-motorized needs is vitally
important throughout this corridor. The MCBC recommends that the SAP
environmental assessment includes an analysis of bicycle/pedestrian connectivity
and safety deficiencies along Redwood Highway North between Wornum Drive
and Corte Madera Creek, and provides an evaluation of alternatives to alleviate the
deficiencies identified.

West Side of Highway 101: Wornum Drive to Corte Madera Creek
The MCBC supports bicycle and pedestrian improvements to the west side of Highway
101 between Wornum Drive and Corte Madera Creek. This corridor serves as a key
connector for those wishing to access the SMART Station, Ferry Terminal, Central Marin
Ferry Connection, Cal Park Tunnel, Marin Airporter and commercial and business
centers to the north from Larkspur and Corte Madera, as well as from locations further to
the south and west. In addition, the corridor provides a direct connection to the Corte
Madera Creek Pathway for those wishing to travel westbound, including travel to the Bon
Air Shopping Center, Marin General Hospital and College of Marin. The corridor receives
a high level of existing non-motorized commuter and recreational traffic; and upon
operation of SMART and development within and adjacent to the Station Planning Area,
this corridor will be of increasing importance to non-motorized users. Therefore, a safe
and interconnected bicycle/pedestrian network to serve current and future non-motorized
needs is vitally important throughout this corridor. The MCBC recommends that the
SAP environmental assessment includes an analysis of alternatives for provision
of a Class I multi-use pathway along the west side of Highway 101 between
Wornum Drive and Corte Madera Creek.

Separated from Traffic Crossing of Highway 101/SAPâs Relation to Greenbrae
Corridor Improvement Project
At the same time that this Plan is being developed, the Transportation Authority of Marin,
in partnership with and Caltrans, has been developing the design plans and
environmental assessment for the Twin Cities Greenbrae Corridor Improvement Project
(GCIP), which calls for the removal of the bicycle/pedestrian overcrossing of Hwy 101 at
Lucky Drive, without plans for replacement. Under the current design, the GCIP will
reroute bicycle/pedestrian traffic needing to cross Highway 101 under the freeway via
Wornum Drive. Cyclists and pedestrians using Wornum will be forced to navigate
numerous lanes of heavy traffic, including multiple on/off-ramps. The planned Wornum
Drive route will include crossing multiple right turn lanes, and in some cases double right
turn lanes, which are notoriously dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians. The removal of
this existing bike/ped overcrossing will undoubtedly affect bicycle/pedestrian
connectivity, safety, and perceived safety within and adjacent to the SMART Station
Planning Area. Therefore, itâs imperative that the environmental assessment for the
SMART Station Area Plan takes into account the impacts that the removal of the
overcrossing and the subsequent rerouting of bicycle/pedestrian traffic onto the
dangerous and highly congested Wornum Drive will have on bike/pedestrian circulation
within and adjacent to the Station Plan Area.

The removal of the overcrossing will result in the division of the local community without
providing a friendly and "attractive" crossing point. This project is inconsistent with
policies from the General Plans of Larkspur, Corte Madera and the County of Marin with
regards to fostering connectivity within and between communities and between the east
and west sides of the freeway. It also conflicts with policies and goals that encourage an
increase in bicycle/pedestrian mode shift, including the Marin Countywide Planâs goal of
20 percent of all trips in Marin to be made by walking or biking by 2020. The existing
overcrossing is heavily used by many local residents and it is also an important part of
Marinâs North-South Greenway, a mostly car-free north-south bikeway extending from
Sausalito through Novato. The MCBC strongly requests that the SAP environmental
assessment includes an evaluation of not only the current bicycle/pedestrian
transportation conditions, but also an evaluation of future bike/pedestrian
transportation needs and impacts that will result from construction of the GCIP,
given the projectâs current design.

Application of a Pedestrian Environmental Quality Index
We urge the City of Larkspur to consider the application of a Pedestrian Environmental
Quality Index (PEQI) when evaluating solutions for getting people safely across Highway
101 and through the Station Planning Area. Many of the intersections within the Planning
Area represent typical routes pedestrians and bicyclists use to access nearby public
transit, parks, schools, essential goods, and surrounding neighborhoods. Overall,
existing conditions at the project area suggest substantial traffic hazards for pedestrians
and bicyclists, both for area residents walking and bicycling to adjacent neighborhood
amenities and for people coming to the project area via non-motorized means.
Application of a PEQI, originally developed by the San Francisco Department of Public
Health (SFDPH) in 2008 and now used nationwide, should be included as part of the
study of intersection operating conditions.

The environmental assessment should evaluate existing conditions for pedestrian and
bicycle safety and the cumulative effects on pedestrian and bicycle hazards and collision
frequencies in the project area. The PEQI should quantify street and intersection factors
empirically known to affect people's travel behaviors and be organized into the typical
five categories: intersection safety, traffic, street design, land use and perceived safety.
Within these categories should be 31 indicators that reflect the quality of the built
environment for pedestrians which should comprise the survey used for data collection.
SFDPH has aggregated these indicators to create a weighted summary index, which can
be reported as an overall index. Table 1 indicates how the indicators fit into the broader
domains of pedestrian comfort and security.

The discussion of baseline conditions should include data on pedestrian-vehicle
collisions in the project area. In addition to assessing where new resident
populations will be introduced and their potential pedestrian routes, providing a
map of the location of pedestrian-vehicle collisions in the project area over the
past 10 years would be helpful in identifying high hazard locations that could
benefit from focused pedestrian design efforts. The environmental assessment
should also consider how improvements in the pedestrian environment in the
area may be feasible and provide appropriate mitigations.

The MCBC requests that the SAP environmental assessment includes the
application of a Pedestrian Environmental Quality Index based on the
alternatives presented in order to ensure a safe, inviting and user-friendly
bicycle/pedestrian environment within the Planning Area.

Thank you for your careful consideration of our comments.

Re:     Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan
        Response to Notice of Preparation INOP] of EIR

My response concerns transportation and circulation only. Until the chalJenges
raised ty traffiC transit, anilnon-motorized transporters have been resolved" no
other isiues, including the design and placement of buildings, can be addressed
satisfactorily.

The area of the Larkspur SMART Station plan is tightly constrained - by steep hills,
by waterfront, and by u.s. 101 and sir Francis Drake Boulevard.

Given these constraints, the only way to achieve higher-density is to construct
                                                                                taller
buildings. Higher density means more people will be living  working    and shopping
at Larkipur Landing. Most of them will have cars. However, as time passes, and as
additional higher-denslty construction occurs beyond Larkspur Landing, but near iL
there wiil not be enough-space to accommodate all these additional vehicles on the
roadways and in parking lots. The inevitable outcome will be massive gridlock.

See   list of new developments [actual, planned, discussedJ attached as Exhibit "A'"

SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS:

I find it discouragtng to hear so much analysis of parking lot capacity, when we
should be concentruring on the relief of traffic congestion on East Sir Francis Drake'
Parking availability will only encourage driving into the area' We need to move
beyonjour l-950'i-era focus on cars and turn our thoughts to the future, guided by
SB 375 and worries about the effects of climate change'




As  with the new residences, offices and shops, the only way to accommodate
increased transportation volumes will be to build up. Heavy traffic, i'e' motor
vehicles, should continue to use existing roadways, but light-weight transporters,

pleasant place to walk, and while pedestrians may access it from the CMFCP, if
walking ir to bu encouraged there should be equal access near its eastern end.
Many r-esidents in the area, and in the Bon Air Center/South Eliseo area, are older

its own recreational walkway by the water.

Re NOP for EIR Scope, Larkspur SMART Station Area Plan(SAP)

Neal,
Please include these questions in the EIR for the SMART SAP.
Thank you!

1) Circulation SAP
This is the hub of the regional network. Within the narrow scope of the plan area, including Redwood
Highway North, how can the plan make sure to accommodate all users accessing that area and that
station by bike? On foot? By bus? What routes provide the conflict-free and fast connectivity within the
area connecting to downtown Larkspur? To all major employment centers and likely destinations for the
60% of arriving users who are going to jobs, shopping and business in Central Marin? To the minority
40% going on to San Francisco by bus or ferry per the ridership studies?
Where will users coming to employment in Marin store their bicycles near the station overnight? Many
may choose to store a car overnight near the station and take SMART rather than drive and sit in the
demoralizing traffic jam coming south from Sonoma County that occurs every single morning. How can
they best be encouraged to store a bike overnight instead of a car to reduce traffic capacity?Â  Could a
locked roofed secure bike parking shelter for 300 bikes be built near the corner of Larkspur Landing
Circle on 4 spaces of Airporter Land central to ferry and train and Airporter? What will be the impact of
not providing ample secure overnight bike parking?
Where will train users coming south store their cars overnight near the station? What will be the impact
of that?
The fastest route to downtown Larkspur by bike and on foot is via the Pedestrian Overcrossing (POC) at
Lucky drive: what can the SAP do to ensure that this fastest route remains accessible to SMART users,
and is made ADA compliant? The route crossing under 101 north of the creek to the westside bridge is
3/4 miles from the RR ROW at SFD to Lucky Dr versus 1/2 mile from the RR ROW/SFD to Lucky Dr via
Redwood Hwy and the Lucky POC.
Can SMART ask the GCIP/CALTRANS and TAM to meet SMART's needs for connectivity since the POC is
within the Plan area and is critical for reducing traffic congestion by cars within the station area.
Can Larkspur ask the GCIP the same?
What changes can be made to code so that all new residential structures will build bicycle parking and
pathway access and sidewalks to encourage reduced car use? Likewise code changes to require bicycle
parking for all new businesses and hotels?
Can code be changed to offer housing with only 1 or some units with no car parking space at a reduced
rate?
What kind of bicycle map could be provided to SAP users showing times by bike at 10mph speed and by
foot at 3mph speed on each of the regional multi use paths(MUP) connecting to the station area to
destinations within 15 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes to educate and encourage area users to
walk or bike rather than driving cars out of or into the station area, since traffic is already at or near
capacity much of the day? At 10mph where could a user get from the station by bike on the MUP in
going to work in 15 minutes? Where a walker? I think the Sonoma County train riders will be super
motivated to get to their destinations by any means because of the misery of the drive they will be
avoiding. Can we ask them if they will walk or ride a bike at this terminus and how much time they
would be willing to spend getting the distance from the train to their employment or other destinations?
Where are their jobs in Central Marin? Are they close enough to get to in a 15 minute bike ride? A 15
minute walking trip? What can be done to make those trips better? What can be done to maximize the
distance train riders are able to travel in that 15 minute time amount?
What impact would reducing cars by 300 and bike/walking trips have on capacity? Would it allow for
more TOD housing units? The area is very attractive and will likely be desired by large numbers of
seniors downsizing from big Marin houses; under supply will likely be a problem.
What aspects of the planned bicycle and pedestrian paths will be under FEMA's new 9' 100 year flood
line? What will happen to the circulation during more frequentÂ  times of increased flooding with climate
change?
Where does BCDC's 16" increase by 2050 flood line fall in the station area and connecting to the
MUPaths users will be accessing on bike or foot from the train? From the ferry? In Redwood Highway
area?
What would be the flooded condition advantage for SAP circulation of continuing the CMFC elevated
above flooding across Corte Madera Creek and south on the SMART RR ROW?
How will fire-trucks and safety services circulate during high water conditions?
What can be done to make the Larkspur Landing area less isolated? The Redwood Highway area less
isolated?Â  Can Larkspur support building a recreational trail on the levees behind Redwood Highway
North?
Station to ferry bike/ped access is currently planned via parking lots which provide numerous conflict
points and are unsafe. What is the time to arrive from station platform to ferry entrance via this
planned route? Would it be better and financially possible to make a dedicated stairs and path separate
from cars between the Airporter and back of the Cinema building to the street from near the end of the
top of the "U" ramp of the Cal Park path directly down to Larkspur Landing Circle(LLC), then continue
on the street to the corner at the south corner of the Airporter, and a new crosswalk across LLC, then
to the SFD pedestrian signal and on to the ferry?Â  I walked this route and found it took 5.5 minutes.
The planned route is circuitous via the shopping center and took 7.5 minutes; it is longer. Walkers tend
to take the shortest path; what would it cost to build this route for walkers? What impacts would a
faster walking path from station platform to ferry have on the SAP, and could it make shuttles or special
bridges or moving the station to the ferry less attractive in cost/benefit ratio?
The SMART plan is a pathway as well as train. Once the pathway segments to the north are connected
by SMART, do we know how many more bicyclists will come and go via the SAP area? What will be the
impact if many recreational riders and tourists come by bike and ferry from San Francisco to go north
on the train and path?Â  Do the planned routes adequately serve numerous tourists coming north or
Ballpark bound fans heading south from the Airporter/SMART parking lots?
What would be the impact on car traffic on East SFD, and can Larkspur work with GCIP/Caltrans to
request this, to rename all "Richmond Bridge" signs on 101 NB as "East Sir Francis Drake?" Sausalito
did similarly a number of years ago with "Alexander Ave" and successfully cut congestion on Bridgeway.
Can housing density figures be tied to traffic capacity such that incentives are built in to pay for non-car
features and thus make room for desired densities?
With good advance planning for circulation for all modes of users besides cars, we have a chance to
fulfill the dream of walkable neighborhoods, attractive transit oriented high density housing, and
regional travelers. Without careful attention to connectivity for multimodal users we will have traffic at
capacity, reduced air quality, increased greenhouse gas emissions and increasing contributions to
climate change.

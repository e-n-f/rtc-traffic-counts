Lauderdale based teams. This distribution of teams provides flexibility as needed to efficiently cover the northern
portion of District One with the Orlando study teams and the southern portion of District One with the Ft.
Lauderdale study teams.
Traffic Data Collection Staff
From previous project experiences, the KAI team recognizes the seasonal traffic characteristics of the counties
served by District One. This includes a peak season of traffic roughly covering the time span of early January to
Easter. Within these couple of months, the state highway system within District One experiences the highest traffic
volume levels annually and is the preferred time for traffic data collection. In response to meeting these traffic
data collection needs for District One, the KAI team includes four traffic data collection firms. The combined
resources of the four firms provide vast amounts of traffic data collection capabilities to District One for this project.
A summary of these resources is provided in Table 1.

Through this task order based contract, District One is seeking a consultant to provide traffic operational studies for
both Study Type I (Signal Warrant Analysis) and Study Type II (Composite Study). The consultant’s
recommendations will be used by District One to develop traffic operational improvement projects to be included in
the Department’s work program.

approach or 5 vehicle-hours for a two-lane minor street approach.
STUDY TYPE II – COMPOSITE STUDY
Composite studies give District One the flexibility of conducting one or more of up to twenty two (22) different
tasks to help solve a variety of traffic problems. The required task(s) will be determined by District One and the
KAI team working together to develop a study design suitable for applying towards a particular traffic problem. The
different task types available in this study type can be grouped as follows :
Traffic Data Collection Tasks (Tasks A-I, P, Q, & U)
The KAI team’s four data collection firms are experienced with collecting the
different types of traffic data required in this study type and formatting it in a
manner that is desired by District One. This includes the collection of 8 &
12-hour TMCs, 24-hour approach counts, 7-day continuous traffic counts,
pedestrian group sizes, 8-hour ped-bike counts, vehicle gap sizes, delay
studies (including left turn and intersection), spot speed studies (with and
without travel times), and no-passing zone studies.
All tasks requiring traffic data collection will be performed in accordance with the procedures and standard forms
provided in the FDOT MUTS manual. In addition, traffic data collection will be performed at appropriate times to
include typical weekday (Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday) unless otherwise required and not performed during
adverse weather conditions or when the intersection is within a construction zone.

Other Data Collection and Analysis Tasks (Tasks J-M & R-T)
In addition to traffic data collection, several of the required tasks involve the
collection of other types of data such as field inventories of existing
conditions (including traffic signal inventories), crash data (using the FDOT
Safety Office’s Crash Analysis Reporting System), peak period traffic
observations during Qualitative Assessments, intersection analyses, and
corridor reviews. This type of data will be collected by one or more
transportation professionals on the KAI team in a manner that is consistent

with District One policies and in conformance with the procedures and standard forms
provided in the FDOT MUTS manual.

KAI is nationally recognized in the areas of Highway Capacity and Safety. As the Prime
Contractor for preparing the 1st Edition Highway Safety Manual and Highway Capacity
Manual 2010, KAI provides detailed understanding of the procedures and
methodologies for conducting safety and operational analyses. Although the tasks
performed under the district-wide Traffic Operations Studes contract is not commonly
geared toward performing detailed operational or safety analysis, the KAI Teams in-
depth understanding of these topics translates into an awareness of the data quantity,
quality, and breadth that is needed to support future analyses by the Department.

Recommendation and Report Preparation Tasks (Tasks N-O, V)
Under Task N and O, the KAI team will develop and analyze the data collected in other tasks and provide short term
and, as needed, long term recommendations to District One. Where an improvement is needed, KAI will provide
recommendations that are implementable and best address the defined issue. The study will be documented in a
written report for District One’s use in programming the recommendated improvement(s). As prime consultant,
KAI will manage all work conducted by sub-consultants under Task V.

                                                      Innovative Traffic Data Collection Concept
                                                        In addition to traditional data collection capabilities, the KAI
                                                        team will also be able to apply innovation to traffic data

The camera’s batteries and memory cards have the capability to collect a large amount of turning movement data at
a location with the digital cameras recording up to 18 hours on a single memory card. In addition to the cameras
having fast and easy deployment, Quality Counts can collect turning movement data at a large number of
intersections on the same time that 7-day approach counts are also being collected, if desired.

APPROACH TO QUALITY CONTROL
KAI’s Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program will be administered by Mr. Jack Freeman, P.E.,
PTOE Through his nearly 40 years of experience, Mr. Freeman brings extensive experience in FDOT traffic
operational studies and is very familiar with the procedures contained within the FDOT MUTS manual for Study
Types I and II.
As the administrator of KAI’s QA/QC program, Mr. Freeman will perform a thorough review of all task order
deliverables prior to submittal. He will collaborate with Mr. Braud and the Study Team Leaders prior to his
reviews to gain a complete understanding of the District One’s needs and objectives for each study. During his
QA/QC reviews, Mr. Freeman will be reviewing the study deliverables from both a technical content and
presentation perspective. He will confirm that the technical content is in conformance with District One
preferences, statewide guidance as provided in FDOT’s MUTS manual, and national guidance provided in the
MUTCD, HCM, or other documents as required. In addition, Mr. Freeman will review the presentation of the
technical content within each study deliverable to determine if data in graphs, tables, or diagrams is being presented
in a manner that will be clear and understandable to the reader.

Signal Warrant Analysis
SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue
                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the findings of a signal warrant analysis at the intersection of SR
976/Bird Road and SW 69th Avenue, located in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The signal
warrant analysis conducted for the study intersection identified that there is just cause for
concern regarding the existing traffic/safety conditions at the intersection. The following is a
summary of the pertinent findings:

   1. An analysis of the intersection safety ratio indicated that this location did not
      experience an abnormally high crash rate. However, 16 of the 42 crashes between
      2007 and 2010 were angle crashes suggesting a potential safety concern with regard to
      the northbound-to-westbound left-turn movement from SW 69th Avenue.
   2. Occasionally, a westbound vehicle(s) waiting to make a left-turn from SR 976/Bird
      Road to travel south on SW 69th Avenue blocked or conflicted with a vehicle(s)
      intending to make a left-turn from the south leg of SW 69th Avenue to travel west on
      SR 976/Bird Road, and vice versa. This conflict resulted from vehicles waiting for
      gaps in eastbound traffic.
   3. Limited sight-distance exists on the south leg of SW 69th Avenue when looking west.
      This is due to the elevation of the road west of the intersection at the old railroad
      crossing as well as shrubs in the southwest quadrant.
   4. Notable delay is experienced by motorists making a northbound left turn during the
      AM peak hour. A delay study for the northbound and westbound left turn movements
      was conducted, with the results as follows:
         Westbound left-turn AM =                 24.9 secs/veh (LOS C)
         Westbound left-turn PM =                 16.8 secs/veh (LOS C)
         Northbound left turn AM =                49.3 secs/veh (LOS E)
         Northbound left turn PM =                40.1 secs/veh (LOS E)
   5. Three of the eight warrants outlined in Section 4C of the Manual of Uniform Traffic
      Control Devices (MUTCD), 2003 Edition were analyzed for the study intersection.
      Based on the traffic counts collected for this study, none of the warrants are met.
      Although the intersection experienced a significant number of crashes (angle and left-
      turn) that could be relieved by the installation of a signal, Warrant No. 7, the crash
      experience was not satisfied because the volumes did not meet the warrant thresholds
      and there are no documented measures taken to improve the crash experience at the
      intersection.
Based on the findings of the qualitative assessment and signal warrant analysis conducted at
the intersection of SR 976/Bird Road and SW 69th Avenue, a signal is not warranted nor
recommended at this time. However, to improve traffic operations and safety at the
intersection, it is recommended to limit the turning movements at the intersection to right-in,
right-out, and left-in operation only. This recommendation essentially removes the
northbound and southbound left-turn and through movements, however these movements can
be served through U-turns at median openings that are located at SW 68th Avenue
(approximately 500 feet to the east) and at SW 71st Avenue (approximately 700 feet to the

west). Alternatively, motorists can also access SR 976/Bird Road through the signalized
intersection of Bird Road and SW 67th Avenue, which is approximately 0.24 miles to the east.
To prevent northbound or southbound vehicles from making an illegal left-turn, construct a
channelized right-turn on both approach legs of SW 69th Avenue. It may also be necessary to
extend the median on both approach legs of SR 976/Bird Road to further prevent motorists
from making a northbound or southbound left-turn movement.
Additionally, to enhance northbound motorists’ line of sight of eastbound approaching
vehicles, it is recommended that the Florida Department of Transportation work with the Post
Office to remove or trim the shrubs located on the south side of SR 976/Bird Road,
immediately west of SW 69th Avenue.

Signal Warrant Analysis
SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue

1.0    INTRODUCTION
Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) conducted a signal warrant analysis at the intersection of
SR 976/Bird Road and SW 69th Avenue, located in Miami-Dade County, Florida to determine
if a traffic signal should be installed at this intersection. It should be noted that KAI
conducted a signal warrant analysis for this same intersection in 2006. The findings of that
study concluded that a traffic signal was not warranted but did make a recommendation to
convert the median opening to directional, thus prohibiting the left-turn movements from SW
69th Avenue. Since that time, the intersection configuration has remained the same.
Therefore, this study was conducted to reassess the need for a traffic signal at the study
intersection. Figure 1 illustrates the relative location of the study intersection to major
roadways in the area. Figure 2 shows an aerial view of the study area.


2.0    EXISTING CONDITIONS
A site inventory was conducted on Wednesday, June 15, 2011 to identify the existing
intersection characteristics and conditions within the surrounding area. The condition diagram
prepared for the study intersection is provided as Figure 2.

2.1   Intersection Geometry
SR 976/Bird Road currently intersects SW 69th Avenue to form an unsignalized intersection
with both the northbound and southbound approaches operating under STOP control. The
lane configurations at the intersection are shown in Figure 3. The south approach of SW 69th
Avenue is offset approximately 80 feet east of the north approach. The study location is on
flat terrain.

2.3   Pavement Condition and Markings
Based on the field visit, it was apparent that there had been recent subsurface work on SR
976/Bird Road. As a result, the pavement had areas with new asphalt patching. Despite the
patching, the pavement was in relatively good condition. The pavement markings on SR
976/Bird Road appeared to be in good condition while the pavement markings on SW 69th
Avenue were worn. It appears that the northwest quadrant of the intersection has evidence of
standing water, while the right (east) shoulder on the south approach of SW 69th Avenue is
deteriorated to gravel.

2.4   Adjacent Land Uses
The following is a summary of the land-uses in the vicinity of the intersection:
   Commercial land uses are located in the northeast quadrant of the intersection.
   A Wendy’s fast food restaurant and strip mall is located in the southeast quadrant of the
   intersection.
   The US Post Office (Ludlam Branch) is located in the southwest quadrant of the
   intersection.
   A car wash is located in the northwest quadrant of the intersection.
   A railroad crossing was located across Bird Road approximately 250 feet west of the
   south leg of SW 69th Avenue, but was removed within the past four years.

2.5   Traffic Control
The intersection of SR 976/Bird Road and SW 69th Avenue is unsignalized. The nearest
signalized intersection in the vicinity of the intersection is at SR 976/Bird Road and SW 67th
Avenue approximately 1,250 feet to the east, and at SR 976/Bird Road at SW 72nd Avenue
approximately 1,400 feet to the west.

2.6   Traffic Operations
Traffic operations were observed at the intersection on Wednesday, June 15, 2011 during the
morning (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and afternoon (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) peak periods,
respectively. The following is a summary of the observations made in the field:

General observations:
1. Vehicles appeared to be traveling within the 40 mph speed limit along SR 976/Bird Road.
2. The location of the post office driveways (shown in Figure 2) and parking lot
   configuration promotes motorists to exit the property directly onto SR 976/Bird Road
   immediately west of the study intersection.
3. A wide median (approximately 22 feet wide) provides refuge to vehicles that travel
   to/from SW 69th Avenue through the intersection. This allows vehicles to employ two-
   stage gap acceptance.
4. Downstream median openings allowing vehicles to perform U-turns are located at SW
   68th Avenue (approximately 500 feet to the east), and at SW 71st Avenue (approximately

5. Occasionally, a vehicle(s) waiting to make a left-turn from SR 976/Bird Road blocked and
   interfered with a vehicle(s) making a left-turn from the south leg of SW 69th Avenue, and

SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue
   vice versa. This conflict resulted from vehicles waiting for gaps in eastbound traffic. This
   scenario is shown in Figure 8.
6. Limited sight-distance exists on the south leg of SW 69th Avenue when looking west.
   This is due to the elevation of the road west of the intersection at the old railroad crossing
   as well as shrubs in the southwest quadrant. Figure 9 shows the view from the driver side
   of the vehicle.
7. Low pedestrian and bicycle activity was observed in the vicinity of the intersection.

SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue
AM Peak Period (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM)
  1. The majority of vehicles on SR 976/Bird Road traveled eastbound.
  2. The maximum queue observed on the south approach of SW 69th Avenue was six
     vehicles. This queue cleared relatively quickly by gaps created from the upstream
     signal at SR 976/Bird Road and SW 72nd Avenue, located approximately 0.26 miles to
     the west.


PM Peak Period (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM)
  1. The majority of vehicles on SR 976/Bird Road traveled westbound.
  2. From approximately 5:15 PM to 6:00 PM, westbound traffic queued back from the SR
     826/Palmetto Road ramp terminals through the intersection and past the Bird
     Road/SW 67th Avenue intersection as shown in Figure 10.
  3. Because of the consistent westbound queue resulting in slow vehicle speeds, turning
     vehicles from the south leg of SW 69th Avenue were able to maneuver into the queue
     on SR 976/Bird Road. However, at the same, there were instances where an
     eastbound left-turn vehicle could not make the maneuver. As the left-turning vehicle
     waited in the median, both northbound and southbound left-turning vehicles competed
     with the eastbound left-turning vehicle for a gap in westbound traffic.

2.7     Pedestrian and Bicycle Activity
2.7.1 Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
The following summarizes the pedestrian and bicycle facilities at the intersection:
      Sidewalks are present along both sides of SR 976/Bird Road and on the south leg of SW
      69th Avenue. A short sidewalk segment also exists on the west side of the north leg of SW
      69th Avenue extending approximately 170 feet back from SR 976/Bird Road.
      There are no bicycle lanes in the study vicinity
      Few bicyclist and pedestrians were observed during the peak periods.

2.7.2 Pedestrian Observations
Low pedestrian activity was observed in the vicinity of the intersection during both peak
periods. Pedestrian counts were also included as part of the manual turning movement counts
summarized in Appendix B.



3.0      TRAFFIC COUNTS
For purposes of conducting the signal warrant analysis, it was necessary to obtain eight-hour
turning movement counts at the study intersection. For the purposes of identifying the hours
for which the turning movement counts were to be conducted, roadway segment volumes
were first obtained for all four approaches of the intersection. Based on a review of the
segment volumes, eight-hour manual turning movement counts (TMCs) were then conducted
on Tuesday, June 14, 2011 during the morning (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.), mid-day (12:00 p.m.
to 3:00 p.m.), and afternoon (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) peak periods, respectively. It should be
noted that the turning movement counts were conducted on the same day as the roadway
segment counts. This was possible because video cameras were setup at the intersection at
the same time as the roadway segment counts. Upon review of the segment data, the data
collection firm was then directed to review the video for the eight hours identified above to
identify the turning movement data. The turning movement count showed that the a.m. peak
hour is from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., the mid-day peak hour is from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.,
and the afternoon peak hour is from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. Detailed results from the roadway
segment counts are provided in Appendix A. Detailed results of the turning movement
counts are shown in Appendix B and summarized in Table 1.

4.0      CRASH SUMMARY
Crash data for the four-year period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2010 were
obtained from the FDOT. The data collected was used to prepare Collision Diagrams and
Crash Summary Reports for the location (see Appendix C).

A crash summary for the years 2007 through 2010 is presented in Table 2. During the
intersection field review, no skid marks or debris that could be attributed to a vehicle crash
was observed in or around the intersection.

Table 2 also shows calculations for the test factor at the location for each of the three years
2007 through 2009. Because statewide average crash rates are not available for 2010, a 2010
test factor could not be calculated. The test factor determines the confidence that the study
location is not a High Crash Location when compared to similar locations throughout the
State. The test factor is calculated from the following relationships:


                                                              1

Where:

         ACR = Actual crash rate for the study location (crashes per million vehicles
               entering)
         AVG = Statewide average crash rate for the category of highway being tested
               (crashes per million vehicles entering)
         M   = Average vehicle exposure spot (million vehicles entering)
         K   = Test factor

Signal Warrant Analysis
SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue
The test factors computed for years 2007, 2008, and 2009 were -1.166, -0.226, and -1.479,
respectively. Based on the cumulative standard normal distribution curve, these test factors
correspond to confidence levels of 7.0% for year 2007, 41.1% for year 2008, and 12.2% for
year 2009. The test factor averaged over the three-years was computed at -0.957 (computed
using average values for the variables in the test factor equation) – this corresponds to a
confidence level of 20.1%. The results indicate that over these three years, this location did
not experience an abnormally high crash rate as compared to similar locations statewide
(detailed calculations of the safety ratios are located in Appendix C).

Collision diagrams (2007 through 2010) for the intersection are shown in Figure 11 through
Figure 14. Based on a review of the collision diagrams and the crash summary, 15 of the 42
crashes were angle crashes, suggesting a potential safety concern with regard to the
northbound left-turn movement.

5.0     DELAY STUDY
An intersection delay study was conducted in accordance with the procedures established in
the Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies (MUTS). JAMAR TDC-8 counters were used to
efficiently collect, calculate and print the intersection approach delay data. The intersection
study was conducted during the AM peak hour and PM peak hour as determined from traffic
counts. Delay data was collected for the westbound left-turn movement and the northbound
left-turn movement. Results from the delay study are summarized in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, the average delays per vehicle for the westbound approach (westbound
to southbound left-turn movement) during the AM and PM peak hours were 24.9 seconds and
16.8 seconds, respectively. These delays both translate Level of Service (LOS) C in
accordance with Exhibit 17-2 of the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 Edition. The average
delay per vehicle for the northbound approach (northbound to westbound left-turn movement)
during the AM and PM peak hours were 49.3 seconds and 40.1 seconds, respectively. These
delays both translate LOS E in accordance with Exhibit 17-2 of the Highway Capacity
Manual 2010. The Florida Department of Transportation’s 2009 Quality/Level of Service
Handbook specifies operating LOS D as the minimum level of service standard for
intersections operating in an urban environment. Therefore, the results indicate that the
westbound left-turn movement operates within FDOT’s adopted LOS standard whereas the
northbound left-turn movement does not operate within the adopted LOS standard.

SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue


6.0    SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS
The signal warrant analysis for the intersection was conducted by completing the Traffic
Signal Warrant Summary forms taken from the FDOT Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies
(MUTS). The Traffic Signal Warrant Summary Forms provide a useful tool for evaluating
signal warrants. The eight warrants conform to the warrants established by the Federal
Highway Administration that are documented in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD), 2003 Edition.

The MUTS requires that a traffic signal should not be installed unless one or more of the eight
warrants are satisfied. However, because the warrants are based on minimum requirements,
satisfaction of a warrant does not necessarily provide justification or a mandate for installing a
new traffic signal. Delay, congestion, safety considerations, confusion, or other evidence of
the need for a signal should also be considered.

The MUTCD provides a 30% reduction in the minimum vehicular volume requirements for
Warrants 1, 2, and 3 when either (1) the 85-percentile speed of the major street exceeds 40
mph in either an urban or rural area, or (2) when the intersection lies within the built-up area
of an isolated community having a population of less than 10,000. Given that the posted
speed limit for SR 976/Bird Road is 40 mph, no reduction in minimum vehicular volume was
applied in evaluating Warrants 1, 2, and 3.

The signal warrant analysis was conducted using traffic data for the typical weekday.
Because the both the northbound and southbound right-turn movements have dedicated lanes
which allow the vehicles to make right turns with minimal delay, right turn vehicles were
excluded from the warrant analysis, and the minor street was treated as a one-lane approach.
The results from the warrant analysis are briefly discussed below.

A signal warrant analysis was conducted to determine if the installation of a traffic signal is
warranted. The signal warrant analysis is based on the methodology presented in the
MUTCD, 2003 Edition. This methodology provides guidance to traffic engineers when
determining if a traffic signal should be installed or removed. The warrant analysis considers
traffic volume, crash experience, and the effects of a signal on progression and the
transportation system. The following is a summary of the signal warrant analysis by Warrant
number, while Figure 15 through Figure 19 provide the details of the signal warrant analysis.

Warrant No. 1 – Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 1 covers the eight-hour vehicular volume warrant conditions. The Minimum
Vehicular Volume, Condition A is intended where a large volume of intersecting traffic is the
principal reason to consider installing a traffic signal. The Interruption of Continuous Traffic,
Condition B is intended where traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that traffic on a
minor intersecting street suffers excessive delay or conflict in entering or crossing the major
street. The data collected revealed that the study intersection does not exceed the threshold
for Warrant 1 in Condition A (Minimum Vehicular Volume) or Warrant 1 in Condition B
(Interruption of Continuous Traffic). Therefore, based on the observed traffic volumes, the
warrant is not met.

Warrant No. 2 – Four-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 2, the four-hour vehicular volume warrant is generally applied where the volume of
intersecting traffic is the primary reason for the consideration of a traffic signal. For the
warrant to be met, there must be at least four hours in which a plot of the highest minor street
volume against the combined major street volume falls above the curve approximated by the
warrant threshold shown in Figure 16. Based on the observed traffic volumes, this warrant
is not met.

Warrant No. 3 – Peak Hour Warrant
Warrant 3 is intended for peak traffic flows associated with manufacturing facilities, office
complexes, and other facilities that attract or discharge high volumes of vehicles over a short
period of time. Warrant No. 3 was considered not applicable to this study.

Warrant No. 4 – Pedestrian Volume
The pedestrian volume warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on the
major street is so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major
street. Field observations indicated that pedestrians do not experience delay crossing SR
976/Bird Road. Therefore, Warrant No. 4 was considered not applicable to this study.

Warrant No. 5 – School Crossing
The School Crossing signal warrant is intended for application where the fact that school
children cross the major street is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control
signal. Warrant No. 5 was considered not applicable to this study.

Warrant No.6 – Coordinated Signal System
Warrant No. 6 is applicable when progressive movement in a coordinated system necessitates
installing a traffic signal in order to maintain proper platooning of vehicles. Warrant No. 6
was considered not applicable to this study.

Warrant No. 7 – Crash Experience
The crash experience warrant is intended for application where the severity and frequency of
crashes are the principal reasons to consider installing a traffic signal. Warrant No. 7 is
applicable for this study based on the abnormally high crash rates experienced at the
intersection. Warrant No. 7 requires three conditions to be satisfied:
   1.      Crash Experience
   2.      Traffic volumes meet minimum 80% requirement for Warrant 1.
   3.      Trial of other alternative remedial measures.
The analysis shows that the crash experience is satisfied, however, the traffic volume
criteria are not satisfied and trials of other alternative remedial measures have not
occurred. Therefore, this warrant is not met.

SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue
Warrant No. 8 – Roadway Network
Warrant No. 8 is appropriate where installing a traffic signal might be justified to encourage
concentration and organization of traffic flow on a roadway network. Warrant No. 8 is not
applicable to this study.

Signal Warrant Analysis
SR 976/Bird Road at SW 69th Avenue

7.0    ACCESS MANAGEMENT
The existing Access Management Classification for SR 976/Bird Road is a Class 5. This
classification consists of 660-foot minimum directional median opening spacing and 1,320-
foot minimum full median opening spacing. The required minimum signal spacing is 0.25
miles. The distance between the existing signals in the vicinity of SR 976/Bird Road and SW
69th Avenue is 0.5 miles. The intersection of Bird Road and SW 72nd Avenue is
approximately 0.26 miles to the west, while the intersection of Bird Road and SW 67th
Avenue is approximately 0.24 miles to the east.


8.0    CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings of the qualitative assessment and signal warrant analysis at the SR
976/Bird Road and SW 69th Avenue intersection, the following conclusions were made:
   1. An analysis of the intersection safety ratio indicated that this location did not
      experience an abnormally high crash rate. However, 15 of the 42 crashes between
      2007 and 2010 were angle crashes suggesting a potential safety concern with regard to
      the northbound-to-westbound left-turn movement from SW 69th Avenue.
   2. Occasionally, a westbound vehicle(s) waiting to make a left-turn from SR 976/Bird
      Road to travel south on SW 69th Avenue blocked or conflicted with a vehicle(s)
      intending to make a left-turn from the south leg of SW 69th Avenue to travel west on
      SR 976/Bird Road, and vice versa. This conflict resulted from vehicles waiting for
      gaps in eastbound traffic.
   3. Limited sight-distance exists on the south leg of SW 69th Avenue when looking west.
      This is due to the elevation of the road west of the intersection at the old railroad
      crossing as well as shrubs in the southwest quadrant.
   4. Notable delay is experienced by motorists making a northbound left turn during the
      AM peak hour. A delay study for the northbound and westbound left turn movements
      was conducted, with the results as follows:
         Westbound left-turn AM =                 24.9 secs/veh (LOS C)
         Westbound left-turn PM =                 16.8 secs/veh (LOS C)
         Northbound left turn AM =                49.3 secs/veh (LOS E)
         Northbound left turn PM =                40.1 secs/veh (LOS E)

   5. Three of the eight warrants outlined in Section 4C of the MUTCD, 2003 Edition were
      analyzed for the study intersection. Based on the traffic counts collected for this
      study, none of the warrants are met. Although the intersection experienced a
      significant number of crashes (angle and left-turn) that could be relieved by the
      installation of a signal, Warrant No. 7, the crash experience was not satisfied because
      the volumes did not meet the warrant thresholds and there are no documented
      measures taken to improve the crash experience at the intersection.
Based on the findings of the qualitative assessment and signal warrant analysis conducted at
the intersection of SR 976/Bird Road and SW 69th Avenue, a signal is not warranted nor
recommended at this time. However, to improve traffic operations and safety at the

intersection, it is recommended to limit the turning movements at the intersection to right-in,
right-out, and left-in operation only. This recommendation essentially removes the
northbound and southbound left-turn and through movements, however these movements can
be served through U-turns at median openings that are located at SW 68th Avenue
(approximately 500 feet to the east) and at SW 71st Avenue (approximately 700 feet to the
west). Alternatively, motorists can also access SR 976/Bird Road through the signalized
intersection of Bird Road and SW 67th Avenue, which is approximately 0.24 miles to the east.
To prevent northbound or southbound vehicles from making an illegal left-turn, construct a
channelized right-turn on both approach legs of SW 69th Avenue. It may also be necessary to
extend the median on both approach legs of SR 976/Bird Road to further prevent motorists
from making a northbound or southbound left-turn movement.
Additionally, to enhance northbound motorists’ line of sight of eastbound approaching
vehicles, it is recommended that the Florida Department of Transportation work with the Post
Office to remove or trim the shrubs located on the south side of SR 976/Bird Road,
immediately west of SW 69th Avenue.

                                                                                             Parcel 7A

       that have been adopted by the local government, and provide a brief description of the previous
       changes (i.e., any information not already addressed in the Substantial Deviation Determination
       Chart). Has there been a change in local government jurisdiction for any portion of the
       development since the last approval or development order was issued? If so, has the annexing
       local government adopted a new DRI development order for the project?

       Palmer Ranch Increment IV was originally approved by Sarasota County Resolution No. 89-205
       on June 20, 1989 and has been amended two times (2) to date. The previous amendments
       involved the following:

           a) Sarasota County Ordinance No. 97-026 on March 11, 1997 added 21 ± acres (Parcels
              A8 and A9) located south of East Sawyer Loop Road and east of McIntosh Road and
              amended Development Order Conditions.

           b) Sarasota County Ordinance No. 2014-035, on July 9, 2014 added 180 residential units
              to Increment IV and amended Development Order Conditions, including the requiring
              Parcels A2 and A6 be developed under the provisions of the Planned Unit
              Development (PUD) Overlay District.

       There has been no change in local government jurisdiction for any portion of the development
       since the last approval or development order issued.

8.     Describe any lands purchased or optioned within 1/4 mile of the original DRI site subsequent to
       the original approval or issuance of the DRI development order. Identify such land, its size,
       intended use, and adjacent non-project land uses within ½ mile on a project master site plan or
       other map.

       No lands have been purchased or optioned within ¼ mile of the original DRI site.

9.     Indicate if the proposed change is less than 40% (cumulatively with other previous changes) of
       any of the criteria listed in Paragraph 380.06(19)(b), Florida Statutes.

       No additional residential or non-residential units are proposed to be added to the Palmer
       Ranch DRI. This NOPC proposes to allocate 260 residential units, approved as part of the
       Palmer Ranch Master Development Order, within Increment IV.

       Do you believe this notification of change proposes a change which meets the criteria of
       Subparagraph 380.06(19)(e)2., F.S.

               Yes X           No

10.    Does the proposed change result in a change to the buildout date or any phasing date of the
       project? If so, indicate the proposed new buildout or phasing dates.

        Originally approved on June 20, 1989 by the Sarasota Board of County Commissioners
       (Resolution No. 89-205), Palmer Ranch Increment IV predates the requirement that a build-
       out date be specified.

               In addition to the preliminary information provided to the DRC staff members at the
               November 6, 2014 pre-application meeting for this proposed NOPC, a detailed
               technical analysis has been specifically provided for land use, transportation,

       c.      A proposed amended development order deadline for commencing physical
               development of the proposed changes, if applicable;

               Originally approved on June 20, 1989 by the Sarasota Board of County Commissioners
               (Resolution No. 89-205), Palmer Ranch Increment IV predates the requirement that
               deadlines for commencing physical development be specified.

       d.      A proposed amended development order termination date that reasonably reflects the
               time required to complete the development;

               Originally approved on June 20, 1989 by the Sarasota Board of County Commissioners
               (Resolution No. 89-205), Palmer Ranch Increment IV predates the requirement for
               termination dates to be specified.

       e.      A proposed amended development order date until which the local government agrees
               that the changes to the DRI shall not be subject to down-zoning, unit density reduction,
               or intensity reduction, if applicable; and

               This proposed change will, in effect, restate and ratify the existing Development
               Order, with a new effective Development Order date.

       f.      Proposed amended development order specifications for the annual report, including
               the date of submission, contents, and parties to whom the report is submitted as

A.      Summary of Changes Proposed

Palmer Ranch DRI was originally approved by the Sarasota Board of County Commissioners on
December 18, 1984 (Resolution No. 84-418). The existing Palmer Ranch properties are generally located
east of U.S. 41, north of Preymore Street, south of Clark Road and west of I-75. The existing Palmer
Ranch development is approved for the following entitlements:

        •       11,550 residential dwelling units;
        •       99 acres ± of internal commercial, plus additional square footage of commercial/office
                approved/planned in designated Activity Centers; and
        •       1.75 million square feet of industrial development.

Increment IV consists of nine parcels, A1 through A9, containing approximately 251.63± acres. These
are approved for 1,756,000 square feet of office, light industrial, and warehousing uses and 180
residential uses. The Applicant proposes this Notice of Proposed Change to allow for the development
of 260 multi-family dwelling units on a 20± acre portion of Parcel A7, instead of the approved 275,000
square feet of light industrial and warehousing uses. No changes are proposed for the balance of the

B.      Environmental Analysis

The northerly 20±-acre portion of Palmer Ranch Parcel A7 is the subject of this NOPC. The project area is
comprised of a 15.0±-acre portion that is under contract for purchase by The Spanos Corporation.
Approximately 5 acres will remain under the ownership and control of the Palmer Park of Commerce
Master Association. Cardno ENTRIX ecologists conducted habitat assessments and a Grand Tree survey
in October 2014. Habitats and land uses were mapped in accordance with the Florida Land Use Cover
and Forms Classification System (FLUCFCS) (FDOT, January 1999) as depicted in the Land Use Map
included in the Environmental Information Appendix.

Approximately 90% of the Parcel A-7 project area is best classified as improved pasture. Although this
pasture is still actively grazed, it is mostly dominated by poor-forage-quality grasses and forbs. The
remaining uplands within Parcel A-7 project area are located outside of the pasture area and are located
within the upland buffer or other areas immediately adjacent to wetlands on the southern or eastern
perimeters of the parcel.

A constructed lake and canal occurs along the eastern side of Parcel A-7 project area. This surface water
management system was designed as part of the Catfish Creek stormwater requirement under the IDO
for the Palmer Park of Commerce. Depressional areas connected by a narrow slough also occur in the
eastern side of Parcel A-7.

The project area is greatly disturbed and contains minimal native habitats within the area being
proposed for development as Parcel A-7. A small band of native trees occurs along the southern
perimeter of the parcel and buffers the adjacent wetland from the proposed development. The limited
natural resources on the proposed development area will be protected in accordance with the Sarasota
County Comprehensive Plan’s Principles for Evaluating Development Proposals in Native Habitats and all
other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

Although several listed species could potentially occur, only three listed species, wood stork (Mycteria
americana), limpkin (Aramus gaurana) and little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), were observed feeding
or loafing along the edges of the stormwater lake and canal. It is expected that other state-listed
wading birds may use the stormwater wetlands on the parcel for foraging or loafing. No evidence of
nesting by any of these species has been observed on the subject parcel. The preservation and
management of natural wetlands and the construction of additional lakes on the subject project will
maintain foraging and loafing habitats for water birds.

In summary, development of the proposed Palmer Ranch Parcel A-7 project area is unlikely to impact
native habitats as the development area consists entirely of highly impacted uplands. Consistent with
Increment IV IDO Wetlands conditions, no impacts are proposed to wetlands or their buffers and
management of those areas will continue following site development. The proposed project is also

consistent with Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan’s Goals, Objectives and Policies for Environmental
Protection and with Land Development Regulations for upland and wetland habitat protection.

The subject project is consistent with the Increment IV IDO Vegetation and Wildlife conditions and the
previously executed Permanent Easement between Palmer Ranch and the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission resolves potential threats to listed species. Furthermore, our assessment of the
subject site indicates that development of the upland portion of the project as proposed is unlikely to
result in an impact to state or federally listed wildlife. For additional information refer to the
Environmental Information included in the appendix.

C.      Stormwater Analysis

Existing Conditions
The 20± acre portion of Parcel A7 which is the subject of this NOPC to Increment IV lies within
the Catfish Creek Watershed Basin. Under existing conditions, the stormwater runoff generated
from the Parcel A7 improvement project area is conveyed ultimately to the Catfish Creek Lat-2.
Stormwater runoff from the project area is conveyed to the surrounding existing treatment
lakes located on the east side of the developable project area via overland.

Proposed Conditions
The Conceptual Environmental and Surface Water Management Plan (CSWMP) proposes to
attenuate stormwater from the developable portion of the 20± acre project interconnecting the
proposed stormwater pond on the north end of the project to the existing lake to the east and
expanding the existing lake on the southeast corner of the project area. Treatment for the
proposed project area has been accounted in the existing large lake to the south according to
ERP No.: 491293.03/.15/.25 for the Palmer Park of Commerce Phase I. Normal water levels for
the proposed stormwater lakes are kept the same as on the previously permitted conditions.
Existing drainage patterns through the site and final point of discharge will be maintained in the
proposed condition.

Results and Conditions
A summary of the existing conditions, revised existing conditions and proposed conditions
water surface elevations in the Catfish Creek watershed are compared in Table 1 of the Surface
Water Management Plan in the Appendix, at strategic onsite and off-site locations (nodes),
which might be influenced by the Parcel A7 improvement project area.

In our professional opinion, the results of these analyses indicate that the development of
Parcel A7 will not have an adverse impact to the off-site surface water elevations. It is our
understanding that additional information shall be required by Sarasota County during the
Construction Plan review process. Refer to the Surface Water Management Plan in the
Appendix for the full report.

D.      Transportation Impact Analysis

The impacts from the property were accounted for in the Palmer Ranch 2014 Transportation
Reanalysis which was submitted to Sarasota County in late September. As part of the 2014
Transportation Reanalysis, 240 townhomes were assigned to Parcel A-7. The 2014
Transportation Reanalysis demonstrates that the roads included in the Master Development
Order provide a benefit larger than the impact of the approved Palmer Ranch land uses at
buildout. Because the proposed use is 20 units greater than what was assumed in the 2014
Transportation Reanalysis, verification that no off-site improvements are needed in conjunction
with this project was performed. The analysis determined that no off-site transportation
improvements are required as part of the project.

In addition, the two project access points were evaluated. At the Sawyer Loop Road driveway
connection the existing two-way left turn lane will be adequate to accommodate the required
southbound left turn deceleration and queue storage length. No right turn lanes are warranted
at either driveway connection. Queuing from the gates was also evaluated at the two project
access points and indicates that there is adequate queue storage on-site to accommodate the
projected queues.

For additional information refer to the Transportation Impact Analysis in the Appendix.

      square feet of industrial and office uses. Five (5) EDU’s have been assumed for the amenity center and
      office.

Non-Potable Water Demands and Non-Potable Water Supply Sources

The non-potable demands are based on irrigation of the common areas, and landscaping in road right-
of-ways. The irrigation requirements are based on a landscaped/grassed area demand of approximately
32 inches per year. SWFWMD’s AGMOD program was used to determine the approximate amount of
allowable irrigation required to maintain the turf/landscaping. Consequently, the non-potable water
demand for Increment IV Parcels A7 is estimated to be 0.009 MGD, on annual average.

The project irrigation requirement/non-potable water demands are anticipated to be met through the
use of reclaimed water as the primary source and/or surface water/irrigation well(s) as back-up source.
The treated wastewater effluent shall be provided by Sarasota County Utilities from the Central County
Facility. Alternate or supplemental surface water sources will be the proposed development’s
retention/detention lakes and irrigation wells as necessary. Neither the need nor the degree of

stormwater use or irrigation wells can be quantified at this time. If these sources are used, the
protection of wetland hydroperiods will be ensured through permitting and monitoring. The applicant
would be required to obtain any necessary permits for stormwater irrigation use from Sarasota County
and/or the Southwest Florida Water Management District. These agencies typically evaluate wetland
impacts associated with the consumptive water use. More importantly, reasonable assurances that
wetland hydroperiods will not be impacted will be provided through the implementation of the
approved program for monitoring and maintaining wetland hydroperiods under the Palmer Ranch
Master Development Order (Resolution No. 91-170).

Existing and Proposed Wells

No known water wells exist on Parcel A7.

and preservation of native plantings and other appropriate ornamental plantings and buffer
strips in street rights of way and in other public and private open spaces. Manage the urban
plantings efficiently, maximizing the use of limited resources.

ENV Policy 4.6.6.
To the maximum extent practical and consistent with applicable ordinances, invasive and
nuisance vegetation shall be removed from designated protected native habitats and
preservation and conservation areas on lands associated with a County approved development
order. Said removal of designated invasive and nuisance vegetation shall be maintained in
perpetuity. Where practical, invasive and nuisance vegetation will be removed from County-
owned property and replaced with native or other appropriate ornamental species.

ENV Policy 4.6.7.
During the development review process, encourage the private sector to preserve naturally
vegetated areas that are not designated as preserve or conservation areas, to relocate
elsewhere native vegetation that cannot be preserved, and to remove invasive and nuisance
plants.

ENV Objective 4.8
Coordinate future land uses and provision of urban services with the protection of
environmental resources.

ENV Policy 4.8.1.
Land uses and land and water development shall be consistent with and governed by the
environmental Values and Functions of Sarasota County's native habitats in accordance with
the "Principles for Evaluating Development Proposals in Native Habitats."

ENV Policy 4.8.2.
The County shall continue to require planted littoral zones to provide water quality treatment
for surface waters and wildlife habitat.

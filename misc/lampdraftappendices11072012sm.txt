DESIGN CHARRETTE


The Design Charrette took place on January 22, 2011 between 9:30 and 12:00 pm in the Lakeridge
High School cafeteria. Because this was the first public involvement event for the Luscher Area
Master Plan, MIG presented a slideshow to explain the purpose of the plan, to orient people to
the project site, to present site analysis findings, and to highlight some of the site’s opportunities
and challenges. The public was then divided into groups to engage in hour-long brainstorming
sessions about the site’s programmatic elements. Once the teams completed this task, a
representative from each group presented their findings to the overall group. As a supplement to
this exercise, participants were asked to fill out a comment card and draft a postcard to a friend
after spending a day at Lusher Farm in the year 2030. The comment card was available at the
event and online, and the 356 responses by Lake Oswego residents are summarized below.*

 Throughout the document, we use a graphic representation known as a word cloud to represent
the answers provided by respondents of the questionnaires. The word clouds are generated by
inputting concise, summarized words from each comment, which are then sized based on their
frequency of use in the data set. They represent the issues and preferences that emerged from the
public involvement process.




1. Of all the ideas generated at the charrette for the Luscher Area, what are your top three priorities?

OPEN HOUSE


The Open House took place on April 21, 2011 between 4:00 and 7:00 pm in Lake Oswego’s West End
Building. The room was set up with a welcome desk, three large-scale alternative plans on easels,
and a video screen that scrolled through images of the Luscher Area throughout the evening. As
participants came in, they were lead to a poster that explained how the evening would work:

“Lake Oswego Parks and Recreation is planning for the future of the Luscher Area and we need
your input! Currently, Lake Oswego Parks and Recreation and MIG are working to create a
Master Plan that will guide future stewardship, capital improvements, recreation programs,
and activities in the Luscher Area. Throughout this process, we have gathered input from you
and your fellow community members about your needs, hopes, and wishes. Today’s Open House
provides another opportunity for you to comment on the direction of the changes proposed for
the Luscher Area. These design alternatives are based on the community input we’ve received
throughout this process, including a design charrette held in January 2011, online surveys, and
intercept events that have been held throughout Lake Oswego over the past several months.
Please take time to review the alternatives and provide your comments.”

“STEP 1 : Sign-in at the Registration Table, create a name tag, and pick-up a Comment Card and
dots. STEP 2: Review the three design alternatives, which are displayed on easels. Watch the
slideshow of images of different areas and activities currently taking place in the Luscher Area.
Place a dot on the board that contains your preferred alternative, and place up to five dots next
to images that show a feature or activity you enjoy. STEP 3: Find a table and spend some time
providing comments about your preferred alternative and what you envision for the future of the
Luscher Area. STEP 4: Turn your Comment Card in to the Registration Table. STEP 5: Stay involved!
Tell neighbors and friends who were not able to attend that they can comment online between
now and Sunday, May 8, 2011. Mark your calendars for the next online comment period in mid-
June 2011, which will feature the preferred alternative.”

In total, approximately 369 comment cards were submitted by Lake Oswego residents at the event
and online. Their responses are summarized below.

    PRAB MEETING


    The Parks and Recreation Advisory Board Meeting took place on the evening of June 15, 2011 in
    Lake Oswego’s West End Building. MIG presented a slideshow of the Draft Preferred Alternative,
    which included an overview of the project’s history and the 1997 Master Plan, finding from
    the 2025 Parks Plan, site analysis issues, and feedback form previous Luscher Area Master Plan
    outreach efforts, as well as a walk-through of the Draft Preferred Alternative Design.

    Following the presentation, there was a discussion between the Luscher Area Master Plan team
    and the PRAB, and then members of the public were invited to step forward and make comments.
    Once again, a comment card was provided at the event and online. The 908 comments provided
    by Lake Oswego residents are summarized below.

2. Please provide any general comments about the Draft Preferred Alternative.




It is important to note, here, that 585 of the 908 tallied comments supported additional sportsfields
at the Luscher Area site. While this may represent a true number of sportsfields proponents, almost
half of these comments were written in exactly same way, namely: “I support additional fields for
kids in Lake Oswego.”

Because this influx of identical comments influenced the survey results - and, therefore, the
word cloud - so intensely, we are providing a supplemental word cloud that displays only those
comments that are not related to sportsfields. By removing references to additional sportsfields
from the data set, the other comments become large enough to read and comprehend, thereby
allowing us to also see other popular issues and desires for the site.

       Luscher Area Master Plan (LAMP) Executive Summary Vision Statement
                         created by the LAMP advisory board Working Group1.

The Luscher Area Master Plan is the culmination of nearly 20 years of hopes, aspirations, and
planning of this 186 acre site2. It reflects the evolution of Lake Oswego, our needs and
priorities. The preservation of this diverse site, so rich in history, but also full of opportunity for
the future, is of the highest priority for all who love Luscher Farm. The creation of this plan is a
generational chance to integrate the open space, sustainability, historic, educational, and
recreational sensibilities of our community. This Luscher Area Master Plan reflects a snapshot
of the present, and a legacy for future citizens to appreciate and enjoy what has been created
and preserved.

The group of properties, which together make up the Luscher Area park lands1, is unique in the
City. Rolling agricultural landscapes, tree groves, streams, wetlands, historic farm buildings, and
a working farm make up the primary character of these properties. The variety of land types
and uses together with the aggregate size of these parcels qualifies them to be thought of as a
district with its own set of land use definitions. Its location and open character on the southeast
border of the City allow it to serve as a buffer between the City and unincorporated Clackamas
County. This buffer zone function is reinforced by consolidating the active recreational sports
fields around the existing Hazelia Field. The assets of agricultural lands, natural areas and the
historic core of the Rudy Luscher Farm shall be respected and preserved for future generations
while meeting the growing demand for active recreational uses together with bicycle and
pedestrian connectivity

Following the principles laid out in the Parks Plan 2025, the Luscher Area Master Plan embodies
the principles of sustainability, historic preservation, natural resource protection, and
recreation. It seeks to meet the needs of today’s citizens without compromising those of future
citizens. An Education Center is envisioned which is expected to provide a vehicle to promote a
supportive community by teaching youth and adults about the importance of farming and food,
as well as wetland conservation, environmental stewardship and connecting with our historic
past. This multi-faceted approach to developing the Luscher Area park properties will help the
City thrive.

RE: Luscher Farms Master Plan Transportation Analysis

Dear Ms. Gilmer,

This transportation assessment report has been prepared to support the proposed Luscher Farms
Master Plan in Lake Oswego, Oregon. This report examines the characteristics of the Luscher Farms
Master Plan proposal and identifies the transportation infrastructure needs required to support the
overall master plan vision.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The existing Luscher Area is located in the northeast quadrant of the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
intersection in Lake Oswego as illustrated in Figure 1. The area currently consists of a multi-use sports
field, a children’s play area, walking and biking trails, a 114-stall parking lot, off-leash dog parks,
community gardens, wetlands, open space, environmental/agricultural education facilities, and other
support facilities.

Since the last master planning effort was completed in 1997, the City of Lake Oswego acquired four
properties totaling 81.43 additional acres of land to add to the 70.59 acres that were already owned by
the City. These new land acquisitions, paired with the fact that the City’s parks and recreation needs
have changed over the last 15 years, prompted the City to create a new master plan for the 152-acre
Luscher Area.

The master plan is intended to provide long-term direction for the development of all of the public
properties in the Luscher Area. The new Master Plan vision includes the following elements in addition
to the existing attributes: two neighborhood parks (Farr and Rassekh properties), 8-court tennis center
and parking lot, multi-use athletic field and parking lot, two basketball courts, oak upland and grassland
restoration, stream and riparian area restoration, expanded community gardens, environmental
education center, agriculture-theme children's play area, open-air shelter, ropes challenge course, and
three new trailheads. Figure 2 illustrates the specific Master Plan vision.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.



Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The Luscher Area currently consists of a multi-use sports field, a children’s play area, walking and biking
trails, a 114-stall parking lot, off-leash dog parks, community gardens, wetlands, open space, and
environmental/agricultural education facilities. The area is bounded by Stafford Road to the west,
Rosemont Road to the south, and rural residential areas to the north and east. Vehicular access to the
existing recreational amenities is provided via an access road located at the Stafford Road/Overlook
Drive intersection. In addition, there is a small gravel parking area off of Stafford Road that provides
alternative access to the Luscher Farms dog park and recreational trail.

Traffic Volumes and Peak Hour Operations
In May 2012, manual turning movement counts were obtained for all of the existing study
intersections. All of the counts used in this analysis were conducted on a typical mid-week day during
the evening (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak time period. Figure 4 summarizes the existing weekday p.m.
turning-movement counts. All volumes shown are rounded to the nearest five vehicles per hour.
Appendix “A” contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.


LEVEL OF SERVICE DESCRIPTION & OPERATING STANDARDS
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. A description of level of service and the criteria by which
they are determined is presented in Appendix “B”. Appendix “B” also indicates how level of service is
measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service.

To ensure that this analysis was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, the peak 15-minute flow
rate during the peak hour analysis periods was used in the evaluation of all intersection levels of
service. Traffic conditions during other typical weekday hours and throughout most weekends will
likely be better than those described in this report.

Level of service analyses in this report for signalized and roundabout intersections are based on the
intersection’s ability to accommodate the most difficult, or critical, approach. Level of service analyses
for signalized intersections in this report are based on the average control delay per vehicle entering
the intersection. The City of Lake Oswego bases intersection operations on level of service (LOS). City of
Lake Oswego standards require that intersections operate at level of service “E” or better (less than 80
seconds of average per vehicle control delay), which includes the Stafford Road/Overlook Drive
intersection. Clackamas County requires that the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout operate at
level of service “D” (less than 55 seconds of average per vehicle control delay).

YEAR 2032 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The year 2032 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system may
operate without the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan vision within a 20-year time period. This
analysis accounts for traffic attributed to general growth in the region, but does not include traffic from
the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan.


PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
No funded transportation capacity improvements exist within the site vicinity. The only currently
identified (non-funded) project is the installation of bike lanes along Stafford Road south of the
Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES
While no specific development activities were noted that will add significantly to existing traffic
volumes in the immediate site vicinity, a three percent annual growth rate was assumed along the
Stafford Road and Rosemont Road corridors to account for continued regional traffic growth through
the study area. This growth rate is a conservative representation that is consistent with the Metro
Regional Travel Demand Model and other historical planning efforts in the area. The resulting 2032
weekday p.m. peak hour background traffic volumes are summarized in Figure 5.

2032 BACKGROUND LEVEL-OF-SERVICE ANALYSIS
The 2032 weekday p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figures 5 were used to
prepare an operational analysis at each study intersection. Similar to existing conditions, the Stafford
Road/Overlook Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably during the p.m. peak
hour. However, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout is forecast to operate over capacity
during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Appendix “D” contains the year 2032 background traffic
operations worksheets.

2032 Stafford Road/Rosemont Road Roundabout Intersection Operations
Table 3 summarizes the 2032 background operational results at the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
intersection. As shown in the Table, the northbound and southbound approaches are forecast to
operate over capacity. In addition, due to delay on both approaches, the overall intersection level of
service is “F”. Based on these findings, continued regional traffic growth along the Stafford and
Rosemont Road corridors will require an enhancement to the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
roundabout.

In an effort to identify an appropriate mitigation, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection has
been analyzed under a double lane roundabout design. This design would provide dual entry and exit
lanes on the north and south approaches along Stafford Road. The westbound Rosemont Road
approach would also have dual entry lanes with the right lane designated for right turns and the left
lane designated for left turns. This design is consistent with driver expectations and would provide
continuity if Stafford Road is ever expanded to five lanes. The basic design parameters for this design
are outlined below:

                Inscribed circle diameter of 175 feet
                30-foot circulatory width
                Double-lane entries and exits on the north and south legs (Stafford Road)
                A continuous right-turn lane on the south leg to facilitate northbound to eastbound
                 movements.

PROPOSED MASTER PLAN
The master plan is intended to provide long-term direction for the development of all of the public
properties in the Luscher Area. The new Master Plan vision includes the following elements in addition
to the existing park attributes: two neighborhood parks (Farr and Rassekh properties), an 8-court
tennis center and parking lot2, multi-use athletic field and parking lot, two basketball courts, oak
upland and grassland restoration, stream and riparian area restoration, expanded community gardens,
environmental education center, agriculture-theme children's play area, open-air shelter, ropes
challenge course, and three new trailheads. Figure 2 illustrates the specific Master Plan vision.

The projected timeframe for complete build-out of the master plan vision is unknown. However, for
the purposes of this analysis, it has been assumed that buildout would occur over a twenty-year
period.


Assumed Access Improvements
The primary access to the Luscher Area is assumed to continue to occur via the Stafford Road/Overlook
Drive intersection. As part of the master plan vision, a secondary access is proposed off of Rosemont
Road. Additional discussion on this secondary access is provided later in this report.




2
    The 8-court tennis center is technically not a part of the Luscher Farms Master Plan as it will potentially be located on
a separate parcel on the west side of Stafford Road. However, the traffic impacts of this tennis center have been
included in this study at the request of City of Lake Oswego Parks and Recreation staff.

Trip Generation
The existing Luscher Area is a unique community resource that is composed of varied amenities.
Accordingly, there are no empirical data sources that would provide a means of estimating the trip
generation potential of the expanded Luscher Farms Master Plan vision. As such, it was assumed for
the purposes of this analysis that the master plan vision would simply generate a 200% increase in the
amount of existing trips currently being generated by the site. This increase in trip generation is
reasonable given the sizeable increase in amenities and activity areas that would be offered at full
buildout of the master plan vision. Table 5 summarizes the resulting trip generation estimates.

YEAR 2032 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area’s transportation system will operate
with the traffic generated by the proposed master plan vision. The year 2032 background traffic
volumes for the weekday p.m. peak hour (shown in Figure 5) were added to the site-generated traffic
(shown in Figure 5) to arrive at the total traffic volumes illustrated in Figure 6.



2032 Total Traffic Intersection Level of Service
The weekday p.m. peak hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figure 6 were used to conduct an
operational analysis at each study intersection to determine the year 2032 total traffic levels of service.
The results of the total traffic analysis shown in Figure 6 indicate that the Stafford Road/Overlook
Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably. However, like 2032 Background
conditions, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection is forecast to continue to operate over
capacity as a single-lane roundabout. Appendix “E” contains the year 2032 total traffic level-of-service
worksheets.


Stafford Road/Rosemont Road Intersection
Table 6 summarizes the 2032 total traffic operational results at the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
intersection. As shown in the Table, the addition of site-generated traffic from the master plan vision
intensifies the traffic demand at the already over capacity single-lane roundabout.

With the double-lane roundabout mitigation previously identified in the Background conditions, the
Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection would operate acceptably as summarized in Table 7.
Furthermore, with the additional traffic being generated by the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision, no
additional mitigation measures are needed beyond those identified under background traffic
conditions.

ROSEMONT ROAD SITE ACCESS
As previously mentioned, the Master Plan envisions a secondary site access driveway off of Rosemont
Road. The access driveway would be located in the approximate location of the existing Luscher Farms
farm house driveway. This location was chosen as it is the only location along the Rosemont Road site
frontage that would provide adequate sight distance3.

In addition to the sight distance evaluation, the need for an eastbound left-turn lane was evaluated at
the proposed site driveway. The procedures used to determine the need for a left-turn lane were based
on a queuing model titled Volume Warrants for Left-Turn Storage Lanes and Unsignalized Grade
Intersections. The procedures take into account left-turn arrival rates, the volume of advancing and
opposed traffic, and the time interval required to make a left-turn maneuver. Based on the results of
the analysis, it was determined that an eastbound left-turn lane is warranted at the proposed
Rosemont Road site access.

    As part of this analysis, Kittelson & Associates, Inc. performed a preliminary intersection sight distance study at the
proposed Rosemont Road site access driveway location. Based on this analysis, the proposed site driveway would have
in excess of 600 feet of intersection sight distance looking west along Rosemont Road and approximately 600 feet of
intersection sight distance looking east along Rosemont Road. These distances are sufficient per the Clackamas County
Roadway Standards for the 40 mph posted speed and the design speed of 45 mph.

CONCLUSIONS
The results of the traffic analysis indicate that the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan vision can be
developed while maintaining acceptable levels of service on the surrounding transportation system.
The findings of this analysis and our recommendations are discussed below.


YEAR 2012 EXISTING CONDITIONS
                All of the study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday p.m. peak
                 hour.


YEAR 2032 BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
                The Stafford Road/Overlook Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably
                 during the p.m. peak hour.
                The Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout is forecast to operate over capacity during
                 the weekday p.m. peak hour.
                              Due to assumed continued growth along the Stafford Road and Rosemont Road
                               corridors, the northbound and southbound approaches are forecast to operate over
                               capacity.

                              With an expansion to a double-lane roundabout, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
                               intersection would operate acceptably during 2032 background traffic conditions.

                All of the study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday p.m. peak
                 hour.


PROPOSED LUSCHER AREA MASTER PLAN
                The Master Plan vision includes the following elements in addition to the existing park
                 attributes: two neighborhood parks (Farr and Rassekh properties), an 8-court tennis center
                 and parking lot , multi-use athletic field and parking lot, two basketball courts, oak upland
                 and grassland restoration, stream and riparian area restoration, expanded community
                 gardens, environmental education center, agriculture-theme children's play area, open-air
                 shelter, ropes challenge course, and three new trailheads.
                It was estimated that full build-out of the master plan vision would generate a 200%
                 increase in the amount of existing trips currently being generated by the site. This increase
                 in trip generation is reasonable given the sizeable increase in amenities and activity areas
                 that would be offered at full buildout of the master plan vision.

YEAR 2032 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
                The Stafford Road/Overlook Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate
                 acceptably.
                Like 2032 Background conditions, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection is forecast
                 to continue to operate over capacity as a single-lane roundabout.
                With the double-lane roundabout mitigation identified under Background conditions, the
                 Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection would operate acceptably under 2032 total
                 traffic conditions.
                       o With the additional traffic being generated by the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision,
                         no additional mitigation measures are needed beyond those identified under
                         background traffic conditions at the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection.
                There is adequate intersection sight distance at the proposed Rosemont Road site access.
                Based on the results of the left-turn lane analysis, it was determined that an eastbound left-
                 turn lane is warranted at the proposed Rosemont Road site access.



We trust this analysis provides adequate documentation to support the Luscher Farms Master Plan. If

Road, the road leading to the trailhead on the
Brock property, and the entrance to Hazelia
Field off Stafford Road. The new access points
include one to the east of the Luscher Farm
driveway, and one on the Rassekh property off
Atherton Road. The Master Plan does not
propose any new land division and each parcel
currently abuts a street with a minimum
width of 25 feet as currently required by City
access standards. Other criteria for
determining design conformance relate to
topography, nearby streets and anticipated
traffic volume. Conformance with specific
access standards, such as driveway
requirements and construction standards, will
be required during development review with
submittal of a traffic study. A preliminary
traffic study (Appendix D) evaluated the
locations of the proposed ingress/egress points.

VISION CLEARANCE
Intersections and access points are required to
comply with City vision clearance standards.
The development code currently requires
abutting intersections to remain clear of
obstructions that limit visibility of on-coming
traffic. All new access points will be designed
to conform with the City’s vision clearance
standards and will be determined during
development review. A preliminary traffic
study (Appendix D) evaluated the locations of
the proposed ingress/egress points.

Executive Summary




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Veterans Administration (VA) has begun construction of three new medical buildings, with a total
of approximately 108,500 square feet, that will replace the existing buildings, that total approximately
100,000 square feet, within the existing Walla Walla VA Medical Center in Walla, Walla, Washington. In
addition, a new 80-bed state nursing home and 40 leased apartment units for low-income veterans are
proposed within the campus boundary. Initially, the new medical buildings will replace the existing
medical buildings and the existing medical buildings will be vacant. However, the existing buildings will
remain on site and, in the long-term, reuse of the existing buildings for other government or private
offices is planned.

The Walla Walla VA Medical Center is bounded by Poplar Street to the north, Myra Road to the west, S.
13th Avenue to the east, and Fort Walla Walla Park to the south. Primary access to the medical center
will remain to be via Chestnut Street and Avery Street. The anticipated build-out year for the new
buildings is 2015. Future reuse of the existing buildings will not occur until beyond 2015 and, therefore,
for this analysis, was assumed to occur by the 2035 horizon year.

The results of this study indicate that the proposed VA campus expansion can be completed while
maintaining acceptable traffic operations and safety at the study intersections, assuming provision of
the recommended mitigation measures.


FINDINGS

Year 2013 Existing Conditions
                All of the study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service during the
                weekday p.m. peak hours.
                A review of historical crash data did not reveal any specific patterns or trends in the site
                vicinity that require mitigation associated with this project.
                The intersection sight distance for northbound left-turns at the Poplar Street/Avery Street
                intersection is limited to the west because of a fence and the curvature of Poplar Street.
                The intersection sight distance is limited to the minimum required 390 ft.


Year 2015 Background Traffic Conditions
                No other significant roadway or development projects are planned in the vicinity of the VA
                medical center.
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2015 background conditions.

Executive Summary


Proposed Development Plan
                The proposed expansion (expected to be completed by 2015) is estimated to generate
                approximately 460 daily net new trips of which 45 net new trips (20 inbound, 25 outbound)
                are projected to occur during the weekday p.m. peak hour. With future re-use of the
                existing medical and office buildings, the site in total is estimated to generate
                approximately 3,250 net new daily trips of which approximately 330 would occur during
                the weekday p.m. peak hour (110 inbound and 220 outbound).


Year 2015 Total Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2015 total traffic conditions with the developed of the proposed project.
                Additional turn lanes are not warranted at the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection
                during the weekday p.m. peak hour under 2015 total traffic conditions.


Year 2035 Background Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2035 background traffic conditions.


Year 2035 Total Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2035 total traffic conditions with the exception of the Poplar Street/Avery
                Street intersection.
                The northbound left-turn onto Poplar Street from Avery Street is projected to operate at
                LOS F with the additional traffic generated from the proposed re-use of the existing
                buildings.
                A westbound left-turn lane from Poplar Street onto Avery Street is warranted during the
                2035 weekday p.m. peak hour. It is likely that the volumes and operations at this
                intersection will also meet turn lane warrants during the weekday a.m. peak hour when
                staff arrive although that scenario was not specifically evaluated as part of this study.
                A planning-level signal warrant analysis indicated that the Poplar Street/Avery Street
                intersection is projected to meet traffic signal warrants although the volumes only exceed
                the warrant thresholds by a small amount.

Executive Summary


Site Circulation/Site-Access Operations
          Vehicular Circulation
                With the expansion, signage will need to be updated to direct visitors to the public parking
                areas.
                The following improvements were identified under the 2035 Total Traffic conditions at the
                Avery Street/Poplar Street entrance:
                    o Intersection sight distance could be improved by relocating the existing VA Medical
                      Center fence along Poplar Street to the west of Avery Street approximately 10 feet
                      further to the south in the vicinity Avery Street and the Poplar Street curve.
                    o Widening of the northbound approach to provide a separate northbound left-turn
                      lane and through-right lane is warranted based on the 2035 total traffic conditions
                      and will reduce the delay to right-turning vehicles at the intersection.
                    o A westbound left-turn lane is not warranted under 2015 conditions but does meet
                      warrants under 2035 conditions based on the assumptions of this analysis. It is not
                      recommend that this lane be constructed at this time but the need for this left-turn
                      lane should be re-examined in the long-term once future traffic volumes are
                      confirmed and the specific reuses for the existing VA buildings are known.
                The access location for the proposed state nursing home at the intersection of Wainwright
                Drive and the roadway accessing the baseball bleacher parking lot is expected to operate
                acceptably with stop-control on the northbound and southbound approaches.


          Pedestrian Circulation
                While the sidewalk system provides key connections between uses, there are many
                sections of sidewalk missing internally on site which restricts the ability to access some
                parts of the campus from Avery Street and Chestnut Street. Some of these missing sections
                of sidewalk include:
                    o Up the hill from the Avery Street access to the proposed new buildings.
                    o Between the parking located near the baseball bleachers and the Avery access road.
                With the planned state nursing home, a sidewalk along the south side of Wainwright Drive
                should also be considered depending on the final design of the facility.


RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings of this analysis, the following are recommended with the Walla Walla VA Medical
Center expansion:

Executive Summary


          Vehicular Traffic Recommendations
                The following improvements are recommended at the               Avery Street/Poplar Street
                entrance:
                    Near-Term
                    o Consider relocation of the VA Medical Center fence along Poplar Street to the west
                      of Avery Street approximately 10 feet south between the Avery Street and the curve
                      in Poplar Street to improve intersection sight distance for northbound vehicles. Trim
                      the trees and shrubbery as necessary. This is not required to meet minimum
                      requirements.
                    Long-Term (Upon Reuse and Occupation of the Existing Buildings)
                    o Widen the northbound approach at the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection to
                      provide a separate northbound left-turn lane and through-right lane. Provide
                      approximately 170 feet of left-turn storage.
                    o Re-examine the need for a westbound left-turn lane at the Poplar Street/Avery
                      Street intersection in the long-term once future traffic volumes evolve and the
                      specific reuse for the existing buildings is known, or if a safety issue is identified.
                    o Re-evaluate the need for a traffic signal at the Poplar Street/Avery Street
                      intersection once the existing building are reused and fully occupied.
                Update signing to direct vehicles to appropriate parking and buildings on site, particularly
                from the Avery Street access.


          Pedestrian Access Recommendations
               Review sidewalk connectivity between the buildings and the campus accesses to ensure
               pedestrians have a connected and continuous route from the off-site sidewalk system.

Additional details of the study methodology, findings, and recommendations are provided within this
report.

INTRODUCTION

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Veterans Administration (VA) has begun construction of three new medical buildings with a total of
approximately 108,500 square feet that will replace the existing buildings, that total approximately
100,000 square feet, within the existing Walla Walla VA Medical Center in Walla, Walla, Washington. In
addition, a new 80-bed state nursing home and 40 leased apartment units for low-income veterans are
proposed within the campus boundary. Initially, the new medical buildings will replace the existing
medical buildings and the existing medical buildings will be vacant. In the long-term, reuse of the
existing buildings for other government or private offices is anticipated. The anticipated build-out year
for the new buildings is 2015. Future reuse of the existing buildings is beyond 2015 and, therefore, was
assumed to be in place by the 2035 horizon year.

Primary access to the VA campus will remain to be via Chestnut Street and the Popular Street/Avery
Street intersection. Figure 1 shows the site vicinity map and Figure 2 illustrates the proposed site
expansion plan.


SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This analysis identifies the transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed Walla Walla VA
Medical Center expansion and was prepared in accordance with the Walla Walla Urban Area
Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines, Walla Walla, WA (Reference 1). The study intersections and
scope of this project were selected after discussion with the City of Walla Walla. Operational analyses
are performed at the following intersections:

                Poplar Street/Myra Road
                Poplar Street/Avery Street
                Poplar Street/9th Avenue
                Chestnut Street/9th Avenue


This report evaluates:

                Existing land-use and transportation-system conditions within the site vicinity during the
                weekday p.m. peak hour;
                Planned in-process developments and transportation improvements within the study area;
                Safety analysis and crash history within the site vicinity;

Existing Conditions




EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.

Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried the Walla Walla VA Medical Center
campus and surrounding study area in September 2012. At that time, KAI collected information
regarding site conditions, adjacent land uses, existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in
the study area.


SITE CONDITIONS AND ADJACENT LAND USES
The existing Walla Walla VA Medical Center occupies the historic site of Fort Walla Walla which pre-
dates the City of Walla Walla. In the 1920's the Fort was converted to a medical facility. The land uses in
the vicinity of the site are a mixture of commercial and industrial businesses, residential homes, and a
public park.


TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Table 1 summarizes the major roadways within the study area.

Roadway Facilities
The Walla Walla VA Medical Center site is south of Poplar Street, which is classified as a Minor Arterial
by the City of Walla Walla. The northern access to the medical center is located on Poplar Street at the
Avery Street intersection. The eastern access to the medical center is provided via Chestnut Street
which extends into the medical center campus as Wainwright Drive. Chestnut Street is a Local Street
west of 9th Avenue and a Minor Arterial east of 9th Avenue. Internally on the campus, all the roadways
are generally two lanes with posted speeds between 10 and 20 mph. Figure 3 shows the existing lane
configurations and traffic control devices at the study intersections.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
As shown in Table 1, all of the public roadways within the vicinity of the medical center have complete
sidewalk facilities on both sides of the road while none of the roadways have bicycle lanes. Within the
medical center campus, most roadways have sidewalks on one side and connect to specific buildings or
activity areas. Field observations taken in the site vicinity revealed that the existing sidewalk system
connects well to buildings, but is not well connected for pedestrians that enter the medical center from
the external street system and want to continue along the internal roadway system.


Transit Facilities
Transit to and from Walla Walla VA Campus is provided primarily via Valley Transit Route 6 (VA/Medical
Loop) which begins and ends at the Transfer Center and forms a loop on Poplar Street, Myra Road,
Dalles Military Road, and 9th Street. Route 5 (Fairgrounds) also provides service along 9th Street and
connects to the Transfer Center. Headways during the weekday peak hours are approximately 30
minutes. During the weekend, Valley Transit operates two loops that cover Walla Walla and College
Place with 45 minute headways.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
Based on discussions with City of Walla Walla and VA Medical Center staff, the weekday p.m. peak hour
was determined to be the study time period for the traffic analysis. The weekday p.m. peak hour was
chosen because it is the time period in which staff shifts change and visitations overlap.

In late September 2012, manual turning-movement counts were obtained for all of the study
intersections. All counts were collected for the weekday p.m. peak period (4:00 ­ 6:00 p.m.) during a
typical weekday (Tuesday through Thursday). Peak hours were determined on a per intersection basis
(as opposed to calculating an overall system peak) in order to capture the peaks in traffic at each study
intersection.

Due to the current on-site construction, a traffic count was also taken at the main construction access
in order to separate out the construction traffic from the normal weekday p.m. peak hour traffic. Based
on conversations with VA Medical Center Staff, the northwest loop road that intersects the Avery Street
access road is designated for construction traffic and the construction traffic primarily uses the Poplar
Street/Avery Street intersection. Therefore, a weekday p.m. peak hour traffic count was conducted for
the construction road which identified approximately two inbound construction-related vehicles and 18
outbound construction-related vehicles during the weekday p.m. peak hour. The construction traffic
volumes were subtracted from the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection turning movement volumes
in proportion to the existing turning movements.

Figure 4 provides a summary of the existing turning-movement counts, which are rounded to the
nearest five vehicles per hour. Appendix "A" contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.

Current Levels of Service
All level of service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 3). A description for level of service and the
criteria by which it is determined is presented in Appendix "B". Appendix "B" also indicates how level of
service is measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range for level of service.
Intersection level of service (LOS) ranges from "A" to "F", with "A" representing an intersection that
experiences very little delay and "F" representing an intersection that experiences what is typically
considered unacceptably long delays.

The City of Walla Walla has established minimum LOS standards in accordance with the Walla Walla
Urban Area Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines. The guidelines state that all roadways and
intersections (regardless of classification) must operate at a minimum LOS of "D." For Myra Road and
Poplar Street (Myra Road to 9th Street) LOS C is considered acceptable. LOS "E" is acceptable for critical
movements at local roadways. In addition, no existing intersection or critical movement should worsen
by more than two levels of service due to the impacts of a proposed development.

All intersection level of service evaluations presented in this report used the peak 15-minute flow rate
during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Using the peak 15-minute flow rate ensures that the analysis is
based on a reasonable worst-case scenario. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are
only likely to occur for 15 minutes out of each average peak hour. The transportation system will likely
operate under conditions better than those described in this report during all other time periods.

Figure 4 summarizes the level of service analysis for the study intersections under the weekday p.m.
peak hour existing traffic conditions. As shown in the figure, all of the study intersections currently
operate at acceptable levels of service during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Appendix "C" includes the
level of service worksheets for the existing traffic conditions analysis.

  Traffic Safety
  The crash history at the key intersections and City street segments in the study area was reviewed to
  identify potential safety issues. Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT) staff provided the
  most recent five year period of information, from January 2007 to January 2012, for the study
  intersections. Table 2 summarizes the crash data along the study roadways and at the study
  intersections. Note that intersections and roadways that had no recorded crashes are not shown.

  Table 2 shows that a total of approximately 178 crashes were reported within the study area. The
  intersections with the highest volumes of crashes were at Poplar Street/9th Avenue, Poplar Street/Myra
  Road, and Chestnut Street/9th Avenue. Most of the crashes were property damage only and most of the
  intersection crashes were rear-ends, which is common at signalized intersections. No other crash trends
  or safety deficiencies were identified at the study intersections. Appendix "D" includes the crash data

Transportation Impact Analysis




TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The transportation impact analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will operate in
the year the proposed development is expected to be fully built, 2015, and in the future planning
horizon year of 2035 at which time it is anticipated the existing buildings would be re-used and re-
occupied. The impact of traffic generated by the proposed expansion during the typical weekday p.m.
peak hour was examined as follows:

                Background conditions were developed by applying a 1.5% (current growth rate
                assumption used in Walla Walla, per discussion with the City Engineer) annual
                compounded growth rate to the existing traffic volumes to account for regional growth in
                the site vicinity and by adding in-process ("pipeline") traffic yet to be realized on the
                transportation system from other developments in Walla Walla and College Place.
                Weekday p.m. peak hour background traffic conditions for the years 2015 (build-out year
                of Walla Walla VA Campus) and 2035 (20-year planning-level analysis) were analyzed at
                each of the study intersections.
                Site-generated trips were estimated for expansion of the VA Medical Center to include the
                three new buildings, apartments, and a state nursing home in the near term; and reuse of
                the existing medical buildings in the long term.
                Site trip-distribution patterns were estimated based on existing traffic patterns in the area,
                the location of residential areas in the surrounding area, connections to the state highway
                system, and through discussions with City of Walla Walla Staff.
                Weekday p.m. peak hour total traffic conditions for the years 2015 (build-out year of Walla
                Walla VA Campus) and 2035 (20-year planning-level analysis and assumed reuse of the
                existing on-site buildings) were analyzed at each of the study intersections.
                Site circulation and site-access operations were evaluated.


YEAR 2015 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The year 2015 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will
operate in the year the expansion of Walla Walla VA Campus is expected to be completed and opened.
This analysis includes traffic attributed to planned developments within the study area and to general
growth in the region, but does not include the traffic from the proposed development.

Planned Developments and Transportation Improvements
KAI identified and reviewed the developments and transportation improvements planned within the
site vicinity. Based on information provided by the City or Walla Walla, there are no significant planned
developments or transportation improvements within the study area that should be included in the
2015 background analysis. It is expected that some developments in College Place will continue to build

out and that some of the commercial property in the area will get sold or redeveloped, but this type of
growth is accommodated in the typical yearly traffic growth rate that was applied.


Traffic Volumes
Year 2015 background traffic volumes were developed by applying a 1.5% compounded annual growth
rate to account for general regional growth and the general in-process ("pipeline") traffic from
developments in Walla Walla and College Place. Figure 5 illustrates the resulting forecast year 2015
background traffic volumes during the weekday p.m. peak hour.


Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Figure 5 summarizes the level of service analysis for the study intersections during the weekday p.m.
peak hour under year 2015 background traffic conditions. As can be seen from the figure, all of the
study intersections are forecast to operate at acceptable levels of service under this scenario. Appendix
"E" contains the year 2015 background traffic level of service worksheets.

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT PLAN
The Veterans Administration (VA) has begun construction of three new medical buildings with a total of
approximately 108,500 square feet that will replace the existing buildings, that total approximately
100,000 square feet, within the existing Walla Walla VA Medical Center in Walla, Walla, Washington. In
addition a new 80-bed state nursing home and 40 leased apartment units for low-income veterans are
proposed within the campus boundary. Initially, the new medical buildings will replace the existing
medical buildings and the existing medical buildings will be vacant. In the long-term, reuse of the
existing buildings for other government or private offices is planned. The anticipated completion for the
new buildings is 2015. Future reuse of the existing buildings is not expected until beyond 2015 and,
therefore, is only assumed to be completed by the 2035 horizon year. Primary access points to the VA
campus will remain to be via Chestnut Street and the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection.


Trip Generation
The trip generation for the proposed Walla Walla VA Campus expansion is made up of three
components. The first component is the construction of the new buildings which will provide for the
same services as the existing buildings. The new buildings will provide modern facilities for the existing
staff and patients. Therefore, the new buildings are not intended result in expanded staff, patient
services, or additional vehicle trips to the campus. The second component is the new uses on the
campus that will be added by 2015 including the nursing home and apartments. The final component is
the reuse of the existing buildings for another use beyond 2015.

The projected "net new"1 weekday daily and p.m. peak hour trips generated by the proposed Walla
Walla VA Campus expansion were estimated based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition
(Reference 4). Table 3 summarizes the anticipated number of trips that will be generated by the
proposed apartments and nursing home. The 2015 trip generation assumes the existing medical
facilities will move from the existing building to the new building without re-use of the existing
buildings. (All trip ends shown have been rounded to the nearest five trips).

Table 3 shows that the addition of the proposed nursing home and apartments will add an estimated
460 new daily trips to the transportation system each weekday once they are fully occupied. It is
estimated that 45 of those trips (20 inbound, 25 outbound) will occur during the weekday p.m. peak
hour.
Table 4 summarizes the anticipated net new trips expected to be generated in the long-term by 2035
when the existing medical center buildings (approximately 100,000 square feet) have been improved
and reoccupied as offices or a similar type of use.

As shown in Table 4, the addition of the proposed state nursing home, apartments, and reuse of the
existing office space will add an estimated 3,250 new daily trips to the transportation system each
weekday once they are fully occupied. It is estimated that 330 of those trips (110 inbound, 220
outbound) will occur during the weekday p.m. peak hour.


Site Trip Distribution/Trip Assignment
The site-generated trips were distributed onto the study area roadways based on existing traffic
patterns in the area, the location of residential areas surrounding the Walla Walla VA Campus, from
previous work completed by KAI in the study area, and through discussions with City of Walla Walla and
VA Medical Center Staff who provided insight on the travel patterns of Walla Walla VA Campus-related
trips. Figure 6 illustrates the estimated trip distribution pattern for the proposed expansion.

The estimated weekday p.m. peak hour site-generated trips were assigned to the network by
distributing the trips shown in Table 3 and Table 4 according to the trip distribution pattern shown in
Figure 6. Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the site-generated trips that are expected to use the roadway
system during the weekday p.m. peak hour in 2015 and 2035, respectively.

Transportation Impact Analysis



YEAR 2015 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area's transportation system will operate
with the traffic generated by the proposed Walla Walla VA Campus included in addition to the
background transportation system.


Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The weekday p.m. peak hour total traffic turning-movement volumes were developed by adding the
site-generated traffic from Figure 7 to the background traffic in Figure 5 (before rounding) and rounding
to the nearest five vehicles. Figure 9 shows year 2015 weekday p.m. peak hour total traffic volumes and
operational levels of service. As seen from Figure 9, all the study intersections are projected to operate
at acceptable levels of service with the proposed expansion in 2015. Appendix "F" contains the year
2015 total traffic level of service worksheets.

At the request of the City, as part of the intersection level of service analysis, the Poplar Street/Myra
Road intersection operations were reviewed to determine if re-striping the outside northbound
through-right lane to a right-turn-only lane would be beneficial to the intersection operations. A review
of this option found that the existing through-right configuration of the northbound outside lane results
in better intersection operations than conversion to a right-turn lane. Based on this analysis, the
intersection configuration should remain as it is unless a specific safety issue is identified that could be
improved by changing the lane configuration of the northbound approach.


YEAR 2035 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The purpose of the year 2035 background traffic analysis is to provide the City with a planning-level
analysis of the study area traffic operations in the long-term horizon. This analysis includes traffic
growth generated by future development planned within the study area as well as the VA being able to
reuse the existing buildings that are currently being replaced with new facilities. Once the new buildings
are completed, staff from the existing buildings will be moved to the new buildings and the existing
buildings will be temporarily decommissioned and left vacant until an appropriate user is identified and
the buildings can be modified and reused. No additional planned transportation improvements or
developments were identified outside of those already outlined under the year 2015 background traffic
analysis; therefore, reference the Year 2015 Background Traffic Conditions section of this report for
assumptions also applied to the year 2035 background traffic conditions.


Traffic Volumes
Year 2035 background traffic volumes were developed by applying a 1.5% compound annual growth
rate to account for general regional growth. Figure 10 shows the year 2035 background traffic volumes
projected during the weekday p.m. peak hour.

Transportation Impact Analysis


Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Figure 10 summarizes the level of service analysis for the study intersections during the weekday p.m.
peak hours under year 2035 background traffic conditions. As shown in Figure 10, all the study
intersection are expected to operate acceptably under 2035 background traffic conditions. However, it
should be noted that the critical movement at the unsignalized Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection
is forecast to operate at LOS "E" under this scenario. Appendix "G" contains the year 2035 background
traffic level of service worksheets.

One issue that the City of Walla Walla asked to have examined was the potential for restriping the
outside northbound through lane at the Poplar Street/Myra Road intersection to be a right-turn lane.
This option was analyzed under 2035 background conditions and resulted in a worsening of the
intersection operations. While the northbound right-turning volume is high enough where a right-turn
lane is typically considered, there are still more northbound through vehicles so that the overall
intersection operates better with the existing configuration.


YEAR 2035 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The year 2035 total traffic conditions provides the City with a long-term planning-level assessment of
how the study area's transportation system will operate with the traffic generated by the proposed
Walla Walla VA Campus expansion. The 2035 site-generated traffic volumes shown in Figure 7 are
added to the year 2035 background traffic volumes (shown in Figure 10) to arrive at the year 2035
weekday p.m. peak hour total traffic volumes shown in Figure 11.


Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The weekday p.m. peak hour total traffic turning-movement volumes are shown Figure 11. These were
used to conduct an operational analysis at each study intersection to determine the year 2035 total
traffic levels of service. As shown in Figure 11, all the study intersections are expected to continue to
operate acceptably, with the exception of the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection which is forecast
to operate at LOS F and over capacity for the northbound approach. Appendix "H" includes the year
2035 total traffic level of service worksheets.


Poplar Street/Avery Street Intersection Operations
The northbound left-turn at the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection is expected to operate at LOS F
under year 2035 total traffic conditions. The reason for the northbound left-turn operating at LOS F is
the increase in northbound left-turns at the intersection based on the additional traffic generated from
the reuse of the existing buildings. As shown in Figure 8, approximately 77 northbound left-turns are
projected to be added to the northbound left-turn which increases the total movement volume to
approximately 135 vehicles during the weekday p.m. peak hour. That volume exceeds the capacity of
the movement.

 Transportation Impact Analysis


 In order to accommodate the expected northbound left-turn demand, three mitigation options were
 reviewed: 1) installation of a separate northbound left-turn lane; 2) installation of a two-way left-turn
 lane which would provide a center refuge for northbound left-turns to make a two-stage movement;
 and 3) installation of a traffic signal. The results of these options are shown in Table 5.

                                                                                  Critical Movement Weekday PM

 As shown in Table 5, widening the northbound approach to provide a separate left-turn lane allows the
 critical northbound approach to operate under capacity but still at LOS F. Adding a center turn lane that
 could be used by northbound left-turns as a refuge for two-stage gap acceptance significantly improves
 the operation of the northbound left-term to LOS D. The potential issue with this option is that using
 the center turn lane as a refuge for northbound left-turns conflicts with eastbound left-turns onto
 Avery Street. Given only 15 vehicles are projected in 2035 for the eastbound left-turn during the
 weekday p.m. peak hour, this issue is not expected to be a significant problem but could become an
 issue if traffic growth on Avery Street exceeds these projections.

 With the installation of a traffic signal, the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable LOS A. A
 planning-level signal warrant analysis was also performed in order to assess whether a traffic signal is
 warranted. The two most common volume warrants were reviewed. The signal warrant results are
 shown in Table 6.

Transportation Impact Analysis


As shown in Table 6, Warrant 1A (Minimum Vehicular Volume) is met however the other volumes
warrants are not. As such, it is recommended to monitor the need for a traffic signal once the
expansion and future reuse of the existing facilities is completed as more detailed and specific evolve in
the future.


SITE CIRCULATION/SITE ACCESS OPERATIONS
The site circulation and site access operations were evaluated to ensure that the site provides sufficient
circulation for pedestrian movements and internal traffic. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed Walla Walla
VA Medical Center campus expansion plan. With the expansion, Poplar Street and Chestnut Street will
remain the primary points of access to the campus.


Poplar Street Access
During the site visit, three potential issues were identified at the existing Poplar Street access:

          Intersection sight distance for northbound left-turning traffic
          Curvature, width, and number of northbound lanes for the VA Medical Center Access
          Potential need for a westbound left-turn lane on Poplar Street

Intersection Sight Distance
Based on conversations with the City, VA Medical Center Staff, and field observations, the intersection
sight distance for northbound left-turns looking to the west on Poplar Street appears to be limited.
Poplar Street has a curve west of Avery Street that limits the sight distance. Figure 13 and Figure 12
show pictures looking each direction from the approximate sight distance measurement location.




Figure 13 - Poplar Access Sight Distance Looking      Figure 12 - Poplar Access Sight Distance
         West                                                  Looking East


Field measurements were taken which revealed the intersection sight distance to the west was
approximately 390 feet looking west and approximately 650 feet looking east. The AASHTO policy for

                                                       33                                 Kittelson & Associates, Inc

Transportation Impact Analysis


intersection sight distance requires 335 feet for 30 mph and 390 feet for 35 mph. Based on these
requirements, adequate intersection sight distance is provided, although it only meets the minimum
standard to the west. Because the sight distance is close to the minimum requirement, and speeds on
Poplar Street could be greater than the posted speed of 35 mph west of Avery, relocating the fence on
the south side of Poplar Street west of Avery Street back by about 5-10 feet should be considered. In
addition, trimming some of the landscaping on the corner will help maintain the intersection sight
distance. It is estimated that these changes would provide approximately 60 feet of additional sight
distance which would help drivers exiting at the Avery access and accommodate up to 40 mph speeds.

Access Driveway Alignment and Approach Lanes
The curvature of the VA Medical Center Access was also reviewed. The curvature at the intersection is
very tight and limits speeds to approximately 10-15 mph. Figure 14 shows a picture of the curvature of
the northbound driveway approach to the Avery Street/Poplar Street intersection.




Figure 14 - Avery VA Access Looking Toward Poplar

As shown in Figure 14, the northbound approach is relatively narrow and has a single northbound lane.
As traffic volumes increase, the delay for northbound left-turns is expected to increase substantially
and with only one lane available, right-turning vehicles will be blocked by left-turning vehicles. For this
                                                      34                                Kittelson & Associates, Inc

reason, consideration should be given in the long-term to modify the approach to provide a separate a
northbound left-turn lane and wider lanes to accommodate the tight curvature.

Need For Turn Lanes
The need for turn lanes at the Avery Street/Poplar Street intersection was evaluated using the
guidelines published in NCHRP Report 457, Evaluating Intersection Improvements: An Engineering Study
Guide. (Reference 5) The results of this evaluation are summarized in Table 7.

                                  Table 7: Avery Street/Poplar Street Turn Lane Analysis

                                                                       Yes (Just over min

                                                                           threshold)




As shown in Table 7, separate turn lanes are not warranted under the 2015 condition. Widening the
northbound approach from the VA Medical Center to provide two lanes to separate the northbound
left turns is warranted under 2035 conditions and, therefore, should be considered given the high
delays projected for the left-turn movement in the long-term future.

A westbound left-turn lane on Poplar Street was found to be just over the warrant threshold during the
weekday p.m. peak hour. It is likely the westbound left-turn lane would meet warrants during the
weekday a.m. peak hour which campus staff arrive, although that condition was not evaluated. The
need for this lane should be reviewed in the long term once the future VA Medical Center buildings are
reused and a more accurate assessment can be done.


PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION FINDINGS
Pedestrian circulation was review at a conceptual level based on the current site plan. The following are
recommendations for consideration when preparing the final site plan:

                While the sidewalk system provides key connections between uses, there are many
                sections of sidewalk missing which restrict the ability to access some parts of the campus
                from the access points at Avery Street and Chestnut Street. Some of these missing sections
                of sidewalk include:
                    o Up the hill from the Avery Street access to the new buildings.
                    o Between the parking near the baseball bleachers and the Avery access road.
                With the planned nursing home, a sidewalk along the south side of Wainwright Drive
                should also be considered depending on the final design of the facility.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of this study indicate that the proposed Walla Walla VA Campus expansion can be
completed while maintaining acceptable traffic operations and safety at the study intersections,
assuming provision of the recommended mitigation measures. The evaluation resulted in the following
findings and recommendations:


FINDINGS

Year 2013 Existing Conditions
                All of the study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service during the
                weekday p.m. peak hours.
                A review of historical crash data did not reveal any specific patterns or trends in the site
                vicinity that require mitigation associated with this project.
                The intersection sight distance for northbound left-turns at the Poplar Street/Avery Street
                intersection is limited to the west because of a fence and the curvature of Poplar Street.
                The intersection sight distance is limited to the minimum required 390 ft.


Year 2015 Background Traffic Conditions
                No other significant roadway or development projects are planned in the vicinity of the VA
                medical center.
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2015 background conditions.


Proposed Development Plan
                The proposed expansion (expected to be completed by 2015) is estimated to generate
                approximately 460 daily net new trips of which 45 net new trips (20 inbound, 25 outbound)
                are projected to occur during the weekday p.m. peak hour. With future re-use of the
                existing medical and office buildings, the site in total is estimated to generate
                approximately 3,250 net new daily trips of which approximately 330 would occur during
                the weekday p.m. peak hour (110 inbound and 220 outbound).


Year 2015 Total Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2015 total traffic conditions with the developed of the proposed project.

Conclusions and Recommendations


                Additional turn lanes are not warranted at the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection
                during the weekday p.m. peak hour under 2015 total traffic conditions.


Year 2035 Background Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2035 background traffic conditions.


Year 2035 Total Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under 2035 total traffic conditions with the exception of the Poplar Street/Avery
                Street intersection.
                The northbound left-turn onto Poplar Street from Avery Street is projected to operate at
                LOS F with the additional traffic generated from the proposed re-use of the existing
                buildings.
                A westbound left-turn lane from Poplar Street onto Avery Street is warranted during the
                2035 weekday p.m. peak hour. It is likely that the volumes and operations at this
                intersection will also meet turn lane warrants during the weekday a.m. peak hour when
                staff arrive although that scenario was not specifically evaluated as part of this study.
                A planning-level signal warrant analysis indicated that the Poplar Street/Avery Street
                intersection is projected to meet traffic signal warrants although the volumes only exceed
                the warrant thresholds by a small amount.


Site Circulation/Site-Access Operations
          Vehicular Circulation
                With the expansion, signage will need to be updated to direct visitors to the public parking
                areas.
                The following improvements were identified under the 2035 Total Traffic conditions at the
                Avery Street/Poplar Street entrance:
                    o Intersection sight distance could be improved by relocating the existing VA Medical
                      Center fence along Poplar Street to the west of Avery Street approximately 10 feet
                      further to the south in the vicinity Avery Street and the Poplar Street curve.
                    o Widening of the northbound approach to provide a separate northbound left-turn
                      lane and through-right lane is warranted based on the 2035 total traffic conditions
                      and will reduce the delay to right-turning vehicles at the intersection.
                    o A westbound left-turn lane is not warranted under 2015 conditions but does meet
                      warrants under 2035 conditions based on the assumptions of this analysis. It is not

Conclusions and Recommendations


                         recommend that this lane be constructed at this time but the need for this left-turn
                         lane should be re-examined in the long-term once future traffic volumes are
                         confirmed and the specific reuses for the existing VA buildings are known.
                The access location for the proposed state nursing home at the intersection of Wainwright
                Drive and the roadway accessing the baseball bleacher parking lot is expected to operate
                acceptably with stop-control on the northbound and southbound approaches.


          Pedestrian Circulation
                While the sidewalk system provides key connections between uses, there are many
                sections of sidewalk missing internally on site which restricts the ability to access some
                parts of the campus from Avery Street and Chestnut Street. Some of these missing sections
                of sidewalk include:
                    o Up the hill from the Avery Street access to the proposed new buildings.
                    o Between the parking located near the baseball bleachers and the Avery access road.
                With the planned state nursing home, a sidewalk along the south side of Wainwright Drive
                should also be considered depending on the final design of the facility.


RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings of this analysis, the following are recommended with the Walla Walla VA Medical
Center expansion:


          Vehicular Traffic Recommendations
                The following improvements are recommended at the               Avery Street/Poplar Street
                entrance:
                    Near-Term
                    o Consider relocation of the VA Medical Center fence along Poplar Street to the west
                      of Avery Street approximately 10 feet south between the Avery Street and the curve
                      in Poplar Street to improve intersection sight distance for northbound vehicles. Trim
                      the trees and shrubbery as necessary. This is not required to meet minimum
                      requirements.
                    Long-Term (Upon Reuse and Occupation of the Existing Buildings)
                    o Widen the northbound approach at the Poplar Street/Avery Street intersection to
                      provide a separate northbound left-turn lane and through-right lane. Provide
                      approximately 170 feet of left-turn storage.

Conclusions and Recommendations


                    o Re-examine the need for a westbound left-turn lane at the Poplar Street/Avery
                      Street intersection in the long-term once future traffic volumes evolve and the
                      specific reuse for the existing buildings is known, or if a safety issue is identified.
                    o Re-evaluate the need for a traffic signal at the Poplar Street/Avery Street
                      intersection once the existing building are reused and fully occupied.
                Update signing to direct vehicles to appropriate parking and buildings on site, particularly
                from the Avery Street access.


          Pedestrian Access Recommendations
               Review sidewalk connectivity between the buildings and the campus accesses to ensure
               pedestrians have a connected and continuous route from the off-site sidewalk system.

Description of Level-of-Service
         Methods and Criteria
APPENDIX B LEVEL-OF-SERVICE CONCEPT
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from "A" to "F".1


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
The six level-of-service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table B1.
Additionally, Table B2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per
vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service "D" is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

Table B-1            Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

   Level of
   Service                                                             Average Delay per Vehicle
                   Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and most
      A            vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
                   Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally
                   occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of
      B            average delay.
                   Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher
                   delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
      C            The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
                   Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of
                   congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
                   length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle
      D            failures are noticeable.
                   Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually
                   considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long
       E           cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                   Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This condition
                   often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures.
       F           Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service levels associated
with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B3. A quantitative definition of level of service
for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B4. Using this definition, Level of Service "E" is
generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is that
drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on the
minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying
acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the HCM
level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

Project:       City of Florence Transportation System Plan Update ­ Project Memorandum #4 
Subject:       Existing Conditions, Deficiencies, and Future Needs 
 

This  memorandum  includes  three  sections  that  have  been  prepared  as  draft  chapters  for  the  City 
of Florence 2010 Transportation System Plan (TSP) Update. The sections of this memorandum are: 
Transportation  System  Inventory,  Current  Transportation  Conditions,  and  Future  Transportation 
Conditions.  The  findings  highlight  existing  and  future  transportation  system  deficiencies,  but  do 
not  include  solutions  to  identified  deficiencies.  Preferred  project  alternatives  will  be  developed 
and  prioritized  in  Project  Memorandum  #9,  Costs  and  Priorities,  and  will  be  included  in  the  Draft 
TSP Update. 

The  current  TSP  (Reference  1)  was  adopted  in  2002  and  based  the  existing  conditions  analysis  on 
population  data  from  1998  and  employment  data  from  1996.  A  reformatted  version  was  reissued 
in July 2008 that includes consistency in text, formatting, and includes all adopted amendments to 
the  text  and maps  since  original  adoption  in  2002;  however,  the  housing  and  economic  data  were 
not  updated.  Because  Florence  is  located  on  the  Oregon  Coast,  the  City  is  experiencing  growth 
pressure  from  both  land  development  as  well  as  the  increasing  summertime  tourist  traffic.  Based 
on  anticipated  changes  in  population  and  summertime  travel  demand,  it  is  appropriate  that  the 
existing  system  and  a  forecast  of  future  conditions  be  evaluated  for  its  performance  in  meeting 
the daily travel needs of the community. This memorandum includes the following elements:  

      ·   Identification of existing transportation inventory and services;  
      ·   Analysis of existing transportation conditions;  
      ·   Forecast of future transportation needs; and, 
      ·   A summary of historic funding sources and potential future funding sources.   

Figure  41  shows  a  street  map  of  Florence  and  the  study  area,  designated  within  the  city  limits 
and  urban  growth  boundary  (UGB).  Based  on  the  requirements  of  the  Transportation  Planning 
Rule (TPR), the focus of the existing conditions analysis is on significant roadways (arterials or

collectors)  and  intersections  of  these  streets,  as  well  as  other  transport  facilities  and  services, 
including  pedestrian,  bicycle,  public  transportation,  rail  service,  air  service,  pipelines  and  water 
service.  

Transportation System Inventory
This  section  describes  the  current  performance  and  operational  deficiencies  of  the  City's 
transportation system, covering the automobile, pedestrian, bicycle, public transportation, freight, 
air, marine, and pipeline/transmission transportation modes. 

STREET SYSTEM

Highways  and  streets  are  the  primary  means  of  mobility  for  Florence's  citizens,  serving  the 
majority of trips over multiple modes. Pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists all utilize public roads 
for  the  vast  majority  of  their  trips.  These  public  facilities  are  controlled  by  multiple  jurisdictions 
and are classified based on traffic loads, permitted speeds, and accessibility. 

Jurisdiction

Public  roads  within  the  study  area  are  operated  by  three  different  jurisdictions:  the  City  of 
Florence,  Lane  County  and  the  Oregon  Department  of  Transportation  (ODOT).  Each  jurisdiction 
is responsible for the following: 

    ·    Determining a road's functional classification;  
    ·    Defining a roadway's major design and multimodal features; 
    ·    Maintenance; and,  
    ·    Approving construction and access permits. 

Coordination  is  required  among  the  jurisdictions  to  ensure  that  the  transportation  system  is 
planned,  maintained,  and  expanded  to  safely  meet  the  needs  of  travelers  in  the  area.  Figure  42 
shows  the  jurisdiction  of  roadways  and  Figure  43  shows  the  functional  classifications  of 
roadways in and around Florence as defined by the City.

Roadway Functional Classification

A  roadway's  functional  classification  determines  its  role  in  the  transportation  system,  as  well  as  its 
width, rightofway dedications, driveway (access) spacing requirements, types of pedestrian and 
bicycle  facilities  provided.  The  functional  classification  is  typically  established  by  the  city  or 
county based on the following hierarchy:  

         Arterials  are  intended  to  serve  high  volumes  of  traffic,  particularly  through  traffic,  at 
         relatively  high  speeds.  They  also  serve  truck  movements  and  typically  emphasize  traffic 
         movement over local land access.  

         Collectors  serve  traffic  from  the  local  street  system  and  distribute  it  to  the  arterial  street 
         system. These roadways provide a balance between traffic movement and land access, and 
         should be designed as best to facilitate traffic circulation throughout the City. 

         Local streets provide land access and carry locally generated traffic at relatively low speeds 
         to  the  collector  street  system.  Local  streets  should  provide  connectivity  through 
         neighborhoods, but should be designed to discourage cutthrough vehicular traffic. 

The existing Florence functional classifications from the 2002 TSP are shown in Figure 43.  

ODOT  has  a  separate  classification  system  for  its  highways,  which  guide  the  planning, 
management,  and  investment  for  state  highways.  ODOT's  categories,  from  highest  to  lowest,  are 
Interstate, Statewide, Regional, and District highways. According to the Oregon Highway Plan (OHP) 
(Reference  2),  both  US  101  and  OR  126  are  classified  as  Statewide  Highways  on  the  National 
Highway System (NHS). The OHP defines Statewide Highways on the NHS as follows: 

         Statewide  Highways  (NHS)  typically  provide  interurban  and  interregional  mobility  and 
         provide  connections  to  larger  urban  areas,  ports,  and  major  recreation  areas  that  are  not 
         directly  served  by  Interstate  Highways.  A  secondary  function  is  to  provide  connections 
         for  intraurban  and  intraregional  trips.  The  management  objective  is  to  provide  safe  and 
         efficient,  highspeed,  continuousflow  operation.  In  constrained  and  urban  areas, 
         interruptions to flow should be minimal. Inside Special Transportation Areas (STAs), local 
         access may also be a priority. 

The  OHP  designates  the  portion  of  US  101  between  OR  126  and  the  Siuslaw  River  Bridge  (MP 
190.23 to 190.84) as a Freight Route and as a STA. The OHP defines a STA as a district of compact 
development  where  the  need  for  appropriate  local  access  outweighs  the  considerations  of 
highway  mobility  except  on  designated  Freight  Routes  where  highway  mobility  has  greater 
importance. 

The  OHP  designates  the  portion  of  US  101  between  30th  Street  and  OR  126  (MP  188.97  to  190.23) 
as a Urban Business Area, which are defined as areas where vehicular accessibility is important to 
continued  economic  viability.  In  areas  with  a  posted  speed  above  35  miles  per  hour,  the  OHP 
states  that  a  management  plan  is  required  to  balance  the  needs  for  vehicular,  pedestrian,  bicycle, 
and transit accessibility in an Urban Business Area.

Roadway Street Section Standards

The  current  TSP  also  identifies  roadway  cross  section  elements  that  should  be  included  for  each 
classification.  Each  classification  allows  some  flexibility  with  respect  to  parking,  bike  lanes  and 
lane  width,  and  is  subdivided  into  minimum,  maximum  and  typical  cross  sections.  The  cross 
section design elements from the original 2002 TSP are summarized and attached in Attachment "A." 

Roadway Segment Conditions

The roadway segment conditions were reviewed for approximate width and pavement condition. 
This  data  was  field  verified  and  confirmed  with  the  roadway  inventory  information  provided  by 
the  City  of  Florence  Public  Works.  Table  1  summarizes  the  major  arterial,  minor  arterial,  and 
collector  roadways  in  Florence  and  identifies  the  jurisdiction  for  each  roadway,  as  well  as  the 
approximate pavement width and condition.  

Street  segments  were  surveyed  and  their  condition  summarized  where  data  was  available  by  the 
City  of  Florence.  Table  1  below  shows  the  condition  of  some  of  the  major  roadways  within 
Florence.  As  shown,  the  City  of  Florence  uses  the  Pavement  Condition  Index  (PCI)  to  describe 
pavement conditions.

        4 Average of several subsections reported in the report. 

The  PCI  is  a  measurement  of  pavement  conditions  that  ranges  from  0  to  100.  A  brand  new  road 
would  have  a  PCI  of  100,  while  a  failed  road  (requiring  complete  reconstruction)  would  have  a 
PCI under 10. The average PCI for City streets is 71.  

Four  of  the  major  study  roadways  identified  above  have  a  PCI  well  below  the  City's  average:  9th 
Street, Rhododendron Drive, 15th Street, and Quince Street..  

For both state facilities in Florence, ODOT used the Distress rating procedure which then converts 
to  a  GFP  rating  (GFP  stands  for  GoodFairPoor).  Each  section  is  given  a  condition  score  ranging 
in  value  from  0  to  100,  estimated  to  the  nearest  5  points,  based  on  the  surface  distresses  present 
and, to a lesser degree, ride quality.

Other Roadway Deficiencies

In  addition  to  the  existing  roadway  conditions  and  deficiencies  identified  above,  the  following 
issues  were  identified  through  general  review  of  the  roadway  network  and  in  consultation  with 
City of Florence staff and Project Advisory Committee members: 

    ·    Several  local  streets  are  relatively  disconnected  in  certain  areas,  thereby  creating  greater 
         reliance on US 101; 
    ·    Speeding issues were identified along Spruce Street (posted speed limit of 25 mph); 
    ·    Several locations for potential wildlife crossings were identified along US 101;  
    ·    Onstreet  parking  should  be  limited  in  the  vicinity  of  the  8th  Street/Maple  Street 
         intersection, particularly on the east side fronting the library;  
    ·    Transportation  system  constraints  on  economic  development  may  impact  small 
         businesses; 
    ·    Congestion,  parking  challenges,  and  general  traffic  flow  issues  have  been  identified 
         within the Old Town district, which may warrant the potential analysis of a system of one
         way streets;  
    ·    Concerns have been raised for lack of ADA accessible parking along Bay Street; 
    ·    Potential for relocating the planned traffic signal on US 101 at 30th Street to 27th Street; 
    ·    Addressing  environmental  and  utility  issues  in  the  planned  street  network  in  the  9th 
         Street area; and, 
    ·    Addressing  street  connectivity  and  provision  of  utilities  in  the  southeast  portion  of  the 
         UGB. 

TSUNAMI EVACUATION ROUTES

Please refer to Attachment "B" for a map of identified tsunami evacuation routes prepared by the 
Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI). 

PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM

Pedestrian facilities serve a variety of needs, identified below:  

    ·    Relatively  short  trips  (under  a  mile)  to  major  pedestrian  attractors,  such  as  schools,  parks, 
         and public facilities;  
    ·    Recreational trips--for example, jogging or hiking--and circulation within parklands;  
    ·    Access to transit (generally trips under 1/2mile to bus stops); and,  
    ·    Commute  trips,  where  mixeduse  development  is  provided  and  people  have  chosen  to 
         live near where they work.  

Pedestrian  facilities  should  be  integrated  with  transit  stops  and  effectively  separate  pedestrians 
from  vehicular  traffic.  Furthermore,  pedestrian  facilities  should  provide  continuous  connections 
among  neighborhoods,  employment  areas,  and  nearby  pedestrian  attractors.  Pedestrian  facilities 
usually  refer  to  sidewalks  or  paths,  but  also  include  pedestrian  crossings  for  high  volume

roadways.  The  existing  pedestrian  network  serving  Florence  is  shown  in  Figure  44,  along  with 
major activity centers where higher concentrations of pedestrians can be found.  

As  Figure  44  shows,  the  majority  of  the  arterial  and  collector  roadways  in  Florence  provide 
sidewalks, though there are some significant gaps in the pedestrian network.  

The following additional issues were identified through general review of the pedestrian network 
and in consultation with City of Florence staff and PAC members: 

    ·    The  Citys  bicycle  and  pedestrian  facilities  are  discontinuous,  thereby  discouraging  travel 
         via these modes. 

    ·    Potential  for  a  pedestrian  signal  and  crosswalk  at  the  9th  Street/Kingwood  Street 
         intersection  (this  is  a  primary  emergency  corridor  and  has  been  identified  as  an  issue  for 
         bus drivers); 

    ·    Crosswalks  should  be  considered  along  Maple  Street  and  Kingwood  Street  for  improved 
         accessibility to the library; 

    ·    Crosswalks  should  be  considered  along  US  101  between  20th  Street  and  32nd  Street  to 
         improve safety;  

    ·    A crosswalk should be considered on Bay Street in front of the Coffee Roasters (just east of 
         the US 101 bridge overcrossing); and, 

    ·    In  general,  the  City  has  raised  concerns  about  pedestrian  crossings  across  Kingwood 
         Street.

Pedestrian Crossings

In  the  state  of  Oregon,  all  unsignalized  intersections  are  considered  legal  cross  walks  and  motor 
vehicles  are  required  to  yield  the  right  of  way  to  pedestrians  to  allow  them  to  cross.  However, 
compliance is not consistent and pedestrians may have difficulty crossing high volume roadways. 
Protected pedestrian crossings along the highways can be found at the following intersections: 

    ·    US  101/2nd  Street  ­  striped  pedestrian  crossing  (a  Rapid  Rectangular  Flashing  Beacon 
         [RRFB] and raised pedestrian refuge installation is currently under construction); 
    ·    US 101/Rhododendron Drive ­ signalized pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US 101, south side of  6th Street ­striped pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US 101, south side of 7th Street ­striped pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US  101,  north  of  7th  Street  ­  midblock  RRFB  and  pedestrian  refuge  installation  is 
         currently under construction between 7th and 8th Streets; 
    ·    US 101, south side of 8th Street ­striped pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US 101/OR 126 ­ signalized pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US 101, south side of 15th Street ­striped pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US  101/17th  Street  ­  protected  striped  pedestrian  crossing  (midblock  RRFB  installation 
         currently under construction between 17th and 18th Streets); 
    ·    US 101, north side of 18th Street ­ striped pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US 101/21st Street ­ signalized pedestrian crossing; 
    ·    US 101, north side of 30th Street ­ existing RRFB and raised pedestrian refuge installed; 
    ·    US 101/35th Street ­ signalized pedestrian crossing; and, 
    ·    OR 126, west side of Quince Street ­striped pedestrian crossing. 

The  City  has  recently  considered  future  installation  of  RRFB  pedestrian  crossings  at  12th  Street 
and  midblock  between  15th  and  16th  Streets,  though  no  formal  design  has  been  prepared  and  no 
funding source has been identified.

leaders  and  local,  state,  and  federal  governments  to  improve  safety  and  health  of  children  by 
enabling  and  encouraging  them  to  walk  and  bike  to  school.  SRTS  programs  aim  on  reducing 
traffic  and  air  pollution,  and  providing  safer  and  more  accessible  facilities  and  transportation 
choices to children, thus encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle in their early age. 

Safe Routes to School have not been identified and improved in Florence, resulting in greater 
automobile trips for students to school. There are currently no SRTS programs active in the City 
of Florence.

Additional school and pedestrian concerns are listed below as identified by City of Florence staff: 

    ·    School bus concerns: 
             o    Intersection visibility on 9th Street/Kingwood Street is not adequate;  
             o    In general, widening of roadways to accommodate bus turning radii; 
             o    In general, ensure that sidewalks are present at school bus stops; 
    ·    Additional sidewalks are needed for pedestrians near the schools; and, 
    ·    Congestion  around  the  elementary  and  middle  school  may  warrant  the  need  for 
         additional parking areas and larger dropoff areas. 

BICYCLE SYSTEM

Similar  to  pedestrian  facilities,  bicycle  facilities  (dedicated  bicycle  lanes  in  the  paved  roadway, 
multiuse paths shared with pedestrians, etc.) serve a variety of trips. These include:  

    ·    Trips to major attractors, such as schools, parks and open spaces, retail centers, and public 
         facilities; 
    ·    Commute trips, where changing and showering facilities are provided at the workplace;  
    ·    Recreational trips; and, 
    ·    Access to transit, where bicycle storage facilities are available at the stop, or where space is 
         available on busmounted bicycle racks.  
As  this  list  suggests,  supporting  bicycling  as  a  viable  alternative  to  the  automobile  requires  more 
than  simply  providing  bicycle  lanes.  Support  facilities,  such  as  secure  parking  and  worksite 
changing/showering  facilities,  are  also  needed  before  many  potential  users  will  consider  the 
bicycle trip as a practical alternative.  

The Oregon Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan (Reference 5) identifies four basic bikeway designs: 

    ·    Shared  roadway  ­  Bicycles  and  vehicles  share  the  same  roadway  area  under  this 
         classification.  The  shared  roadway  facility  is  best  used  where  there  is  minimal  vehicle 
         traffic to conflict with bicycle traffic. 
    ·    Shoulder  bikeways  ­  This  bicycle  facility  consists  of  roadways  with  paved  shoulders  to 
         accommodate bicycle traffic. 
    ·    Bike  lanes  ­  Separate  lane  adjacent  to  the  vehicle  travel  lane  for  the  exclusive  use  of 
         bicyclists are considered bike lanes. 
    ·    Multiuse  path  ­  A  facility  separated  from  the  roadway  by  open  space  or  a  barrier  that  is 
         typically used by pedestrians, joggers, skaters, and bicyclists. 

Dedicated  bicycle  facilities  should  be  provided  along  major  streets  where  automobile  traffic 
speeds  are  significantly  higher  than  bicycle  speeds.  Bicycle  facilities  should  connect  residential 
neighborhoods to schools, retail centers, and employment areas. However, allowing bicycle traffic 
to mix with automobile traffic is acceptable where the average daily traffic (ADT) on a roadway is 
less  than  3,000  vehicles  per  day  and  vehicular  speeds  are  low,  according  to  the  Oregon  Bicycle  and 
Pedestrian  Plan.  Lower  volume  roadways  should  be  considered  for  bike  shoulders  or  lanes  if

anticipated  to  be  used  by  children  as  part  of  any  potential  future  Safe  Routes  to  School  program. 
In  areas  where  no  street  connection  currently  exists  or  where  substantial  outofdirection  travel 
would  otherwise  be  required,  a  multiuse  path  may  be  appropriate  to  provide  adequate  facilities 
for bicyclists.  

Figure  45  shows  the  existing  bicycle  facilities  in  Florence  as  well  as  in  the  immediate  area 
surrounding the UGB. 

There  is  currently  no  separate  bicycle  plan  for  City  of  Florence.  The  original  2002  TSP  indicates 
that  local  bicycle  system  improvements  should  be  consistent  with  the  State  of  Oregon  Bicycle 
Facilities  Master  Plan.  The  following  additional  issues  were  identified  through  general  review  of 
the bicycle network and in consultation with City of Florence staff: 

    ·    The  Citys  bicycle  and  pedestrian  facilities  are  discontinuous,  thereby  discouraging  travel 
         via these modes; 

    ·    Heceta  Beach  Road  as  well  as  Rhododendron  Drive  currently  lack  facilities  for  bicycles 
         and pedestrians, and travel speeds have been observed to be high; and, 

    ·    US 101 south of OR 126 lacks bicycle lanes near and on the bridge.

As  shown  in  Table  2,  local  bus  service  is  provided  throughout  most  of  the  day  with  onehour 
headways,  connecting  between  major  commercial  and  institutional  activities.  However,  the  lack 
of  services  during  morning  peak  hours  essentially  puts  a  barrier  to  residents  commuting  to  work 
by bus. Also, no stops are available along US 101. 

Porter  Stage  Lines  provides  only  two  bus  services  each  day  to  both  Eugene  and  Coos  Bay  during 
weekdays. Residents depending on transit services would be at a commuter disadvantage to have 
outofFlorence employment.

In  addition  to  the  fixedschedule  services,  various  organizations  and  programs  provide 
transportation  services  to  senior,  disabled,  and  people  in  need  of  medical  services  in  and  out  of 
the Florence area. Several of these services include: 

    ·    Friends of Florence Van 
    ·    Medicaid Medical Rides 
    ·    Veterans Transportation 
    ·    Florence Medical Escort Taxi Program 
    ·    Senior and Disable Services Volunteer Medical Rides 

Transportation is also provided  by some retirement centers. The most uptodate information can 
be found at http://www.ci.florence.or.us/transportation.cfm. 

Also  identified  by  City  of  Florence  staff  and  the  project  team,  one  significant  deficiency  in  the 
transit  system  is  the  lack  of  transit  service  to  the  northwest  quadrant  of  the  City.  This  includes 
recreational  areas  such  as  the  North  Jetty,  Driftwood  Shores,  and  Heceta  Beach.  There  is  also  a 
lack of transit service to the City of Yachats to the north. 

Community Transit Plan Update

The Community Transit Plan was written in 2000 prior to the establishment of Rhody Express bus 
service,  and  this  plan's  horizon  date  is  2010.  It  is  time  to  update  the  Community  Transit  Plan  to 
evaluate  existing  service  and  plan  for  the  future  of  transit  in  Florence  and  perhaps  future  public 
bus  service  to  Eugene.  The  Community  Transit  Plan  will  be  updated  as  a  standalone  document 
and incorporated into the Updated TSP. 

General Transit and Ridership Survey Results

The  City  of  Florence  conducted  several  surveys  across  a  variety  of  groups  to  assess  the  current 
Rhody  Express  service  a  general  transit  survey  (mailed  to  all  residents  in  utility  bills)  and  a 
ridership  survey  (given  exclusively  to  riders  of  the  Rhody  Express).  Survey  results  are 
summarized  below,  along  with  some  general  characteristics  of  Florence  residents  to  provide 
additional context. Attachment "C" contains copies of the various surveys as well as the results. 

Characteristics  of  Florence  residents  (based  on  200509  American  Community  Survey  5year 
rolling averages): 

    ·    38% of population is age 65+ 
    ·    37% of population is employed 
    ·    7.3% of workingage population in the labor force is unemployed (probably higher now) 
    ·    Median household income is $35,670 
    ·    13% of households have children under 18 years of age 
    ·    Data on percent of population with disabilities not available

Statistics and Findings of the General Transit Survey

    ·    71% live in a household with a retired person 
    ·    28% live in a household with an employed person 
    ·    6% live in a household with K12 students 
    ·    11% live in a household with a disabled person 
There  were  342  survey  responses  to  the  General  Transit  survey  mailed  to  residents  (6.7%  of 
Florence households). Households with retirees are considerably overrepresented in the sample.  

The  typical  survey  respondent  is  aware  that  Rhody  Express  service  exists  (95%  aware),  but  has 
never ridden it (75% of households, 76% of people). 

A  majority  of  survey  respondents  (61%)  say  they  would  ride  the  Rhody  Express  if  it  was  more 
convenient.  Mostdesired  improvements  are  expanded  route  coverage  (52%),  weekend  service 
(39%), more frequent service (33%), and expanded AM/PM service hours (23%/26%). 

Respondents  who  are  employed  or  in  school  typically  drive  alone  (67%),  walk  (21%),  or  carpool 
(9%). Nearly all (88%) of these work or study in Florence. Of those who travel away from Florence 
for work or study, 84% say they would use transit service if it was available and convenient. 

Statistics and Findings of the Ridership Survey:

There  were  36  survey  responses  to  the  Ridership  survey.  The  typical  Rhody  Express  rider  is  a 
senior  citizen  or  a  person  with  a  disability  who  uses  the  bus  to  go  shopping  and  uses  the  service 
more than once a week. 

Survey  respondents  were  persons  with  disabilities  or  their  companions  (45%),  senior  citizens 
(33%),  unemployed  persons  (11%),  and  employed  persons  (11%).  No  students  or  tourists 
responded to the survey. 

Rhody  Express  is  most  commonly  used  for  shopping  trips  (80%  of  respondents  use  it  this  way), 
while  about  25%  of  respondents  use  it  for  social  trips  and  about  25%  use  it  to  get  to  and  from 
medical appointments (respondents could pick multiple trip purposes). About 2/3 of respondents 
use  it  more  than  once  a  week,  while  85%  use  it  at  least  once  a  week.  44%  of  respondents  require 
some  sort  of  assistance  when  using  Rhody  Express  (e.g.,  stop  announcements,  companion, 
wheelchair lift). 

Respondents'  mostdesired  service  improvement  by  far  was  weekend  service  (84%).  Expanded 
AM  service  hours,  more  frequent  service,  and  expanded  route  coverage  were  also  desired  by  25­
30% of respondents, respectively (respondents could pick multiple desired improvements). 

For  57%  of  respondents,  Rhody  Express  is  their  only  transportation  option.  91%  of  those 
providing  an  answer  to  the  question  have  household  incomes  less  than  $30,000  (compared  to 
Florence's  median  income  of  approximately  $35,000),  while  41%  have  household  incomes  less 
than $10,000.

Statistics and Findings of the Employer Survey

The  City  of  Florence  also  conducted  a  survey  of  three  major  employers  in  Florence  to  assess  the 
potential  for  the  Rhody  Express  to  provide  service  for  journeytowork  trips.  The  survey  results 
are summarized below. 

The  City  surveyed  employees  at  three  major  employers:  Peace  Health,  Fred  Meyer,  and  Grocery 
Outlet,  with  48,  14,  and  12  responses  received  from  the  respective  locations.  Most  respondents 
(ranging from 93% at Fred Meyer to 67% at Grocery Outlet) do not have the ability to adjust their 
work  schedule.  A  large  majority  of  the  respondents  drive  alone  exclusively  (ranging  from  92%  at 
Peace  Health  to  75%  at  Grocery  Outlet),  some  carpool  with  another  employee  or  get  a  ride  to 
work,  and  a  few  walk  or  bike.  Those  who  drive  alone  do  so  because  the  bus  is  not  available,  they 
need  their  car  for  personal  errands  or  to  save  time,  they  have  no  one  to  share  a  ride  with,  and/or 
(particularly  for  the  retail  employees)  they  have  an  irregular  work  schedule.  Fred  Meyer  and 
Peace  Health  employees  would  be  most  likely  to  change  mode  if  the  bus  was  more  convenient,  if 
a guaranteed ride home program was available, or if there was the opportunity to share a ride.  

None  of  the  offered  strategies  resonated  strongly  with  Grocery  Outlet  employees;  however,  they 
would  be  least  unlikely  to  change  modes  if  fuel  prices  increased,  a  guaranteed  ride  home 
program  was  available,  or  ridesharing  opportunities  existed.  Virtually  all  of  the  respondents 
(96%) were aware of Rhody Express. 

Statistics and Findings of the Delivery Service and Jurisdiction Staff Survey

The  City  of  Florence  also  conducted  a  survey  of  a  wide  range  of  service  providers  and 
jurisdictional  staff  to  assess  the  current  transportation  system,  its  operation  both  today  and  in  the 
future, existing or anticipated future issues, and any recommendations for improvement. 

Surveys were sent to the following 16 service providers, 11 (*) of which provided responses. 

    ·    Central Coast Disposal (*)                                ·   ODOT Operations and Maintenance 
    ·    County Transfer and Recycling (*)                             Staff (*) 
    ·    FEDEX                                                     ·   Port of Siuslaw 
    ·    Florence Airport (*)                                      ·   Rhody Express (*) 
    ·    Public Works Director (*)                                 ·   River City Taxi (*) 
    ·    Public Works GIS Manager (*)                              ·   Siuslaw School Bus Service 
    ·    Lane County Operations and                                ·   US Post Office (*) 
         Maintenance Staff (*)                                     ·   Western Lane Ambulance Services 
While  the  wide  range  of  service  providers  and  their  respective  focus  area(s)  resulted  in  disparate 
responses, there were a few consistent themes that emerged.  

    1. Service  providers  generally  noted  that  the  local  street  system  within  the  City  functions 
       well  today,  and  local  knowledge  of  the  area  allows  many  service  providers  to  use  local 
       streets and avoid congestion on the highways (thus avoiding higher volumes of traffic and 
       "friction" on the system, improving efficiency).

    2. Several  service  providers  noted  that  the  fivelane  crosssection  of  US  101  should  be 
        extended north through the Munsel Lake Road intersection (and possibly to Heceta Beach 
        Road)  to  better  manage  mobility  needs  through  this  section  of  the  highway  and  improve 
        accessibility  to/from  local  side  streets  and/or  driveways  in  this  area.  Some  noted  that  they 
        expect a larger proportion of future growth in the City to occur in this area. 
    3. There  is  a  need  for  a  greater  number  of  multiuse  paths  with  improved  connectivity  to 
        address  observed  elevated  levels  of  nonmotorized  modes  of  transportation.  Some 
        identified a need for increased bicyclist education to help reduce conflicts. 
    4. While  the  local  street  system  operates  well  and  is  relatively  well  connected,  maintenance 
        of  the  roadways  themselves  and  the  need  to  find  better/increased  sources  of  funding  for 
        road maintenance and improvements is a concern. 
    5. In general, future funding sources for respective services are a concern. 
    6. General concerns raised about the street system include: 
             a. Bicycles conflicting with trucks 
             b. Campers/RVs cause congestion, particularly in the summertime 
             c. Traffic congestion on the Siuslaw River bridge during summer 
    7. Many concerns regarding the pedestrian/bicycle system include: 
             a. Need  for  more  multiuse  paths  to  separate  these  modes  from  motorists  and 
                  improve safety 
             b. Many gaps in sidewalks and many sidewalks in disrepair 
             c. A  "bike  rest  area"  at  the  north  end  of  Siuslaw  River  bridge  may  serve  as  a  nice 
                  tourist diversion to view bay (ODOT seeking funding) 
    8. In Old Town, the following issues were raised: 
             a. Single lane alleys are sometimes difficult to maneuver in 
             b. Bay  Street  time  restrictions  (no  trucks  before  7:00  a.m.)  requires  trucks  to  mix  with 
                  general traffic ­ restriction should be removed 
    9. With regard to the transit/taxi system: 
             a. Funding is always a concern, and inhibits the system from expanding. 
             b. Need to get transit routes out of parking lots and onto public streets 
    10. There  was  also  a  concern  about  the  poor  condition  of  the  stormwater  system  on  US  101 
        from 15th to 35th  (ODOT seeking funds for this estimated $2 million project)

Rail Transportation

There  are  no  rail  facilities  within  the  Florence  UGB.  There  is  currently  no  active  freight  rail 
running  through  Florence  and  the  nearest  passenger  rail  is  located  in  Eugene/Springfield.  The 
Coos  Bay  Rail  Link,  which  ran  between  Eugene  and  Coos  Bay  via  Florence,  crosses  the  Siuslaw 
River  approximately  2.5  miles  east  of  Florence.  This  rail  link  has  been  closed  since  September 
2007, but is expected to reopen sometime in 2011 (Reference 6). 

Passenger Rail

Passenger  rail  service  is  provided  by  Amtrak,  with  the  nearest  stations  located  in 
Eugene/Springfield.  Amtrak  operates  the  Cascades  (Vancouver,  BC  to  Eugene)  and  Coast  Starlight

Air Service

The  Florence  Municipal  Airport  (http://www.airnav.com/airport/6S2)  is  a  general  aviation  facility, 
meaning that it serves flights other than military and scheduled commercial flights. The airport is 
publicly owned by the City of Florence. The airport uses a single runway, which is asphaltpaved 
to  a  length  of  3,000  feet.  Approximately  15  general  aviation  aircraft  are  based  at  the  airport.  No 
instrument landing system exists so operations are limited to visual flight rules (VFR) and there is 
no scheduled service provided by commercial carriers.  

Florence  residents  traveling  on  commercial  flights  will  be  able  to  use  either  the  Portland 
International  Airport  or  the  Eugene  Airport,  located  approximately  200minute  and  90minute 
driving  from  Florence,  respectively.  Commercial  flights  are  also  available  at  the  Southwest 
Oregon Regional Airport in North Bend, approximately one hour south of Florence. 

PIPELINE SERVICE

Florence  does  not  have  any  major  pipeline  transmission  lines.  However,  it  does  have  an 
underground pipeline network for water, sewer, electric, fiber, and cable.  

WATER SERVICE

The  Siuslaw  River  is  the  only  navigable  waterway  located  within  Florence.  Access  is  provided 
through the Port of Siuslaw's boat launch and marina. Other nearby available ports are located in 
Newport,  Tillamook,  Reedsport,  Winchester  Bay,  and  Coos  Bay.  There  is  a  Siuslaw  Water  Trail 
that includes a stop at the Port's boat launch.

Current Transportation Conditions
STUDY INTERSECTION OPERATIONS

This  section  of  the  existing  conditions  assessment  documents  the  current  performance  of  16  key 
intersections within the City of Florence. The study intersections are summarized below. 

ODOT operated and maintained intersections:

Analysis Methodology and Performance Standards

All  operational  analyses  described  in  this  report  were  performed  in  accordance  with  accepted 
stateofthepractice  procedures  stated  in  the  2000  Highway  Capacity  Manual  (Reference  7).  All 
intersection  levelofservice  evaluations  used  the  peak  15minute  flow  rate  during  the  weekday 
p.m.  peak  hour.  Using  the  peak  15minute  flow  rate  ensures  that  this  analysis  is  based  on  a 
reasonable worstcase scenario. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely 
to  occur  for  15  minutes  out  of  each  average  peak  hour.  The  transportation  system  will  likely 
operate under conditions better than those described in this report during all other time periods. 

ODOT Intersections

ODOT  uses  volumetocapacity  ratio  standards  to  assess  intersection  operations.  The  ODOT 
controlled  intersections  within  the  study  area  are  located  along  OR  126  and  US  101,  which  are 
both  designated  as  Statewide  Highways.  OR  126  is  also  designated  as  a  freight  route  within  the 
study  area  while  US  101  is  designated  as  a  freight  route  within  a  Special  Transportation  Area 
(STA)  south  of  OR  126,  as  a  nonfreight  route  within  an  Urban  Business  Area  (UBA)  north  of  OR 
126 and south of 30th Street, and as a nonfreight route north of 30th Street. Attachment "D" contains 
the ODOT Highway Segment Designation map for the City of Florence. 

The  minimum  required  performance  standards  shown  in  Table  4  reflect  the  highway  and  area 
designations shown in Attachment "D" as well as the posted speed limit and traffic control at the 
intersections.  Figure  46  illustrates  the  existing  lane  configurations  and  traffic  control  devices  at 
each of the study intersections.

In  reviewing  Table  4,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  twoway  stopcontrolled  (TWSC)  intersections 
operated  and  maintained  by  ODOT  are  evaluated  using  two  performance  standards;  one  for  the 
highway  approaches  and  one  for  the  minor  street  approaches.  The  major  street  volumeto
capacity  (V/C)  ratios  shown  in  Table  4  reflect  the  mobility  standards  for  OR  126  and  US  101;  in 
addition, in most cases the operating standard for the minor street approach is the same.

City Intersections

The City of Florence has not adopted levelofservice (LOS) or volumetocapacity (V/C) ratio 
standards for signalized or unsignalized intersections, and the 2002 TSP lacks level of service 
standards, as required by the Oregon Transportation Planning Rule (TPR). 

Therefore, the following minimum operating standards were applied to City intersections: 

      ·   LOS "D" is considered acceptable at signalized and allway stop controlled intersections if 
          the V/C ratio is not higher than 1.0 for the sum of critical movements.  
      ·   LOS  "E"  is  considered  acceptable  for  the  poorest  operating  approach  at  twoway  stop 
          intersections. LOS "F" is allowed in situations where a traffic signal is not warranted. 

A  summary  of  the  recommended  performance  standards  at  each  of  the  study  intersections  under 
City jurisdiction is included in Table 5. 

A  description  of  level  of  service  and  the  criteria  by  which  they  are  determined  is  presented  in  Attachment 
"E".  Attachment  "E"  also  indicates  how  level  of  service  is  measured  and  what  is  generally 
considered the acceptable range of level of service.

The  operational  analysis  results  shown  later  in  this  report  were  compared  with  the  mobility 
standards  used  by  ODOT  and  the  City  to  assess  performance  and  potential  areas  for 
improvement. 

Traffic Volumes

Manual  turningmovement  counts  were  conducted  at  12  study  intersections  in  late  August  and 
early  September  2009.  Supplemental  counts  were  conducted  at  four  study  intersections  in  early 
August  2010.  All  counts  were  conducted  on  a  typical  summertime  midweek  day  and  include 
vehicle  turning  movements,  pedestrian  movements,  bicycle  movements,  and  heavy  vehicle 
percentages.  Figure  46  shows  the  existing  lane  configurations  and  traffic  control  devices  in  place 
at  each  of  the  study  intersections.  Attachment  "F"  contains  the  traffic  count  worksheets  used  in  this 
study.  
Seasonal Adjustment Factor
Traffic  volumes  within  Florence  tend  to  fluctuate  by  time  of  year  due  to  seasonal  factors  such  as 
tourist travel. Typically,  transportation facilities are not designed for the highest volume of traffic 
experienced  in  an  hour,  but  instead,  are  designed  for  the  30th  highest  hour  demand  experienced 
over  the  course  of  the  year.  If  demand  on  a  given  transportation  facility  were  measured  every 
hour  in  the  year,  and  the  demands  were  ranked  from  highest  to  lowest,  the  30th  highest  hour 
demand  would  represent  the  condition  for  which  the  system  is  typically  designed  (i.e.  the 
"design hour").   

The  concept  of  the  30th  highest  hour  demand  in  estimating  transportation  or  parking  capacity 
requirements  recognizes  that  it  is  not  economically  sound  to  have  a  roadway  congestionfree 
throughout  every  hour  of  the  year.  By  designing  the  system  to  satisfy  the  30th  highest  hour 
demand, typical weekday peaks will operate acceptably. 

The  30th  highest  hour  volumes  (30  HV)  for  Florence  were  derived  from  the  manual  turning 
movement  counts  conducted  at  the  study  intersections  in  accordance  with  the  methodology 
described  in  the  ODOT  Analysis  Procedures  Manual  (APM).  The  APM  describes  three  methods  for 
estimating  30  HV  volumes  including  the  OnSite  ATR  method,  the  ATR  Characteristic  Table 
method,  and  the  Seasonal  Trend  Table  method.  Since  there  are  no  ATR's  located  within  the  City 
limits  and  no  ATR's  provided  in  the  characteristic  table  that  can  accurately  represent  the 
conditions in Florence, the Seasonal Trend Table method was selected.

study  intersections  by  the  factors  shown  in  Table  6  in  accordance  with  ODOT's  Analysis 
Procedures Manual (APM) (Reference 8). Figure 47 provides a summary of the seasonally adjusted

the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour.  The  findings  of  the  existing  conditions  analysis  are  also  shown  in 
Figure  47  and  summarized  in  Table  7  below  which  also  shows  the  applicable  mobility  standard. 
As  shown,  all  study  intersections  currently  meet  the  applicable  mobility  and  levelofservice

Multi-Modal Level of Service Analysis

For  the  multimodal  level  of  service  analysis,  the  methodology  from  the  NCHRP  Report  370 
(Reference  9)  was  used  as  a  basis  for  evaluating  multiple  modes  of  travel  on  the  Highway  101 
corridor.  NCHRP  370  provides  a  scientific  basis  for  evaluating  multimodal  level  of  service 
(MMLOS)  on  urban  streets,  combining  LOS  analysis  for  auto,  transit,  bicycle,  and  pedestrian 
travel  modes.  The  methodology  consists  of  a  set  of  recommended  procedures  for  predicting 
traveler  perceptions  of  quality  of  service  and  performance  measures  for  urban  streets.  The  value 
of this analysis tool is that the model results have been calibrated to user perception based on real 
traffic situations. 

As  defined  by  the  methodology,  a  segment  is  made  up  of  the  link  of  roadway  between  two 
signalized  intersections  and  the  downstream  intersection.  Because  only  the  downstream 
intersection is considered for each segment, the methodology is limited to analyzing one direction

of travel at a time. For each link and downstream intersection, the principal inputs into the model 
are listed below: 

·   At the downstream cross street:  

            o     Approach volumes and lane geometries; and, 

            o     Signal timing data 

·   Along the segment being analyzed:  

            o     Geometry: crosssection geometry of the roadway link, pavement condition, speed 
                  limit, presence of a median (and type), turn lanes, number of unsignalized 
                  intersections/driveways, number of trees, pavement condition, and jaywalking 
                  assumptions; 

            o     Volumes: pedestrian volumes, vehicular volumes, heavy vehicle percentages, and 
                  average travel speed; and, 

            o     Transit data: the number of routes, frequency of service, and average passenger 
                  loads (performance measures such as ontime performance percentages are also a 
                  factor in the analysis). 

For  auto  and  transit  modes,  the  methodology  does  not  account  for  an  intersection  analysis.  As 
such,  a  segment  LOS  is  developed  based  on  only  those  link  characteristics  and  geometry 
previously  listed.  For  bicycle  and  pedestrian  modes,  the  methodology  develops  a  segment  LOS 
based on a combined link LOS as well as downstream intersection LOS. Note in this case, because 
the Rhody Express does not travel directly along US 101 for any appreciable distance, transit LOS 
cannot be calculated for the segments analyzed. 

The  resultant  LOS  corresponds  to  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  that  travelers  perceive  of 
traffic control, sidewalk and bike lane widths (if present), buffers between the travel lane and bike 
paths  and  sidewalks  (i.e.  parking  lanes,  planter  strips,  etc.),  and  other  characteristics  found  on  an 
urban  roadway.  Safety  is  indirectly  considered  in  the  MMLOS  analysis  in  that  the  letter  ratings 
are  based  in  large  part  on  user  perceptions  of  comfort  (including  safety)  for  bicyclists  and 
pedestrians.  

The  inputs  into  the  analysis  for  this  study  are  based  on  several  sources  of  data  compiled  for  this 
project, in addition to several assumptions to fill in missing gaps of required inputs. The MMLOS 
analysis  was  applied  to  the  existing  Highway  101  facility  to  develop  a  baseline  for  future  relative 
comparison  between  alternatives  that  will  be  generated  at  a  later  date  as  part  of  this  project.  The 
segments  analyzed  are  defined  by  the  locations  of  signalized  intersections,  as  prescribed  by  the 
methodology.  Table  8  provides  a  segment  MMLOS  summary  of  the  existing  conditions  in  the 
northbound and southbound directions for the weekday p.m. peak hour study period.

As shown in Table 8, a segment analysis for the existing conditions reveals the corridor's levelof
service  from  a  multimodal  perspective.  With  this  analysis,  elements  of  each  mode  (such  as 
roadway  geometry,  signal  timing,  access  spacing,  transit  frequency,  bicycle  demand,  and  others) 
have  an  effect  on  each  other.  For  example,  an  increase  in  rightturnsonred  may  improve  the 
vehicle  LOS  but  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  pedestrians  being  able  to  cross  the  street,  thus 
impacting  the  pedestrian  LOS.  As  such,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  results  of  the  above 
analysis  are  based  on  planning  level  assumptions  with  as  much  field  data  as  was  able  to  be 
incorporated.  The  analysis  serves  as  an  additional  tool  in  identifying  potential  hotspot  locations 
that may be missed by traditional intersection and segment LOS analysis.  

The  existing  conditions  analysis  results  shown  in  Table  8  will  serve  as  a  basis  for  comparison 
when  various  improvement  alternatives  are  considered  in  later  phases  of  this  study.  Each  mode 
will  be  analyzed  in  greater  detail,  focusing  on  achieving  the  greatest  system  benefit  to  align  with 
the goals of the MOA and community.

SAFETY ANALYSIS

This  section  provides  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  historic  roadway  safety  information  in 
Florence.  As  a  starting  point,  both  state  highways  in  Florence  were  reviewed  for  identification  in 
the ODOT Safety Priority Index System. This is followed by an analysis of crash data provided by 
ODOT.  The  crash  data  includes  all  reported  crashes  that  occurred  at  study  intersections  for  the 
fiveyear period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009. 

Statewide Priority Index System

The  Statewide  Priority  Index  System  (SPIS)  is  a  method  developed  by  ODOT  for  identifying 
hazardous  locations  on  state  highways  with  consideration  of  crash  frequency,  crash  rate,  and 
crash  severity.  As  described  in  ODOT's  SPIS  description,  a  roadway  segment  becomes  a  SPIS  site 
if  a  location  has  three  or  more  crashes  or  one  or  more  fatal  crashes  over  the  threeyear  period. 
Under this method, all state highways are analyzed in 0.10 mile segments to determine SPIS sites. 
Statewide,  there  are  approximately  6,000  SPIS  sites.  SPIS  sites  are  typically  intersections,  but  can 
also be roadway segments.

According  to  ODOT's  Project  Safety  Management  System  (Reference  10),  four  SPIS  sites  are  shown 
to be in the "85 ­ 89.99" percentile. 

Intersection Crash Data Analysis

ODOT  provided  detailed  crash  data  covering  all  crashes  that  occurred  in  the  City  of  Florence  for 
the  fiveyear  period  from  January  1,  2005  to  December  31,  2009.  The  data  were  analyzed  to 
determine crash rates for all study intersections and roadway segments.  

Crash  rates  for  intersections  were  calculated  in  crashes  per  million  entering  vehicles  (MEV).  The 
crash data are summarized in Table 9, including types and severity of crashes as well as crash rate 
and critical crash rate for each intersection. 

Based  on a  review  of  the  crash  data, the  existing streets  and  intersections within  Florence  operate 
well within acceptable safety standards. 

Segment Crash Data Analysis

ODOT  provided  crash  data  summary  for  the  four  SPIS  sites  in  the  "85  ­  89.99"  percentile  for  the 
threeyear  period  between  January  1,  2007  and  December  31,  2009.  The  US  101/17th  Street 
intersection is included in two of the sites, US 101 (MP 189.64 to 198.76) and US 101 (MP 189.71 to 
189.81).  Therefore,  crash  history  at  these  two  sites  was  combined  in  the  reported  summary.  The 
crash  data  are  summarized  in  Table  10  including  types  and  severity  of  crashes  as  well  as  crash 
rate and critical crash rate for each segment. 

These  sites  have  crash  rates  in  the  range  of  approximately  0.63  to  0.74  crashes  per  million  vehicle 
miles traveled (MVMT). No obvious crash patterns were identified.

ASSESSMENT OF POLICIES AND PROJECTS IN EXISTING TSP

The  types  of  deficiencies  and  needs  that  are  not  addressed  by  policies  in  the  City's  2002  TSP, 
Community  Transportation  Plan,  and  CIP  by  in  large  are  captured  in  Project  Memorandum  #2, 
Goals,  Policies,  and  Performance  Measures.  This  Memorandum,  developed  by  City  Staff  and  last 
revised September 5, 2010, evaluated existing transportation policies for their relevance to the TSP 
update.  Project  Memorandum  #2  identified  policies  that  are  outdated  and  no  longer  needed, 
policies  that  will  need  to  be  reevaluated  and  potentially  modified  to  be  consistent  with  existing 
conditions  and  new  transportation  findings,  and  policies  that  do  not  yet  exist  and  will  need  to  be 
added.  The  following  is  a  summary  of  previously  identified  policy  actions  that  will  need  to  be 
incorporated in the TSP: 

Update existing policy to reflect current fixed route transit service. 

       ·   Ensure  that  street  standards  are  consistent  between  the  TSP  (policy)  and  the  development 
           code (regulations). 
       ·   Updated street functional classification definitions. 
       ·   Review  and,  if  necessary,  update  existing  policy  to  reflect  the  Americans  with  Disabilities 
           Act. 
       ·   Review  and,  if  necessary,  update  existing  transportation  policies  to  be  consistent  with  the 
           Airport Master Plan. 
       ·   Add policies that: 
               o   Promote  street  connectivity  to  reduce  travel  times,  congestion,  and  reliance  on  US 
                   101. 
               o   Tie required improvements to adopted operational standards. 
               o   Recognize the need for more trails and multiuse paths.

                   o      Recognize the desire to establish Rhododendron Drive as a state scenic route. 
                   o      Support Safe Routes to Schools. 
                   o      Address traffic calming and speed limit enforcement. 
                   o      Address pedestrian safety (safe pedestrian crossings). 
                   o      Address  transit  stops  (pedestrian  access,  facility  design,  expectations  for 
                          accommodation of as part of private development). 
The  transportation  deficiencies  identified  this  memorandum  support  the  changes  to  the  City's 
transportation  policies,  as  outlined  above.  In  addition,  based  on  the  documented  existing 
conditions,  the  following  may  be  appropriate  for  inclusion  in  new  or  modified  transportation 
policies: 

      ·      The  importance  of  reducing  transportation  system  constraints  to  support  economic 
             development. 
      ·      The need for continuous bicycle and pedestrian systems to promote nonmotorized modes 
             of transportation. 
      ·      The need for increased bus service during peak commuting and/or weekend hours. 
Draft  policy  language  that  incorporates  the  actions  identified  here  and  that  implements  the 
preferred local transportation system will be developed as part of a subsequent project task. 

Future Transportation Conditions
The  following  describes  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  traffic  volume  development  and  the

This  section  describes  how  the  Florence  street  system  will  operate  if  traffic  grows  at  projected 
rates and no improvements or expansions are made to the system. 

Traffic Volume Forecast

The  turning  movement  counts  provided  by  ODOT  for  the  existing  conditions  analysis  were  used 
in  conjunction  with  the  base  and  future  model  volumes  provided  by  the  Lane  County  Council  of 
Governments  (LCOG)  to  derive  future  turning  movements  at  the  study  intersections.  Year  2035 
intersection  turning  movement  volumes  were  developed  using  a  methodology  described  in

turning movements from the ODOT traffic counts. The existing link volumes were then evaluated along with the link volumes
shown in the base year 2009 and future year 2035 LCOG traffic model following the methodology described in the National
Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 255. This document describes two types of adjustment methods used to determine
the final link volumes used in the analysis. The two adjustment methods are applied as follows:
      ·      Ratio Method: In the Ratio method the existing volume is divided by the base model volume then multiplied by the
             future model volume to derive an adjusted volume that takes into account the difference between the models and the
             observed count. The results of this method were used when the Difference method resulted in a negative number or when
             the absolute value of the Difference method was greater than the absolute value of the Ratio method.

      ·      Difference Method: In the Difference method the base model volume is subtracted from the existing volume then added
             to the future model volume to derive a future adjusted volume that takes into account the net difference between the

Traffic Operations Analysis Results

The  findings  of  the  future  nobuild  year  2035  conditions  analysis  are  shown  in  Figure  48  and 
summarized in Table 11 below, which also shows the applicable mobility standard. 

                                                     




                                                                                                                                                                              

             models and the observed count. The results of this method were used when the existing volumes were significantly higher
             than the base model volumes resulting in an excessively high value for the Ratio method. 
Based on NCHRP 255, the final model volumes are often the result of an average of the two methods except in those situations
described above: when the Difference is less than zero, when the absolute value of the Difference is greater than the absolute value
of the Ratio, or when the existing link volume is significantly higher than the base model volume. The volumes selected through
this process for the operations analysis were distributed at the study intersections based on the existing distribution. Volumes were
then manually balanced or "smoothed" between intersections.

2 V/C ratios reported for signalized intersection reflect the overall intersection V/C ratio; for unsignalized intersections,  
   the reported V/C ratio is for the critical minorstreet approach. 
3 Recent policy and intent clarifications by ODOT considers calculated vales for V/C ratios within 0.03 of the adopted 

   standard in the OHP to be considered in compliance with the standard. 

As shown in Figure 48 and Table 11, there are five study intersections under ODOT's jurisdiction 
that  are  forecast  to  exceed  the  applicable  OHP  mobility  standard  under  future  nobuild  traffic 
conditions.  The  Kingwood  Street/9th  Street  intersection  is  also  forecast  to  operate  unacceptably 
under  future  nobuild  traffic  conditions.  Improvements  at  these  intersections  as  well  as  those 
potentially  impacted  by  other  future  "build"  improvements  will  need  to  satisfy  the  mobility 
standards  identified  previously.  Alternatively,  the  City  and  ODOT  may  seek  alternative  mobility 
standards  for  these  intersections.  Attachment  "K"  includes  the  future  nobuild  levelofservice  analysis

It  should  be  noted  that  recent  policy  and  intent  clarifications  by  ODOT  regarding  Oregon 
Administrative  Rule  (OAR)  6600120060  (the  "Transportation  Planning  Rule  (TPR)")  considers 
calculated vales for V/C ratios within 0.03 of the adopted standard in the OHP to be considered in 
compliance  with  the  standard.  As  such,  forecast  V/C  ratios  at  ODOT  intersections  can  be 
considered  compliant  with  the  TPR  when  they  are  within  0.03  of  the  adopted  standard  in  the 
OHP.

US 101/Munsel Lake Road

The  US  101/Munsel  Lake  Road  intersection  is  a  threelegged  intersection  with  stop  control  on  the 
minor  street  (Munsel  Lake  Road)  approach.  The  minor  street  approaches  are  currently  one  lane 
only.  The  forecast  heavy  westbound  leftturn  demand  from  Munsel  Lake  Road  experiences  long 
delays  in  entering  the  US  101  traffic  stream,  and  causes  the  critical  westbound  approach  to 
operate over capacity. 

US 101/27th Street

The  US  101/27th  Street  intersection  is  a  fourlegged  intersection  with  stop  control  on  the  minor 
street  (27th  Street)  approaches.  The  minor  street  approaches  are  currently  one  lane  only.  While 
side  street  volumes  are  not  forecast  to  be  very  high,  the  high  northbound  and  southbound 
through  volumes  do  not  provide  for  adequate  gaps  in  traffic  for  vehicles  wishing  to  cross  or  turn 
left onto US 101, causing the eastbound singlelane approach to operate over capacity. 

US 101/15th Street

The  US  101/15th  Street  intersection  is  a  fourlegged  intersection  with  stop  control  on  the  minor 
street  (15th  Street)  approaches.  The  minor  street  approaches  are  currently  one  lane  only.  While 
side  street  volumes  are  not  forecast  to  be  very  high,  the  high  northbound  and  southbound 
through volumes do not provide for adequate gaps in traffic for  vehicles wishing to turn onto US 
101, causing the eastbound singlelane approach to operate over capacity. 

OR 126/Quince Street

The OR 126/Quince Street intersection is a fourlegged intersection with stop control on the minor 
street (Quince Street) approaches. The minor street approaches are currently one lane only. Heavy 
demand is forecast for the northbound approach on Quince, and the volume of through traffic on 
OR 126 does not provide for adequate gaps in traffic for vehicles wishing to cross or turn left onto 
OR 126, causing the northbound shared leftthrough lane to operate over capacity.   

OR 126/Spruce Street

The OR 126/Spruce Street intersection is a fourlegged intersection with stop control on the minor 
street (Spruce Street) approaches. The minor street approaches are currently one lane only. Heavy 
demand is forecast for the southbound approach on Spruce, and the volume of through traffic on 
OR  126  does  not  provide  for  adequate  gaps  in  traffic  for  vehicles  wishing  to  turn  onto  OR  126, 
causing the southbound singlelane approach to operate over capacity. 

Kingwood Street/9th Street

The  Kingwood  Street/9th  Street  intersection  is  a  fourlegged  intersection  with  stop  control  on  the 
Kingwood  Street  approaches  (northbound  and  southbound).  Heavy  through  and  leftturn 
volumes  on  9th  Street  do  not  provide  for  adequate  gaps  in  traffic  for  vehicles  withing  to  cross  or 
turn  left  onto  Kingwood  Street,  causing  the  northbound  and  southbound  stopcontrolled 
approaches to operate at LOS F.

SUMMARY

Existing Transportation Conditions

The  existing  street  system  currently  operates  well  within  acceptable  standards  for  vehicular 
movements  within  and  through  the  City.  There  are  elements  of  the  system  that  will  be  further 
evaluated, including: 

    ·    Extended  collector  and  local  street  connectivity  into  new  developing  areas,  and  those 
         areas currently lacking good connections; 
    ·    Safe and better connected circulation for pedestrian and bicycle modes; 
    ·    Improved/enhanced transit service, within Florence and to outside destinations; 
    ·    Speeding issues; and, 
    ·    Parking on local and collector streets, and minimizing conflicts with bicycle lanes. 

Future Transportation Conditions

Five  of  the  twelve  study  intersections  under  ODOT's  jurisdiction  are  forecast  to  exceed  the 
applicable OHP mobility standard under future traffic conditions, including: 

             o    US 101/Munsel Lake Road (unsignalized) 
             o    US 101/27th Street (unsignalized) 
             o    US 101/15th Street (unsignalized) 
             o    OR 126/Quince Street (unsignalized) 
             o    OR 126/Spruce Street (unsignalized) 
One local intersection is forecast to exceed operational standards under future traffic conditions: 

             o    Kingwood Street/9th Street (unsignalized) 
 
All of these intersections are twoway stopcontrolled intersections and operate over capacity due 
to an inability of minor street motorists find acceptable "gaps" in major street traffic attempting to 
cross  or  turn  left  onto  the  highway/major  local  street.  This  is  exacerbated  by  the  fact  that  in  all 
cases,  the  minor  street  approaches  are  single  lane  approaches.  The  transportation  analysis  to  be 
conducted  in  subsequent  tasks  will  evaluate  alternative  solutions  to  these  deficiencies.  For  these 
unsignalized intersections, this analysis will assess the following: 

    ·    magnitude of the problem (i.e. how many minor street vehicles are expected to experience 
         these long delays?); 
    ·    opportunity  for  alternative  access  to  the  highway  (i.e.  is  there  a  traffic  signal  reasonably 
         nearby that could facilitate protected access to the highway?); 
    ·    geometric/lane configuration modifications to resolve the operational deficiency;

    ·    system impact of providing a "robust" solution (i.e. if a traffic signal were installed in this 
         location  to  provide  protected  access  for  the  minor  street,  would  it  be  adequately  spaced 
         from up and downstream signals?); and, 
    ·    potential for alternate solutions to a traffic signal. 

The  future  alternatives  analysis  will  evaluate  the  operations,  safety  and  connectivity  of  all  travel 
modes to accommodate increased population and employment levels in Florence.

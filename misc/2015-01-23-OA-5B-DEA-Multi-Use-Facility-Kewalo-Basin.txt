Summary (Provide proposed action and purpose/need in less than 200 words. Please keep the
summary brief and on this one page):

The proposed project is a multi-use facility encompassing approximately 2.1 acres within Kewalo Basin and located
between Kewalo Basin Harbor and Ala Moana Beach Park in what is now a surface parking lot. The facility consists of
four, two-level buildings with the majority on the second level equipped with an open deck and viewing. Combined, the
four buildings include approximately 45,000 square feet of waterfront retail stores. The multi-use facility consists of four
buildings and a parking structure. The buildings are two levels most with open decks viewing spaces on the second level.
Buildings will be no more than 45 feet near the waterfront, as stipulated in the HCDA Makai Area Plan.

The proposed action will fully comply with programs designed for the protection and stewardship of Hawai‘i’s
environmental resources and is intended to re-establish the Kewalo Basin area as a viable commercial area. The proposed
action will facilitate the current and future uses of Kewalo Basin for commercial operations. As a part of the Kaka‘ako
Community Development District Makai Area Plan, the proposed action is intended to create a vibrant pedestrian-oriented
urban community. The multi-use facility will house various waterfront retail stores and small restaurants.

Executive Summary

This Environmental Assessment (EA) was conducted to assess potential environmental impacts
associated with the construction and operation of a proposed multi-use facility at Kewalo Basin,
Hawai‘i on the island of O‘ahu. The EA was prepared to identify, document and address
potential environmental impacts associated with the Proposed Action. The EA examines two (2)
alternatives, a No Action Alternative, and a Proposed Action Alternative defined as follows:
   •   Alternative I – No Action Alternative
   •   Alternative II – The Proposed Action – Construction of a multi-use facility: This project
       would provide community developments including commercial spaces and restaurants to
       both O‘ahu locals and visitors. This development aims to revive Kewalo Basin as a
       commercial area.
The following potentially impacted environments were evaluated in this EA.
   •   Topography and Geology
   •   Soils
   •   Natural Hazard
   •   Flora and Fauna
   •   Wetlands
   •   Water Resources
   •   Climate and Air Quality
   •   Noise
   •   Solid Wastes
   •   Land Use Considerations and Zoning
   •   Archaeological and Cultural Considerations
   •   Circulation and Traffic
   •   Social Factors and Community Identity
   •   Economic Considerations
   •   Recreational and Public Facilities
   •   Visual and Aesthetic Resources
   •   Infrastructure Systems and Utilities

Findings

   •   A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is anticipated based on the environmental
       and societal factors considered under Alternative I and Alternative II.
   •   While potential impacts to Soil, Air Quality, Noise and Circulation and Traffic are
       possible during construction, implementing best management practices would reduce
       these impacts to less than significant levels. Further impacts are anticipated during
       operation of the Proposed Action. These impacts can be minimized by best management
       practices, upgrades to infrastructure, and adherence to applicable regulations.
   •   Beneficial impacts to Land Use Considerations and Zoning are anticipated assuming
       implementation of Alternative II would address the commercial needs of the
       Kaka‘ako/Ala Moana neighborhood area and provide jobs to the island of O‘ahu.
   •   Under Alternative I, the No Action Alternative, Land Use Considerations and Zoning
       would incur a negative impact as full use of the land will not be realized. Additional


                                               ES-1
negative impacts are anticipated to Social Factors and Community Identity under
Alternative I.

SECTION 1 I N T R O D U C T I O N A N D S U M M A R Y
    1.1 Scope and Authority
This Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) has been prepared pursuant to Chapter 343, Hawai‘i Revised
Statutes (HRS) and associated Title 11, Chapter 200 Hawai‘i Administrative Rules (HAR). Section 343-5,
HRS, establishes nine “triggers” that require environmental review under the statute. The specific trigger
for environmental review of the proposed project is the use of State lands. The project area is owned by
the State of Hawai‘i. The project area is located within the Special Management Area (SMA), which is
regulated by the State of Hawai‘i, Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism
(DBEDT), Office of Planning (OP). This EA will also fulfill future SMA Use Permit application
requirements of compliance with HRS Chapter 343.
State of Hawaii, Declaratory Ruling Nos. 80-01 and 84-01 state the entire Kaka‘ako Development District
Plan to be evaluated as a “group of proposed or possible actions” taken as a comprehensive whole. As
projects are proposed for development, separate supplemental assessments are required for evaluation.
The intent of the document is to ensure that systematic consideration is given to the environmental
consequences of the Proposed Action. The Proposed Action is the construction of a new multi-use facility
at Kewalo Basin, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i (Figures 1 and 2).

    1.3 Kakaako Makai Area Background
This section provides a background of the Makai Area, as excerpted from the 2005 Kakaako Makai Area
Plan Amendment Final EA. The Kakaako Community Development District was established in 1976.
This area is divided into two areas; Mauka and Makai:
    •  Mauka Area: The land between Punchbowl Street, King Street, Piikoi Street, and Ala Moana
       Boulevard.
   • Makai Area: The land makai of Ala Moana Boulevard between Kewalo Basin and Pier 4, totaling
       133 acres.
Over the years, many amendments to the Kakaako Makai Area Plan were made. In the 1985 revision,
concerns unique to the Makai Area were addressed. These concerns included:
    •    Harbor use at the Fort Armstrong area;
    •    Central residential area;
    •    Preservation of scenic views;
    •    A proposed waterfront park at the kakaako peninsula; and
    •    Potential use of the Makai Area as a relocation area for displaced Kakaako Makai Area
         businesses.
The boundaries of the Makai Area were revised in 1987, then again in 1990. Land makai of Ala Moana
Boulevard from Ala Moana Park to the Aloha Tower were now included. However, lands between Piers 4
and 8 were reassigned to the Aloha Tower Development Corporation. Property occupied by Hawaiian
Electric Company makai of Nimitz Highway were excluded from those lands. The Makai Area expanded
the area from 133 acres to 221 acres.
With the revised area, a 1990 revision to the Makai Area Plan was made. These revisions included:
    • Removal of residential and industrial uses from the Makai Area;
    • Relocation of existing uses to Sand Island, Kapalama, and Honolulu Harbors;
    • Revision of roadways;
    • Expansion of Ala Moana Park into Kewalo Basin;
    • Creation of an inland waterway system;
    • Provision for cultural and educational facilities within the waterfront park; and
    • Passenger cruise ship terminals at Piers 1 and 2.
Feasibility studies were conducted in the early 1990s by HCDA on ideas proposed by the 1990 Makai
Area Plan. A reevaluation of land use patterns and concepts followed, and the 1994 Proposed Makai Area
Plan and Supplemental EIS were produced. This culminated in the Final Supplemental EIS which was
accepted in October 1994, though the revisions to the Makai Area Plan were never adopted by HCDA.
 A 1998 revision to the Makai Area Plan was made “because of a desire to balance public costs with
revenues from private development, create a livelier urban environment, and improve vehicular and
pedestrian flow through the area.” Other revisions include, elimination of the proposed residential
component from the 1994 plan, redesignation of the Commercial Zone to include a wide-range of
commercial land uses such as office and retail, the addition of a Mixed-Use Zone-Industrial designation to
support maritime activities, and reduction of the maximum building height from 300 to 200 feet. The
1998 Makai Area Plan was adopted by HCDA in August 1998.



                                                   1-2
The Waterfront Business Plan was adopted in October 2002. The Plan established a vision, mission, and
strategy for future development of the Makai Area, and recognized the importance of residential use in a
work-live-shop-play community.
The 2005 Kakaako Makai Area Plan Amendment Final EA addressed the need for residential use in the
Makai Area. A Mixed-Use zone was proposed to include residential, commercial, and public use.
Additionally, residential use would be allowed in the Waterfront Commercial zone. This EA will include
the evaluation of the larger Makai Area in consideration of the Proposed Action.
    1.4 Future Development
The Makai Area is currently undergoing many changes and development, with more planned for the
future. Projects planned for the area include:
Bellavita: The site of the current a charter boat building located between Kewalo Basin Harbor and Ala
Moana Blvd will be renovated and/or redeveloped to accommodate the needs of the proposed restaurant’s
operations, including the installation of a wood fired oven. The renovations may also include some site
work for the construction of the outdoor seating patio. The proposed project will encompass
approximately 6,000 square feet within Kewalo Basin and will be occupied by an Italian Restaurant,
Napule.
Kupu Green Job Training Center: First-of-its-kind facility for creating leadership in the growing green
jobs sector. The new facility will provide youth with the opportunity to learn skills for a more sustainable
future and to build partnerships that can serve as a global model of responsible stewardship and a thriving
community.
Kewalo Basin Improvements: Replacement of piers and utilities of the small boat harbor. Other
improvements may include security upgrades and dock renovations, to benefit the charter boat businesses,
fishermen and other harbor users, upgrading restrooms, adding food service and a convenience store for
boaters.
Seagull Schools: Kaka'ako First School project will provide for a new 15,380 square foot center for up to
270 children on a 3/4 acre parcel of land adjacent to the Kaka'ako Park. The three building center consists
of 11 classrooms, a commercial kitchen, administrative space, two playground areas, and a kupuna
training/gathering room.
Historic Pump Station: Restoration of the historic structure and inclusion of plan for community use.
Kamehameha Schools Redevelopment: Kamehameha Schools lands west of the Kewalo Harbor are being
redeveloped with low-rise residential and a few commercial units. There will be a pedestrian pathway to
access the City & County of Honolulu rail station.
Howard Hughes Corporation: Currently constructing luxury high-rise condominiums mauka of Ala
Moana Boulevard, with development rights for a total of 22 condos in its Ward Villages master plan.

SECTION 2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    2.1 Purpose and Need
Purpose: This EA has been prepared to satisfy the requirements of HRS Chapter 343. The purpose of the
Proposed Action (i.e., the proposed addition) is to re-establish the Kewalo Basin area as a viable
commercial area.
Need:	   The proposed action will facilitate the current and future uses of Kewalo Basin for commercial
operations. As a part of the Kaka‘ako Community Development District Makai Area Plan, the proposed
action is intended to create a vibrant pedestrian-oriented urban community. The multi-use facility will
house various waterfront retail stores and small restaurants.
    2.2 Project Description
The proposed project is a multi-use facility encompassing approximately 2.1 acres within Kewalo Basin
and located between Kewalo Basin Harbor and Ala Moana Beach Park in what is now a surface parking
lot. The facility consists of four, two-level buildings with the majority on the second level equipped with
an open deck and viewing spaces (Figures 3 through 7). Combined, the four buildings include
approximately 45,000 square feet of waterfront retail stores. The multi-use facility consists of four
buildings and a parking structure. The buildings are two levels most with open decks viewing spaces on
the second level. Buildings will be no more than 45 feet near the waterfront, as stipulated in the HCDA
Makai Area Plan.
    •     Building 1, located adjacent to Ala Moana Boulevard, will offer commercial uses including
          waterfront retail consisting of various retail stores and small restaurants.
    •     Moving southwest, Building 2, similarly to Building 1, will offer commercial uses including
          waterfront retail consisting of various retail stores and small restaurants.
    •     Building 3 will offer commercial uses including a live entertainment venue and a restaurant and
          bar on the ground floor, and office space and open decks on the 2nd floor.
    •     Building 4 is separated from the other buildings by a 24-foot wide drive aisle and is located east
          of Building 3. Building 4 will offer commercial uses which include a café on the ground floor
          and a multipurpose hall on the 2nd level.
    •     A 250-stall garage is a two level structure and will be located between Buildings 1 and 3, adjacent
          to Building 2.
    2.3     Construction Time Frame and Estimated Project Construction Costs

SECTION 3 A L T E R N A T I V E S                INCLUDING                THE         PROPOSED
ACTION
This section details the alternatives that were analyzed in the Draft EA. Under HAR, Title 11, Department
of Health, Chapter 200 Environmental Impact Statement Rules, Section 11-200-17(f), all alternatives
considered for the proposed project should be evaluated. These alternatives may possibly enhance
environmental quality or avoid, reduce, or minimize some or all of the adverse environmental effects,
costs, and risks.
    3.1 Alternative I: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action alternative, the Site would be kept as is with no changes or alterations. This
alternative would not accomplish the goals detailed in Section 2.1, Purpose and Need and would leave
much of the existing Site vacant.
    3.2 Alternative II: The Proposed Action
Encompassing approximately 2.1 acres within Kewalo Basin and located between Kewalo Basin Harbor
and Ala Moana Beach Park, the proposed project is a multi-use facility. It will consist of four, two-level
buildings with the majority on the second level equipped with an open deck and viewing spaces.
Combined, the four buildings include approximately 45,000 square feet of waterfront retail stores; small
restaurants, cafes and bars; commercial office space; a live entertainment venue; and a large observation
deck and signature multipurpose venue on the second floor. Additionally, the proposed project includes a
250-stall, multi-level parking structure.

SECTION 4 A F F E C T E D E N V I R O N M E N T
This section discusses the current status of the potentially affected environments should the Proposed
Action be implemented. Affected environments inclFude important natural and cultural sources and
systems. Environmental consequences are provided in Section 5.
    4.1 Physical Environment
4.1.1 Topography and Geology
According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Honolulu, Hawai‘i, 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle
map, the Kewalo Basin Harbor elevation is approximately 0 feet above mean sea level (USGS, 1989).
The Site is primarily flat and is mostly paved or constructed upon. The area of the proposed construction
currently is a paved asphalt parking lot.
The 2005 Makai Area Final EA noted the Makai area is underlain by a coral layer approximately 5 to 20
feet below mean sea level.
4.1.2 Soils
The Web Soil Survey (U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 2012) presents detailed information
regarding soil types present on the Island of O‘ahu. The dominant soil type in the project area is listed as
100% Fill Land, material dredged from the ocean or hauled from other sources. Existing vegetation is
sparse and only in designated planter box or lawn areas.
4.1.3 Natural Hazard
Flood hazard areas are delineated by Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) prepared by the Federal
Emergency Response Agency (FEMA), National Flood Insurance Program. Firm Panel 15003C0362G
depicts flood hazard for the Site (Figure 8). The project area is categorized as Zone AE and defined as an
area where flood hazards are determined.
A tsunami is a series of great waves, typically the result of a violent displacement of the seafloor.
Tsunamis are characterized by high speed (up to 560 miles per hour (mph), long wave lengths (up to 120
miles), and long periods between successive wave crests (up to several hours). Tsunamis have the
potential to inundate the coastline, causing severe property damage and/or loss of life. The Tsunami
Inundation Zone Map 17 indicates the tsunami hazard for the area (Figure 9). The project area is
designated as Tsunami Inundation Zones (City and County of Honolulu, 2010). Draft Extreme Tsunami
Evacuation Maps were produced by the City and County of Honolulu and proposed in 2014. The area is
located on Map 19, Inset 2, and is still designated as a tsunami hazard zone.
4.1.4 Flora and Fauna
There is moderate landscaping on Site consisting mainly of trees and grasses. As noted in the Kewalo
Basin Repairs Project, Draft Environmental Impact Statement (October 2010), a few native species were
observed in the park landscaping. These included the hala, loulu palm, and areca palm.
Dogs, cats, rodents, and mongoose have been documented in the Kaka‘ako area. Birds commonly
observed in the area include common mynahs, common pigeons, zebra dove, spotted dove, sparrows, and
finches. University of Hawai‘i, Center for Conservation Research and Training records were reviewed by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) resulted in no record of threatened or endangered species at
the Site.
4.1.5 Wetlands
The USFWS National Wetland Inventory (USFWS, 2014) did not identify any wetlands in the project
area. However, the harbor area is approximately 20 feet from the project area. It is classified as a 32.97-
acre estuarine and marine deepwater wetland.

4.1.6 Water Resources
Groundwater
The Site is defined by aquifer code: 30101116 (23321). The Site is situated in the Palolo aquifer system
which is comprised of a sedimentary caprock aquifer. The upper, sedimentary caprock aquifer is an
unconfined, sedimentary, basal aquifer. It has moderate salinity (1000-5000 milligrams per liter [mg/L]
chloride [Cl-]), and is categorized as a non-drinking water source that is also not ecologically important. It
is replaceable, and highly vulnerable to contamination (Mink and Lau, 1990). The majority of the aquifer
system is makai, or down-gradient, of the Hawai‘i State Underground Injection Control Line (UIC).
Typically, aquifers that are down-gradient of the UIC line are considered non-potable, and aquifers up-
gradient of the UIC line are considered potential drinking water sources. Since the Site is located down-
gradient of the UIC line, the water below the Site is characterized as non-potable.
Surface Water
There are no streams or surface water features at the Site. The nearest surface water bodies are the Pacific
Ocean to the west and Kewalo Harbor to the north.
4.1.7 Climate and Air Quality
The climate found in Kewalo Basin is characterized by mild and constant temperatures, moderate
humidity, and the persistence of the northeasterly trade winds. Daily maximum temperatures range from
low to high 80s. Daily minimum temperatures range from mid-60s to low 70s. The average annual
rainfall is approximately 20 to 25 inches per year. The majority of the total annual rainfall occurs between
October and March, with the wettest months occurring in November through January.
Air quality at the Site is considered to be good and meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) and State Ambient Air Quality Standards (SAAQS). Air quality in the vicinity is most likely
affected by emission from industrial activities, commercial vessels, and motor vehicle traffic on local
roadways.
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health (HDOH) maintains air monitoring locations throughout the state.
There are two monitoring locations near the Site. The Honolulu air quality monitoring station is located
on the roof of the DOH building (Kinau Hale) in downtown Honolulu’s business district, approximately
1.5 miles north of the Site. Parameters monitored at this location are carbon monoxide (CO), particulate
matter at 10 microns or less (PM10), particulate matter at 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Measurements reported in the 2011 Annual Summary Hawai‘i Air
Quality Data (HDOH, 2011) and applicable NAAQS and SAAQS are found in the following table, Table
1.

4.1.8 Noise
Noise impacts from construction-related activities are regulated under the HAR, HDOH, Title 11, Chapter
46, Community Noise Control. The project area is zoned urban; and as such falls into District Class B
under the HDOH regulations, with a maximum day (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and night (10:00 p.m. to
7:00 a.m.) sound level threshold of 60 A-weighted decibels (dBA). District Class B covers areas zoned as
multi-family dwellings, apartment, business, commercial, hotel, or resort type facilities.

Construction activities will exceed the HDOH sound level thresholds noted. Table 2 lists sound exposure
levels (SELs) associated with typical equipment, in varying operating modes. A construction noise
permit will be required during construction activities.

Once operations of the multi-use commence, noise at the Site will increase via contributions through
operation of the restaurant, live music, and other entertainment type activities. Those establishments with
a liquor license will be held to the Hawaii Liquor Commission laws. Hawaii Liquor Commission laws
are similar to HDOH regulations. The project area falls into Zoning district B under the Hawaii Liquor
Commission rules, with a maximum day (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and night (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.)

                                                    4-8
sound level threshold of 60 C-weighted decibels (dBC). Zoning district B covers areas zoned as multi-
family dwellings, apartment, business, commercial, hotel, or resort type facilities. According to the
National Restaurant Association, the average noise levels found at restaurants is around 70 decibels.
Inclusion of the entertainment venue would increase noise levels during performance times to above 70
decibels. Typical concert levels can exceed 100 decibels. Noise levels at the live music venue are
expected to be much lower than concert levels as the scale of the event is much smaller. These noise
levels may be obscured by traffic noise on Ala Moana Boulevard or adjacent maritime activities (i.e., boat
engines in the harbor).
4.1.9 Solid Waste
Solid waste on the island of O‘ahu is incinerated at the H-POWER waste-to-energy facility located in
Campbell Industrial Park. According to the City and County of Honolulu, Department of Environmental
Services website, Opala.org, O‘ahu recycling rates are above the national average and Honolulu ranks
among the top cities in the country in landfill diversion. The H-POWER facility reduces the volume of
waste entering the landfill by 90%. The remaining ash is deposited at the Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary
Landfill. Construction and demolition wastes are handled separately and are disposed of at the PVT
Landfill.
    4.2 Social Environment
4.2.1 Land Use Considerations and Zoning
According to the State Land Use Commission district classifications, the project site is zoned urban.

4.2.2 Archaeological and Cultural Considerations
The following information was taken from the Kewalo Basin Repairs Project Draft EIS October 2010
document.
        Over the last century, the Kaka‘ako area has been heavily modified by filling of the area for land
        reclamation. The act of adding fill to the area has also contributed to preserving the pattern of
        early Hawaiian life and the remains of nineteenth century Honolulu. Hawaiians used the lowland
        marshes, wetlands, salt pans, and coral reef flats of the area for salt-making and farming of
        fishponds. Land Commission Award documents reveal that much of Kaka‘ako lands were used to
        produce salt. Kaka‘ako has also served as a location for undesirable land uses such as a
        quarantine camp and cemetery for victims of the 1853 smallpox epidemic; hospital for victims of
        the 1895 cholera epidemic; quarantine camp for patients of 1899 bubonic plague; animal
        quarantine; and garbage incinerator.
        Kewalo Basin was later home to the commercial fishing industry, though this declined after
        World War II. Currently Kewalo Basin houses four items that may be considered cultural
        resources:
            •   a statue at the harbor entrance enshrining the pueo (owl) as the protector of the Kaka‘ako
                area;
            •   an honorific statue of the Blessed Mother Marianne Cope for her historic efforts in
                battling Hansen’s disease;
            •   a Native Hawaiian garden associated with the Hālau Kū Māna public charter school (that
                leases space in the net shed next to Kewalo Basin Park);
            •   and the net shed, a structure originally designed for the repair of the fishermen’s nets.
In 2014, an archaeological literature review and field inspection (LR/FI) and a Cultural Impact
Assessment (CIA) were conducted for the project by Cultural Surveys Hawai‘i, Inc. (2014a and 2014b,

                                                    4-9
respectively). These reports included historical research and interviews with community members to
construct a history of land use and determine if cultural and archaeological sites have been recorded in or
near the area. The findings of the studies are summarized in this section; the full reports are included as
Appendix A (LR/FI) and B (CIA).
LR/FI
A detailed historical, cultural, and archaeological background research and field inspection of the Site was
performed to determine the likelihood of historic properties being affected by the proposed project. The
LR/FI did not identify any property of cultural significance during the investigation. As such, an
archaeological inventory survey will likely not be required by the State Historic Preservation Division
(SHPD), nor were any mitigative requirements presented. The SHPD is being consulted. If any
archaeological
CIA
Though the area is primarily fill land, there is much history noted for the area (as mentioned above).
Research and interviews with Hawaiian community members knowledgeable of the project area and
vicinity did reveal concerns regarding potential adverse impacts on cultural, historic, or natural resources,
or practices and beliefs from the proposed multi-use facility project. These concerns, taken from the 2014
CIA, include the following:
    •   Ala Moana Beach Park is designated as a historic property (SIHP # 50-80-14-1388). Concerns
        about historic integrity were raised and suggestions that the design and construction of the project
        area “should emphasize computability with the historic setting and views” and referenced the
        Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Rehabilitation of Historic Properties to provide a
        framework and guidelines for new construction within a historic district.
    •   Historic Hawai‘i Foundation recommended the surf break, Kewalos, be designated as a
        Traditional Cultural Property, which may be eligible to be listed on the Hawai‘i Register of
        Historic Places. Contributing features could be accessed via land and sea, which should be
        integrated into development plans.
    •   Consultation with State of Hawai‘i recognized descendants after the CIA is completed and prior
        to an archaeological inventory survey plan being developed.
4.2.3 Circulation and Traffic
Access to the site would mainly be from Ward Avenue/Ilalo Street and Ala Moana Boulevard. Ala Moana
Boulevard fronts the Kewalo Basin property to the north, with Ward Avenue /Ilalo Streetintersecting Ala
Moana Boulevard from the north. There are three entrances to the Kewalo Basin area. All are along Ala
Moana Boulevard. Figure 10 depicts the vehicular traffic circulation and Figure 11 depicts the pedestrian
circulation. The area surrounding the Site is densely populated, and traffic is usually moderate to heavy.
A transportation impact analysis report (TIAR) was conducted in 2014 for the proposed project (Fehr &
Peers, 2014) and is provided in Appendix C. Traffic operations of seven (7) key intersections were
evaluated with level of service calculations during the weekday evening (PM) and Saturday mid-day (Sat)
peak periods for Existing, Existing plus Project, Cumulative Year 2017, and Cumulative Year 2017 plus
Project conditions. The scenarios are as follows:
    •   Scenario 1: Existing Conditions: Existing volumes observed during the TIAR.
    •   Scenario 2: Existing Plus Project Conditions: Scenario 1 plus traffic estimated and anticipated
        from project build-out and full occupancy.

    •   Scenario 3: Cumulative Year 2017 Conditions: Scenario 1 increase by an annual growth factor
        plus additional anticipated traffic from related projects in the study area expected to be
        constructed and occupied by the Cumulative Year 2017.
    •   Scenario 4: Cumulative Year 2017 Plus Project Conditions: Scenario 3 plus traffic estimated and
        anticipated from project build-out and full occupancy.
Due to the proposed mixed land use and information from prior traffic studies (see the 2010 study
summary below), the TIAR focused on time periods that would be most impacted by the proposed
development. The TIAR findings project an increase in delays at the seven study intersections; however
no significant traffic impacts were identified at any of the study intersections. Generally, the proposed
project is not expected to substantially increase the walking, biking, or transit demand to a level where it
could not be accommodated by existing or planned facilities. The installation of bicycle racks is
recommended to provide secure bicycle storage within sight of employees and customers.
A traffic study was performed for the area as part of the Kewalo Basin Repairs Project Draft EIS October
2010 document. The following information is excerpted from that document.
        Existing traffic conditions, as observed in the 2010 supporting study to the Kewalo Basin Repairs
        Project Draft EIS document, for the Ala Moana Boulevard and Ward Avenue/Ilalo Street
        intersection were found to be at acceptable levels of service for urban areas (Level of Service
        [LOS] D or better) during peak morning and afternoon hours.
        Existing traffic conditions, as observed in 2010, for the Ala Moana Boulevard and Kewalo Basin
        Access intersection were found to be at good levels of service for urban areas (LOS ) during peak
        morning and afternoon hours.
        Traffic conditions projected into 2012, maintained the same LOS for both intersections.
Public transportation in Hawai‘i is provided by the City and County of Honolulu, Department of
Transportation Services. O‘ahu Transit Services (operator of TheBus) is contracted by the Department of
Transportation Services to provide fixed route bus service. There are numerous bus stops in the area
(within ½ mile) that service 23 fixed-route bus lines. Bus routes for the area include:
        • Route 3                        • Route 6                        • Route 8
        • Route 9                        • Route 13                       • Route 17
        • Route 18                       • Route 19                       • Route 20
        • Route 23                       • Route 40                       • Route 42
        • Route 52                       • Route 53                       • Route 55
        • Route 56                       • Route 57, 57A                  • Route 62
        • Route 65                       • Route 88A                      • Route A
        • Route C
The O‘ahu Bike Plan calls for bikeways to be added to most of the major streets in the Kaka’ako area.
Multiple bicycle paths are proposed for the Kewalo area. Of these include a connection between the
existing mauka and makai bike paths in Ala Moana Beach Park, as well as an extension to Kewalo Basin.
Other projects include:
    •   Auahi Street between Ala Moana Boulevard and South Street (Route)
    •   Ward Avenue between Ala Moana Boulevard and Prospect Street (Route)
    •   Halekauwila Street between Ala Moana Boulevard and Ward Avenue (Route)
    •   Kamakee Street between Ala Moana Boulevard and McKinley High School (Lane)
    •   Ala Moana Boulevard between Kalakaua Avenue and Fort Street Mall (Lane)

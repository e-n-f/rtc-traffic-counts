I. INTRODUCTION
This privately-initiated comprehensive plan amendment if approved, would revise the Sarasota
County Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Map and Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan.
The proposed amendment to the Future Land Use Map would change the designation of 68 ±
acres located west of McIntosh Road and south of the Meridian Business Center from Major
Employment Center (MEC) to Moderate Density Residential (gross densities equal to or greater
than two dwelling units per acre and less than five dwelling units per acre). The proposed
amendment to the Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan, Figures 6-9 and 6-10 would change the
designation of Sawyer Loop Road West from Clark Road to McIntosh Road from a two-lane
collector road to a local road.

This amendment is being submitted to permit Taylor Morrison of Florida, Inc. to develop Palmer
Ranch Parcels A-2 and A-6 within the Palmer Ranch Development of Regional Impact (DRI),
located west of McIntosh Road and south of the Meridian Business Center, with a 180 single
family residential community. This Comprehensive Plan Amendment is being processed along
with the following applications:

       ·       An application for Notice of Proposed Change ("NOPC") to update the Palmer Ranch
               Development of Regional Impact ("DRI") Master Development Order (Resolution No. 91-
               170, as amended) to reflect the land use change for Parcels A2 and A6 and the removal
               of the segment of Sawyer Loop Road between Clark Road and McIntosh Road;
       ·       An application for Notice of Proposed Change ("NOPC") to Increment IV of the Palmer
               Ranch DRI to allow the development of 180 residential units on Parcels A-2 and A6
               instead of the current approved office, light industrial and warehousing uses;
       ·       Rezone application to change the zoning on 68.39± acres on Parcels A2 and A6 from
               PCD/ILW (Planned Commerce Development/ Industrial, Light Warehouse) and PCD/OPI
               (Planned Commerce Development/ Office, Professional & Institutional) to RSF-2/PUD
               (Residential Single-Family/Planned Unit Development, 3.5 dwelling units/ Acre); and
       ·       Rezone application to modify the Planned Commerce District (PCD/ILW and PCD/OPI)
               zoning to remove the 68.39± acres designated as Parcels A2 and A6 from the PCD-zoned
               Palmer Park of Commerce, as they are rezoned to RSF-2/PUD.

       ·       Plat vacation petition to vacate: 1) the unimproved Sawyer Loop Road West public road
               right-of-way (Tract 203"); 2) a 12'-wide public drainage, pedestrian easement adjacent
               to unimproved Sawyer Loop Road West to the north; a 3) a 10'-wide public drainage
               and utility easement adjacent to unimproved Sawyer Loop Road West to the south; and
               4) a 100'-wide drainage, utility and buffer easement along the western boundary of
               Parcel A-2.

A neighborhood workshop was held on November 18, 2013, at the Covenant Life Presbyterian
Church, on McIntosh Road, within Palmer Ranch, Sarasota, FL for this amendment. (See Exhibit
B.)

II. REQUESTED AMENDMENT

Amend the Future Land Use Map to redesignate 68.39 ± acres within Palmer Ranch (known as
"Parcels A2 and A6") located south of Clark Road and west of McIntosh Road) from Major
Employment Center to Moderate Density Residential and revising the ''Year 2025 Future
Thoroughfare Plan" by redesignating the segment of Sawyer Loop Road between Clark Road
and McIntosh Road from a 2-lane Minor Collector to a Local Road. Revisions to the

Note: The above listed amendments are consistent with the Florida Community Planning Act,
state and regional plans, and consistent with the goals, objectives, policies, and guiding
principles of the Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan.

III. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF THE CLARK ROAD INDUSTRIAL AREA

In the early 1900's the West Indies Railroad and Steamship Company (later Seaboard Coast Line
Railway) laid railroad tracks in Sarasota County to serve the agricultural and commercial centers
of Fruitville, Bee Ridge, and Venice. Following the end of WWII, the railroads supported the
booming construction industry in Sarasota caused by the rapid population growth. In the late
1940's, lumber and masonry industries began developing in the Ashton Road and Clark Road
area along the railroad tracks. Although railroads continue to play an important role in moving
goods and services cross country, the interstate highway system is relied upon to move goods
and services to and from markets.

Land Use Planning

1975 Future Land Use Plan

In 1975, Sarasota County adopted its first Future Land Use Plan. The 1975 Future Land Use Map
designated a conceptual area in and around Clark Road and McIntosh Road as appropriate
for industrial uses recognizing the existing and potential for future industrial uses.

1981 "Apoxsee," The Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan

In 1981, the "Apoxsee" Future Land Use Plan and Map designated industrial areas which
primarily reflected existing industrial zoning and development as well as large tracts in the urban
fringe and rural areas which were not proximate to existing or planned residential areas. An
approximate 680-acre industrial area was conceptually designated along Clark Road in the
McIntosh Road area. The Future Land Use Plan relied upon small area plans to determine the
actual boundaries of the industrial area and to provide additional guidance in implementing
the comprehensive plan. Following the approval of the Palmer Ranch Development of Regional
Impact in 1984 (Resolution No. 84-418), Palmer Ranch filed a private sector Comprehensive Plan
Amendment (No. 17) to define the boundaries of the Clark Road Industrial area. Adopted in
1987, Comprehensive Plan Amendment No. 17, the Clark Road Industrial Area included existing
industrial development and an additional 262.5± acres of vacant land south of Clark Road
(Palmer Park of Commerce).

1989 Apoxsee, The Revised and Updated Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan

In 1985-86, Florida significantly revised its growth management legislation and created Chapter
9J-5 to guide local governments in revising their comprehensive plans. In updating the Future
Land Use Chapter, it was found that most of the development that had occurred within the
industrial areas, consisted of warehouse and distribution activities and services supporting the
construction industry and that there was little demand for additional industrial and warehouse
uses in the unincorporated County. As part of the County's efforts to revise and update the

                                                                           Rec'd by Planning Services 12/12/13




comprehensive plan, the County contracted with PHH Fantus Company, a nationally
recognized consultant specializing in industrial and office market feasibility studies to complete
this investigation.

The first phase of the PFF Fantus contract included verifying staff's projected office and industrial
demands and providing recommendations as to the amount of land that should be designated
for those uses. The second phase involved determining the desirability and viability of
designating areas for regional office parks and the allocation and distribution of those uses
based upon locational criteria. The PHH Fantus report highlighted the importance of I-75 not only
as an important first impression to visitors but its integral role in the economic development of the
County by providing access to regional and national markets.

On March 13, 1989, the Sarasota County Commission adopted a Revised and Updated Sarasota
County Comprehensive Plan, based upon the state mandated Evaluation and Appraisal Report
(EAR) and revised growth management statutes and rules. The 1989 Future Land Use Plan Map
refined the Industrial Areas concept, renamed them "Major Employment Centers" and
expanded the concept to promote economic diversification in line with the PHH Fantus Report,
the recommendations of the Interstate Planning Advisory Committee and several local
economic development organizations and chambers of commerce. In recognition of the role
the recently opened Interstate 75 (I-75) was to play towards the County's economic health and
vitality, additional lands at key interstate interchanges were designated MEC and a new subset
­ Interstate Regional Office Parks (IROP), this included new designations at the University
Parkway, Fruitville and Jacaranda Boulevard I-75 interchanges, consistent with the evaluation of
potential interstate regional office park development conducted for the County's I-75 Corridor
Plan. Undeveloped industrial areas in the Laurel Road and River Road area which lacked easy
access to I-75 were reduced in size; and acknowledged that further refinement of those areas
may be appropriate.

I-75 Corridor Plan

The I-75 Corridor Plan which was also adopted in 1989 was prepared to investigate and
determine the most appropriate future land uses along the I-75 corridor to:

       ·       achieve a diversified and stable economic base;
       ·       ensure future development is coordinated with the preservation, conservation or
               enhancement of the natural environment;
       ·       ensure future development is coordinated with a safe convenient and efficient
               traffic circulation system;
       ·       ensure the coordination of adequate infrastructure and services concurrent with
               land development; and
       ·       enhance the visual quality and image of I-75.

In the development of the I-75 Corridor Plan, a comparative analysis of 25 potential sites along I-
75 was performed to determine the relative potential for MEC development and of those, 14
potential sites were also evaluated to determine the relative potential for IROP development.
Criteria for IROP development included: direct access to regional transportation links, ready
access to labor supply, amount of vacant and developable land, minimal land use
compatibility conflicts, proximity to a Commercial Highway Interchange, and the ability to
promote a gateway concept. Ultimately, areas designated for IROP in the I-75 Corridor Plan
included lands on the east and west side of University Parkway, lands in the northwest quadrant
of Fruitville Road and in the southeast quadrant of Jacaranda Boulevard. Note: Other sites
considered but not designated IROP included lands east on Fruitville Road, lands east on Bee

Ridge Road, lands in the southwest quadrant of Clark Road (St. Leo parcel) and lands in all four
quadrants of the Venice Connector (S.R. 681).

Palmer Ranch Development of Regional Impact

On December 18, 1984, the Sarasota Board of County Commissioners approved the Palmer
Ranch Development of Regional Impact (DRI) by issuing the Master Development Order (MDO)
(Resolution No. 84-418) for the Palmer Ranch properties generally located east of U.S. 41, north of
Preymore Street, south of Clark Road, and west of I-75 in Sarasota County, Florida. The Palmer
Ranch DRI was approved for 10,500 residential dwelling units; a planned industrial area and 99
acres ± of internal commercial, plus additional square footage of commercial/office
approved/planned in designated Commercial Centers. Since the 1984 approval Palmer Ranch
has added an additional 205.7 acres to the DRI MDO on four occasions without increasing the
number of dwelling units.

On June 20, 1989, the Sarasota County Commission adopted Resolution No. 89-205, which
approved Palmer Ranch Increment IV, known as the Palmer Park of Commerce, totaling 239.5
acres ±. Increment IV approved for a total of 1,756,000 square feet of office, light industrial,
warehousing and supportive commercial uses within the within the Palmer Park of Commerce.
The lands adopted as a part of the Park of Commerce were rezoned PCD/ILW (Planned
Commerce Development/Industrial, Light Manufacturing and Warehousing) and PCD/OPI
(Planned Commerce Development/Office, Professional and Institutional).

Increment IV was subsequently amended in 1997 (Resolution No. 97-026) to add an additional 22
acres ± (Parcels A-8 and A-9) located south of East Sawyer Loop Road, east of McIntosh Road,
and west of the Seminole Gulf Railroad. These additional lands were rezoned PCD/ILW, however,
no additional industrial or office square footage was added to the increment. Adopted on April
14, 1998 (Ordinance No. 98-038), Increment XII which is located the east of Increment IV, was
approved for 100,000 square feet of industrial uses and 20,000 square feet of commercial uses
on the 35.54 ± acre Palmer Ranch Parcels B-1 and B-2A. Parcel B-1 was rezoned PID and Parcel
B-2A was then zoned CG. Parcel B-1was subsequently zoned to ILW in 2007 and is currently
planned as a new car dealership.

On November 20, 2013, the Palmer Ranch Master Development Order (Resolution No. 91-170, as
amended) was amended to increase the total number of residential units allowed in the Palmer
Ranch DRI from 10,500 to 11,550. The original allocation of 10,500 units within the Palmer Ranch
Master Development Order was based on the application of the 1981 Sarasota County
Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Plan Map and the application of the Urban Area
Residential Checklist and Residential Density Matrix. Subsequent Comprehensive Plan updates
in 1989 and 1996 recognized the increased density and yield of residential units within Palmer
Ranch.

Clark Road Corridor Plan

Adopted by the Sarasota County Commission in 1995, the Clark Road Corridor Plan (No. 91-02-
SP), expanded the Clark Road MEC area beyond the boundaries of the industrial area
established in Comprehensive Plan Amendment No. 17 to include additional existing industrial
development north of Ashton Road and areas along the north side of Clark Road between
existing industrial and the Village II Commercial Center at Clark Road and Honore Avenue.
Although the Corridor Plan did not include areas within the Palmer Ranch DRI, it did
acknowledge the areas designated for planned commerce development in Increment IV.

1996 EAR-based Comprehensive Plan Update

The 1996 EAR-based amendment to the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Plan and Map
update (RU-27) refined the previously designated urban area with discrete land use

designations. The boundary of MEC areas based recognition of existing land uses and zoning,
potential infill opportunities, approved Critical Area Plans, such as the Clark Road Corridor Plan
and from approved Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs) such as the Palmer Ranch DRI. The
boundaries of the Clark Road MEC area were consistent with the 1995 Clark Road Corridor Plan
and The Palmer Ranch Increment IV. Presently, the Palmer Park of Commerce (Increment IV)
includes approximately one quarter of the total acreage within the Clark Road MEC area.

Major Employment Center Land Use Study

In 2006, Economics Research Associates (ERA) of Washington, D.C. was retained by EDAW, Inc.
of Atlanta on behalf of Sarasota County to prepare a comprehensive study of Major
Employment Center (MEC) land areas. The primary objective of the study was to assess
designated MECs areas to determine whether they are aligned with Sarasota County's
economic development goals, employment forecasts, and economic trends, and to provide
appropriate strategies to further the economic development within MEC areas. As part of this
study, the County Commissioners requested the study address the following key issues:

       ·       Future demand for MEC land uses;
       ·       The amount of acreage necessary to accommodate future employment growth;
       ·       How well existing MECs are functioning; and
       ·       Assess an appropriate employment and housing balance.

Completed in 2007, ERA submitted the Major Employment Center Land Use Study (MEC Study)
to Sarasota County. The MEC Study noted that changes in the labor force are a fundamental
index of overall economic development and are a key "driver" of demand for various types of
real estate, such as office and manufacturing space. The MEC Study noted that the
manufacturing and transportation sector, which is a typical MEC use comprised 11 % of the
County's total employment base in 1970, but only 7 % in 2007. Note: In 2012, the manufacturing
and transportation sector comprised 6.7 % of the total employment base of Sarasota County.

The 2007 MEC Study also noted that since the adoption of the 1989 Comprehensive Plan, only
the Lakewood Ranch Corporate Park, located east of I-75 on University Parkway and the
Gateway DRI, located west of I-75 and north of Fruitville have seen significant development
within the Major Employment Center (MEC) and Interstate Regional Office Park (IROP)
designated areas. Other MEC areas along I-75 in the north County area (Fruitville MEC area east
of I-75 and Cattlemen Road MEC west of I-75) have seen steady infill of industrial and
warehouses while other MEC areas have not.

The 2007 MEC Study noted that between 2000 and 2005, Sarasota County has steadily lost
industrial uses within its MEC areas. The vacancy rate in existing industrial "flex space" hovered
around 17 % in 2007. The Clark Road MEC area was no exception as it saw additional declines,
particularly in rail dependent industrial uses (i.e., gravel, mineral and cement, and lumber). At
the same time, Sarasota County saw gains in administrative, waste management, retail and the
service sectors.

At the time of the MEC Study, approximately 235 acres within the Clark Road MEC area were
vacant. The study noted, however, that unlike other MEC areas, the Clark Road MEC had
actually seen a negative absorption. Two main lumber businesses shuttered their doors, a
concrete batch plant and other concrete and stone businesses and the Winn-Dixie warehouse
have closed. The MEC Study also noted that some sites, such as the Winn-Dixie warehouse (now
referred to as the Meridian Business Center) were being repurposed. The recent approval of
Special Exception No. 1674 permitted the construction of the 54,394 square foot charter school
(Imagine School) within the Meridian Business Center. However, other buildings and sites within
the Meridian Business Center and the larger Clark Road MEC remain vacant.

The 2007 MEC Study also documented a very low intensity of development (.07 FAR) within the
Clark Road MEC. It noted that opportunities remain strong for infill and repurposing of aging and
obsolete properties within that MEC. It recommended that future development within this MEC
occur at industrial intensities (.28 FAR) typical of suburban industrial development patterns.

The 2007 MEC Study recommended that additional lands be designated for MEC uses in the
vicinity of the I-75 Corridor in Central and South Sarasota County. As land use patterns change,
the 2007 MEC Study also acknowledged that some areas designated for MEC uses may be less
appropriate. The Sarasota County Economic Development Corporation also recognizes I-75 as
the new "main street" in terms of economic development. Interstate connector roadways,
which link the interstate travel with major centers such as the downtown Sarasota business
district, also play an important role in attracting and retaining businesses. Conversely, the Clark
Road MEC area has not been able to attract or retain the amount or type of development that
found within the MEC areas on University Parkway or Fruitville Road.

Existing Conditions ­ Clark Road Major Employment Center

Since the adoption of the Clark Road Corridor Plan in 1995, there has been a substantial shift in
uses within the Clark Road MEC area. Presently, only 27% of the businesses within the Clark Road
MEC area are traditional industrial/manufacturing. Since 1998, auto-oriented commercial
development has expanded along Clark Road. Today, 42 auto-oriented businesses comprise
approximately 18% of the businesses within the Clark Road MEC area, and a mix of retail, office
and industrial uses account for 39% of the remaining businesses. The recent approval of Special
Exception No. 1716, for a 150,000 square foot furniture store within the ILW district (Madder
Brothers Furniture) on Clark Road as well as the Livingston's Amusement Center and the White
Buffalo Saloon are indicative of the change in uses and character of the Clark Road MEC area.
Pure office businesses account for only 5 %.

            Road and all but one was built on or after 1998. One used truck/equipment sales
            business is located off Ashton Road.
            ** Flex Space is defined as between 30 to 100 % office and/or retail.
            *** Almost 2,000,000 square feet of warehouse uses are located within the Meridian
            Business Center and Public Warehouse facility.

Market History and Demand

Since the adoption of Palmer Ranch Increment IV, development within the Palmer Park of
Commerce has been stagnant. Only 141,309 square feet of the approved 1,756,000 square feet
of retail, office and industrial uses have been developed east of McIntosh Road. Parcel A-2 is
designated for office uses and Parcel A-6 is designated for light industrial and warehouse uses.
Since the creation of the Palmer Park of Commerce in 1989, only 84,928 square feet of office
and warehouse uses have been developed. Efforts to market parcels within the Palmer Park of
Commerce have been unsuccessful. As documented in the 2007 MEC Study, the demand for
industrial and office uses has occurred in MEC areas adjacent to I-75. In addition to the MEC
areas along University Parkway, Fruitville Road, and Cattlemen Road in the unincorporated area,
and the City of Venice has seen steady growth in its industrial areas along Laurel and Knights
Trail Road. The only serious inquires Palmer Ranch receives for properties within the Palmer Park
of Commerce are for a multitude of residential uses. Attracted by the neighborhood amenities,
the demand for housing within Palmer Ranch outweighs the supply.

Given the evolution of this industrial area, the amount of vacant buildings and flex space
available within the Clark Road MEC area, focus should be placed not on promoting green-field
industrial development, but on encouraging infill and repurposing existing buildings. consistent
with the recommendations of the 2007 MEC Study.

Overall Impact of Proposed Comprehensive Plan Amendment

The applicant is proposing to re-designate Parcels A-2 and A-6 from MEC to Moderate Density
Residential (180 residential units). The companion NOPC to Palmer Ranch Increment IV does not
request a reduction of the 1,756,000 square feet of gross leasable area that was approved in the
initial Increment IV approval. No net loss of MEC square footage would occur with the
conversion of the 68-acre ± Parcels A-2 and A-6 from MEC to Moderate Density Residential.
Sufficient vacant acreage exists within the Palmer Park of Commerce to accommodate any
potential future industrial and office development.

On November 20, 2013, the Sarasota County Commission approved an NOPC to the Palmer
Ranch Master Development Order (Resolution No. 91-170, as amended) which increased the
total number of residential units allowed in the Palmer Ranch DRI from 10,500 to 11,550. The
original allocation of 10,500 units within the Palmer Ranch DRI MDO was based on the
application of the 1981 Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Plan Map and
the application of the Urban Area Residential Checklist and Residential Density Matrix. As
described above, this original allocation was made because in 1981 there was significantly less
density and yield of residential units for the Palmer Ranch. The Sarasota County 1996
Comprehensive Plan, which was in effect in December 2006, recognized the increased density
and yield of residential units. As explained below, the allocation of 10,500 units initially made in
1984 can be increased. Additional residential development on Palmer Ranch Parcels A-2 and A-
6 would be more in keeping with the residential development to the south and west and would
maximize the use of existing urban service facilities inside the urban service area which includes
Palmer Ranch.

IV. TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS

In addition to redesignating Parcels A-2 and A-6 from MEC to Moderate Density Residential, the
proposed Comprehensive Plan Amendment, if approved would remove Sawyer Loop Road
west of McIntosh Road to Clark Road (SR 72) from the Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan.
Sawyer Loop Road West could then be constructed as a local road by Taylor Morrison as part of
their development of Parcels A-2 and A-6. Sawyer Loop Road is designated as a two-lane minor
collector roadway on the Sarasota County Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan. The proposed
development plan for Parcels A-2 and A-6, subject to this comprehensive plan amendment,
requires that Sawyer Loop Road function as a locally designated roadway to be consistent with
the residential nature of the proposed development. As a two-lane minor collector roadway,
Sawyer Loop Road would be less compatible with the proposed residential community given its
proximity to the industrial uses to the north. The transportation analysis below demonstrates that
the transportation capacity benefit of this segment of Sawyer Loop Road is minor in the year
2035 horizon. In addition, a five-year generalized level-of-service analysis was performed for the
existing plus fully funded road network. This does not include the construction of Sawyer Loop
Road. The likelihood of construction of a two-lane minor collector roadway from west of
McIntosh Road to Clark Road within the five-year horizon is extremely low because its primary
function would be to provide access to the project parcel.

Findings

Taylor Morrison of Florida, Inc. plans to develop Parcels A2 and A6 within Increment IV of the
Palmer Ranch DRI with 180 single-family residential dwelling units. The development intensities
assumed by the Palmer Ranch 2009 Transportation Reanalysis for Parcel A2/A6 are 310,000
square feet of light industrial and 277,784 square feet of office. The net difference in trip
generation potential between the proposed development and assumed development is a
decrease of 574 AM peak-hour trips and a decrease of 498 PM peak-hour trips. The proposed
development's trips are less than the assumed development trips; therefore, adequate capacity
exists to support the proposed change.

The operating conditions at the McIntosh Road/Sawyer Loop Road intersection were evaluated
with the addition of the 180 single-family dwelling units for the existing conditions. The analysis
indicates that the intersection will operate at acceptable level-of-service standards and all
auxiliary lanes will have adequate storage to accommodate the queue length plus the
deceleration length. The existing northbound left turn pocket will need to be restriped as a left
turn lane. A southbound right turn lane warrant was conducted and indicates that a
southbound right turn lane is not warranted. However, depending on the gated entrance
configuration and the distance of the gate from McIntosh Road, a southbound right turn lane
may be needed to prevent the stacking of vehicles at the gate from backing out into the
southbound through lane.

In addition, a five-year short-term and 2035 long-term analysis were conducted for the
comprehensive plan amendment to remove Sawyer Loop Road west of McIntosh Road to Clark
Road from the Future Thoroughfare Plan. Sawyer Loop Road is presentlydesignated as a two-
lane minor collector roadway. The proposed development plan, subject to this comprehensive
plan amendment, provides for Sawyer Loop Road function as a locally designated roadway to
be consistent with the residential nature of the development.

The five-year generalized level-of-service analysis was performed for the existing plus fully funded
road network and indicates that all segments within the study area are anticipated to operate
within Sarasota County's adopted level-of-service standards for the 2018 traffic conditions. The
2035 conditions were evaluated with and without the subject segment of Sawyer Loop Road
and show that the effect of removing Sawyer Loop Road from west of McIntosh Road to Clark
Road on the 2035 network is essentially neutral.

V. COMPREHENSIVE PLAN CONSISTENCY
Chapter 163.3177 Florida Statutes (F.S.) requires comprehensive plans to establish meaningful
and predictable standards for the use and development of land. Subsection 163.77(2) F.S. also
requires local comprehensive plan elements be coordinated and consistent.

The proposed amendments to the Transportation Chapter and Future Land Use Chapter do not
inhibit or obstruct any goals, objectives, or policies of the Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan.
They are consistent with and further the following goals, objectives and policies of the Sarasota
County Comprehensive Plan, consistent with Chapter 163 F.S.

Transportation Plan
TRAN Goal 1

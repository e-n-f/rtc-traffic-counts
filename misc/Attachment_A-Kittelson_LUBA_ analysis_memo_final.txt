Subject:      Land Use Board of Appeals - Traffic Impact Analysis Response to Comments


This memorandum provides a supplemental analysis of traffic operations at the SE Yaquina Bay
Road/SE Running Spring intersection for the proposed Teevin Bros. Log Yard development located in
Newport, Oregon. A traffic impact analysis for the proposed development was first submitted in
January 2013, and the project was subsequently appealed to the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals
(LUBA) by local residents. This memorandum addresses the second assignment of error identified in
the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA No. 2013-057) Final Opinion and Order dated November 6, 2013.


LUBA REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS
As shown on Page 9 (beginning on Line 17) of the LUBA Final Opinion and Order (Reference 1), the
following language summarizes the request for additional analysis at the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE
Running Spring intersection:

The proposed log yard fronts Yaquina Bay Road, an arterial or collector street that meets SE Running
Springs Road and, together, they form an intersection that is "along the site frontage and within the
access spacing distance[] extending out from the boundary of [the proposed log yard's] frontage." NMC
14.45.030(A). Accordingly, the TIA was required to include and address that intersection. The city's
finding that the supplemental TIA addresses the SE Running Spring Road/SE Yaquina Bay Boulevard
intersection is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The city's finding that the SE Running
Spring Road/SE Yaquina Bay Boulevard intersection need not be considered, simply because it was not
included under city staff scoping, is inconsistent with the text of NMC 14.45.030(A).

The second assignment of error is sustained.

The requested analysis is summarized in the following sections.

November 26, 2013                                                                                        Page 2



INTERSECTION OPERATIONS THRESHOLDS
Traffic operations at unsignalized intersections are generally described using a measure known as
“level-of-service” in accordance with Highway Capacity Manual analysis procedures. Level of service
represents ranges in the average amount of delay that motorists experience when passing through the
intersection. Level-of-service is measured on an “A” (best) to “F” (worst) scale. At two-way stop-
controlled intersections, level-of-service is reported based on the average delay experienced by the
critical movement at the intersection, typically a left-turn (or a right-turn if no left-turns are present)
from a stop-controlled street. A detailed description of level of service is provided in Attachment A.

Per conversations with City of Newport staff, the City has not adopted level-of-service standards for
streets that are under its jurisdiction. Rather, City staff depends on the traffic engineer’s assessment of
intersection level-of-service, volume-to-capacity ratio, and queuing analysis to assess intersection
operations. This assessment is provided herein.


SE YAQUINA BAY ROAD/SE RUNNING SPRING INTERSECTION ANALYSIS
A supplemental analysis was prepared that addresses the anticipated level-of-service and volume-to-
capacity ratio impacts at the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE Running Spring intersection. Traffic volumes were
collected on a typical mid-week day in November 2013 during the weekday a.m. (7:00-9:00 a.m.) and
weekday p.m. (4:00-6:00 p.m.) commuter peak hours. The data is shown in Attachment B. Consistent
with the January 2013 TIA, operations analyses were conducted with the traffic engineering software
package Synchro.


Existing Conditions Analysis
An existing conditions analysis was prepared for the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE Running Spring
intersection based on the traffic volume data collected. The intersection level-of-service evaluation
uses the peak 15-minute flow rate during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Using the peak 15-
minute flow rate ensures that this analysis is based on a reasonable worst-case scenario. For this
reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to occur for 15 minutes out of each average
peak hour. The transportation system will likely operate under conditions better than those described
in this memorandum during all other time periods.

The 2013 existing conditions analysis is summarized in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, the SE Yaquina
Bay Road/SE Running Spring intersection operates at level-of-service “A” and volume-to-capacity ratios
of 0.02 and 0.01 under weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour conditions, respectively. The existing traffic
operations output sheets are provided in Attachment C.

Trip Generation
The trip generation and assignment for this analysis is based on the January 2013 TIA1. The added trips
through the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE Running Spring intersection were added in the eastbound and
westbound direction for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours and are summarized in Figure 1.


Total Conditions Analysis
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE Running Spring
intersection is forecast to operate with the traffic generated by the proposed development. The
estimated site-generated traffic was added to the existing traffic volumes during the weekday a.m. and
p.m. peak hours (shown in Figure 1) to arrive at the total traffic volumes, also shown in Figure 1. As
shown, the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE Running Spring intersection is forecast to continue to operate
acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Table 1 below summarizes the impact of the
added traffic to the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE Running Spring intersection.

operate similarly to the existing conditions during both the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The
total traffic operations output sheets are provided in Attachment D.


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The analysis shown herein demonstrates that the SE Yaquina Bay Road/SE Running Spring intersection
operates at level-of-service “A” both under both existing conditions and under total traffic conditions
(includes the traffic impacts of the Teevin Bros. development). As such, the analysis complies with NMC
14.45.050(D) because the projected impacts are not forecast to cause excessive queuing or delays at
the affected intersection, resulting in no significant impact.

LEVEL-OF-SERVICE AT UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual provides models for estimating average control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. Table B3 provides a qualitative description of each LOS category
as it applies to unsignalized intersections, and Table B4 identifies the average control delay threshold
point used as the boundary for each LOS category. LOS thresholds for the specific reviewing
jurisdiction(s) are described in the body of the report.

    Service
                            Nearly all drivers find freedom of operation with very little time spent waiting for an
         A                   acceptable gap.
                            Very seldom is there more than one vehicle in queue.
                            Some drivers begin to consider the average control delay an inconvenience, but acceptable
         B                   gaps are still very easy to find.
                            Occasionally there is more than one vehicle in queue.
                            Average control delay becomes noticeable to most drivers, even though acceptable gaps are
                             found on a regular basis.
         C
                            It is not uncommon for an arriving driver to find a standing queue of at least one additional
                             vehicle.
                            Average control delay is long enough to be an irritation to most drivers. Average control
         D                   delay is long because acceptable gaps are hard to find, because there is a standing queue of
                             vehicles already waiting when the driver arrives, or both.
                            Drivers find the length of the average control delay approaching intolerable levels.
                            Average control delay is long because acceptable gaps are hard to find, because there is a
          E                  standing queue of vehicles already waiting when the driver arrives, or both.
                            There may or may not be substantial excess capacity remaining at the intersection when this
                             condition is encountered.
                            Most drivers encountering this condition consider the length of the average control delay to
                             be too long.
                            Average control delay is long because acceptable gaps are hard to find, because there is a
          F
                             standing queue of vehicles already waiting when the driver arrives, or both.
                            There may or may not be substantial excess capacity remaining at the intersection when this
                             condition is encountered.

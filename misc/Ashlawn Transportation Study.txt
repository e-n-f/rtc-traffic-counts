896937     WE have a walking bus and there is a group that walks together each morning The school will not allow children
           younger then 3rd grade walk home alone

897151     I am a school employee and live out of the county. I was told by child's school that she could no longer take the bus.
           That employees are on their own. If I was allowed for my child to take the bus it would save me 40 minutes of driving
           in Arlington where I could be at my APS school preparing/planning and could be productive in my own APS job. I wish
           this would be reconsidered.

897171     Ashlawn will need more bike racks if more students start biking. Also, it would be great to have a paved path going up
           the hill from the baseball fields at Bluemont to Manchester, and also a stop sign at the intersection of Kensington and
           the bike trail. Another obstacle to walking/biking is that kids have heavy backpacks to carry, so rethinking homework
           assignments would help a lot.

897186     My children are very young, so their age is the main factor in our ability to bike to and from school. Getting to work on
           time is a secondary concern, but it does factor in. We also have to cross both George Mason and Wilson Blvd. It's
           okay because we walk and bike frequently, but it is not the safest of intersections. Our goal this school year is to bike
           to and from school at least once a week, weather permitting.

897452     My kids have special needs and cannot bike to school currently.

904310     I encourage the school to build as small a new parking lot as possible once the school expands. If there is parking,
           people will drive. If Arlington is serious about its Car Free Diet, APS need to make a stronger effort to make people
           walk and let their children take the bus. We also need more sidewalks, for example on Manchester St. below the
           Sunrise facility; as well as zebra walks at intersections around the school, including at the back entrance.

904387     I strongly believe that children elementary and middle school children (at least through 6th grade)should have more
           supervision when walking or biking to school. Some people do not respect the speed limits and that creates an unsafe
           environment for our children.

907166     We greatly appreciate the crossing guard at Wilson Blvd. The dangerous partof our walk is after we cross the south
           side of wilson and try to navigate 8th Rd.There are no sidewalks and too many moving and turning cars. There is no
           way to teach my children to safely navigate this kind of street.

907174     My child is pk, some of the questions do not apply to my child

908237     The path behind school (Montague) needs lighting and better upkeep. Also a ramp is needed here for strollers and
           handicap access.

908300     Would like to see 8th Rd N a car and traffic free zone. It is very difficult to cross because of high speed traffic and
           illegally parked cars.

908315     Question 10 - These situations can not be improved to the extent that I would feel comfortable.

908339     My fear of child abduction is why I will not let my child walk to school alone ever.

896942     Creating walking groups to school and going back home would be great. More families would be willing to walk if
           these groups were created. Have more crossing guards or patrols to assist children to cross neighborhood streets.

897003     On our walk to school there are places with no sidewalk on eiher side of the street. The sidewalks near Ashlawn are
           too narrow and should be widened as part of or in conjunction with the Ashlawn renovation work. The sidewalks on
           Wilson are inadequate, blocked by utilities and other obstacles and are a civic embarrassment for Arlington. Ashlawn
           PTA and Principal should consider asking the County to improve this.

897064     My son is developmentally disabled, so I am concerned more about his own judgment than anything else -- though
           2nd grade is probably still a little soon.

897100     If I lived closer to the school and they arranged walking groups i would be inclined to send my child via bike or walking.

897158     Both my husband and I work. My husband works 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. and I work 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. We like using the
           morning extended day so we can have a full afternoon/evening together as a family.

897280     I worry about fast cars and kidnapping. I would rather encourage bus and car transport.

897437     My child is an exception because he has developmental delays




                                                                                                                        Page 12 of 15
904286   We either ride the bus or drive in the morning, depends if our son is ready in time to catch the bus. He rides the bus
         home every day unless there is something after school that he needs to get to.

904313   Thank you for your work to address this.

904315   To encourage the younger grades to be able to walk home i Would love to see patrols along the bike path or groups
         walking home along the bike path with patrols.

904325   My child has cerebral palsy and walking more than a couple of blocks before or after school is challenging. The
         distance from our house to the school could take him a half an hour or more.

907146   Would support walking / riding school bus

907176   My greatest concern is when my child is walking just outside the school and there are many people driving in circles
         looking for parking. They become late and rushed.

907944   The car drop of situation for Montessori children is a mess. This morning the road was blocked by to the right at the
         entrance of the school. Would not allow me to park and walk my 3 year old to the classroom so I instead had to park 2
         blocks away and walk her.

907961   We allow our 4th grader to walk or ride with friends in a group, not bu himself. Our 2nd grader can not walk by
         himself and our 6th grader walks in a group.

907970   Since my son attends extended day we drop him off on the way to work and on the way home.

907978   We live within walking distance of two schools and are assigned to a school further away - too far to walk or bike to.
         We love Ashlawn but ther school boundaries make no sense to us.

907987   We would like our child to walk to school as much as possible. Lack of sidewalks and long, busy streets are our
         biggest concerns, particularly 8th Rd N.

908102   We are out of neighborhood

908112   We need a sidewalk on the deadend portion of 8th Rd by the stairs where walkers descend.

896940   I am a working mother who does not have the time before and after school to walk to school.

897170   I leave for work pretty early in the morning and my daughter goes to Extended Care. I would let her walk if there were
         other children walking at that time, but there usually are not.

904353   1. for extended day I am required to walk into the building to sign my child in/out; I've interpreted this to mean they're
         not allowed to walk to/from school without an adult designated by me to sign for them. Someone told me when her
         brother turns 13 he'll be allowed to sign her out - I hope that is true, but I think a third grader with my written
         permission should be allowed to sign herself out to walk home at a prespecified time. 2. Offering extended day
         services for preschool would have saved me 40 minutes driving per day for the years my older child has been at
         Ashlawn, since my younger child has been 3 miles away at private preschool. Having them in the same place means
         my husband can walk them to school and take the city bus (when he is not on business travel). 3. When my husband
         is on travel, if school starts at 8:35 and I have a 20 minute driving commute, to pick up by 6:00 and bill 8 hours as a
         government contractor, and actually take a 20 minute unpaid lunch break, I do not have time to park at my house and
         walk to/from school to drop off/pick up my children (unless I pay for morning extended day). Having a friend pick up
         creates problems b/c it turns into a a playdate and hard to get kids back on track for homework and dinner. 4. There
         is no bus service for our street and it is well over half a mile as the crow flies (0.96 miles driving), up a steep hill. The
         town I grew up in provided bus services for kids who lived < half a mile from the school if they lived on a steep hill.

904357   My child is a Safety Patrol on the Bus and therefore she has a responsibility to ride the bus every morning. This
         survey does not take this role into account at all. My children stay at school for Extended Day so technically, they do
         not have the option of bus, walking, or biking in the afternoon. They will be picked up when I get back from work and
         no amount of encouragement is going to change this.

907066   Questions 10 and 11 are confusing

907204   Please add a sidewalk to stretch of 8th Rd. adjacent to Dhara field.

907958   My kids are too young to walk to school and the new bus stops are so far away that driving is more convenient than
         going to the bus stop. Also, my children are 5 minutes away when I drive and 40 minutes when they ride the bus.

908114   I need a bus for the girls because it is too dangerous from our house to the school.

908268   Dropping off and picking up is our only option because of our work schedules. Our daughter attends extended day




                                                                                                                        Page 13 of 15
908307   While elementary school allows for choice of walking or bus, our middle school will not.I would like there to be a bus
         due to busy intersections.

908336   Cynthia is too little to ride a bike right now and I am pregnant but I will consider letting her bike once the baby is born

896946   The distance we live from Ashlawn school and the fact that my son would have to walk for a very long time by himself
         on either the Bikepath or along Wilson Blvd makes the school bus our best solution at this time. If he was in the
         attendance area for the schools that are actually the closest to us (ATS and then Barrett), he would be able to walk to
         school.

896980   Getting other parents to allow their children to walk and bike with my children has made walking and biking much
         more desirable. It took a bit of effort to find other children and still working on it. We were bus riders in past years but I
         have realized the kids get home 15-20 minutes earlier by walking. not a lot of time but it helps so much for getting
         some wind down time, snack, and getting ready for afterschool activities and even homework done. There is nothing
         convenient about the bus except that I don't have to meet it after school and my chidren can walk home by
         themselves. They can't walk just from school on their own.

897152   Elementary School crossing guards are very passive and not very communicative, specifically at Manchester St and
         8th Rd (Ashlawn). I would feel more comfortable with my child walking if this situation were better or if there was an
         adult crossing guard. Many drivers coming and going from the school, including parents, are inattentive and impatient
         - just plain dangerous.

897262   My fourth grader walks to school early to attend morning PE with two other fourth graders. I would not let him walk
         completely alone.

897265   I'm not sure if I would allow my child to walk to Ashlawn, which requires crossing Wilson Blvd, at any age, but I think
         that a speed/red light camera at that traffic light would be helpful in getting most drivers to adjust their speed on that
         stretch of road.

897338   Difficult to answer these questions - especially #10 & #11 because right now my son is way too young to walk/bike
         to/from school PLUS we live too far away 1.5 miles across very busy streets!

897538   The most dangerous part of our walk to school is the portion right near the school. Parents park on the dead-end
         section of 8th Road, and then have to then do a u-turn with little space to do so. We must walk down that street with
         no sidewalk, and it is narrow. Often cars are competing for spaces, too, so they double-park or wait next to a parked
         car. I think the dead end should be closed to traffic beyond the school parking lot.

904366   With the late start time, I must drive my children through the drive through lanes in order for me to get to work on time.
         I pick them up and help them walk home. I would not let them walk up the 8th with no sidewalks, across Wilson and
         through the neighborhoods without an adult. Too much fast moving traffic, etc. for them to negotiate safely. Ashlawn
         is a very hard school to get to and from.

906607   Way to school is through the forest parkland.

907113   lots of bus and car fumes on walk

907137   We walk sometimes, which takes me 30-40 mins to walk, drop off, and get home. With work, I have difficulty fitting in
         this walk time.

907143   Walk together to school once a week or so

907187   I am a working mother and I don't have the time in the morning and afternoon to walk back and forth to school.

908107   I let my younger son bike if he is with his older brother. Our biggest challenge is the need to get home in time for
         soccer practice.

908134   I like walking to school when possible, and my kids enjoy it too. The bus makes it easy because of our short times in
         both the mornings and afternoon

907177   I wish that for specifically winter time the scool had a bus for my child because it is very difficult to walk to school

908072   The question does not address the isolation of the most logical (geographically) route. The isolated bike trail is
         impractical.

897147   My child would have to cross Arlington Blvd, which I would not cross myself.

897302   We live too far away for my child to walk or bike to school. This would not be an option no matter what items listed
         above were changed.

907976   My child lives too far from school


                                                                                                                        Page 14 of 15
904308   My husband and I both work more than a full time schedule. On occasion, we can walk with our son to or from school.
         However, I am not willing to have my child walk home from school by himself at 5:30 or 6pm when I return home when
         there is no crossing guard on Wilson Blvd and during rush hour traffic. Same goes for before 8am which is when we
         usually drop him off at extended day. I never drive to the school during the regular drop-off or pick-up times as we are
         at work during those times.

904309   My child goes to HB and it is too far for a 12 year old to walk or bike.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location and Description
The existing Cary Park development has several undeveloped parcels in the vicinity of the
Carpenter Fire Station Road and Green Level Church Road intersection. One parcel, Tract MR-
8, is proposed to be developed for a residential apartment complex consisting of 235 dwelling
units. Tract MR-8 is located in the southeast quadrant of the Carpenter Fire Station Road and
Cary Glen Boulevard intersection in western Cary. Trip generation rates were used from the ITE
Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to determine the amount of trips the site would generate. The
trip generation summary is shown in Table 1.

The site plan for this parcel proposes to provide one full movement access on Cary Glen
Boulevard between Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Reserve Drive. The site plan also
proposes to utilize an existing right-in/right-out driveway on Carpenter Fire Station Road,
proposed to be relocated approximately 100 feet to the west of its existing location by an
adjacent development. This existing driveway currently serves a veterinary hospital and will
provide a shared access to a proposed office building and to the veterinary hospital, in addition to
the proposed apartments after the relocation. This traffic study, 13-TAR-363, analyzes the
effects of the apartment development on traffic operations in the study area. Figure ES-1 shows
the study area for 13-TAR-363 while Figure ES-2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
The number of trips generated by the proposed apartments will exceed the Town's 50 peak hour
trip threshold for redevelopment (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4) and
therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Adequate Public Facilities
Ordinance (APFO). The projected build-out year for this development is 2015. This TAR
analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers
potential mitigation for those impacts.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
   ·   05-2215 ­ Carpenter Fire Station Road and Green Level Church Road (signalized)

                                               ES-1
                                                                                      13-TAR-363
                                                                                           FINAL


   ·   9001 ­ Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (unsignalized)
   ·   9002 ­ Carpenter Fire Station Road and Existing Right-in/Right-out Driveway (future
       proposed Access 2) (unsignalized)
   ·   05-2378 ­ Green Level Church Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (signalized)


Traffic analyses were performed for the proposed site entrances and the study area intersections
listed above for four scenarios, specifically:
   ·   Existing (2012) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts, aerial photography, site visit, and existing signal and timing data).
   ·   Background (2015) ­ Estimates future (2015) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 4%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby developments that
       have not yet been constructed.
   ·   Combined (2015) ­ Adds the site generated traffic from the proposed apartments to the
       Background (2015) volumes.
   ·   Combined and Improved (2015) ­ Analyzes potential mitigations to provide acceptable
       levels of service based on the Town's LDO.

Background (2015) Analysis
Future traffic estimates were made based on applying a 4% average annual growth rate (AAGR)
to the 2012 balanced counts. Also, traffic from the following approved developments was
considered and incorporated as appropriate:
           ·   09-TAR-149A ­ Cameron Pond Update
           ·   12-TAR-346 ­ Cary Glen Townhomes
           ·   12-TAR-348 ­ Cary Park Parcel TC-3A

APFO Required Mitigations
One intersection fell below the APFO threshold with the additional site traffic. As such, mitigation
was recommended for this intersection which is described below and shown in Figure ES-3.

   Intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
   This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, operating at LOS F in both the
   AM and PM peak periods in the Combined (2015) conditions with increased delay from the
   Background (2015) conditions. There is also one movement, the shared southbound through
   and right-turn, operating at LOS F in the PM peak period in the Combined (2015) conditions.
   This movement operates at LOS E in the PM peak period in the Background (2015)
   conditions. Additionally, all movements on the northbound approach operate at LOS F in
   both the AM and PM peak periods in the Combined (2015) conditions. These movements
   operate at LOS C in both the AM and PM peak periods in the Background (2015) conditions.
   All of these movements require mitigation based on the Town's APFO. Several geometric
   improvements were considered, such as exclusive turn lanes, but they did not provide the
   necessary improvement in delay. Therefore, due to the increase in delay for a movement
                                              ES-2
                                                                                      13-TAR-363
                                                                                           FINAL


   operating at LOS F and the degradation of several movements to LOS F, an evaluation of
   peak hour signal warrants was performed and is included in Appendix I. The peak hour
   signal warrant evaluation indicates this intersection will meet peak hour warrants in the
   Combined (2015) scenario. According to the Town of Cary, a signal warrant analysis has
   recently been performed and agreed upon by NCDOT. Based on this and the APFO
   requirements, a signal is required to be installed at the intersection of Carpenter Fire Station
   Road and Cary Glen Boulevard as mitigation for site traffic. This intersection was analyzed
   as a two-phase signalized intersection in the Combined Improved conditions, which resulted
   in overall LOS A operations with all movements operating at LOS A in the AM and PM peak
   periods.

   Table 2a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the 2015 Background, 2015
   Combined, and 2015 Combined and Improved conditions and shows that both intersections
   need no mitigation to meet the APFO requirements. Table 2b provides a comparison of the
   unsignalized intersections in the 2015 Background, 2015 Combined, and 2015 Combined and
   Improved conditions. As shown in Table 2b, without mitigation, the Carpenter Fire Station
   Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection does not meet the APFO requirements. With the
   proposed mitigation, the intersection satisfies the requirements of the APFO. Table 2b also
   shows that the two proposed access driveways meet the APFO requirements in the 2015
   Combined conditions and do not require mitigation.

Additional Information
The intersection of Cary Glen Boulevard and Proposed Access 1 does not require mitigation;
however, the site plan provided does not provide the exact location of the intersection of Access
1 and Cary Glen Boulevard. Therefore, the distance from proposed Access 1 (onto Cary Glen
Boulevard) to either of the adjacent intersections is not known. It is preferable to locate Access 1
such that this access point will have the least possible impact on the intersections of Cary Glen
Boulevard and Carpenter Fire Station Road as well as Cary Glen Boulevard and Cary Reserve
Drive. Based on the data available at this time, it appears that placing Access 1 approximately
mid-way between these two intersections (currently located around 750 feet apart) would be the
optimum location.

1.       INTRODUCTION
The existing Cary Park development has several undeveloped parcels in the vicinity of the
Carpenter Fire Station Road and Green Level Church Road intersection. One parcel, Tract MR-
8, is proposed to be developed for a residential apartment complex consisting of 235 dwelling
units. Tract MR-8 is located in the southeast quadrant of the Carpenter Fire Station Road and
Cary Glen Boulevard intersection in western Cary. The site plan for this parcel proposes to
provide one full movement access on Cary Glen Boulevard between Carpenter Fire Station Road
and Cary Reserve Drive. The site plan also proposes to utilize an existing right-in/right-out
driveway on Carpenter Fire Station Road, proposed to be relocated approximately 100 feet to the
west of its existing location by an adjacent development. This existing driveway currently serves
a veterinary hospital and will provide a shared access to a proposed office building and to the
veterinary hospital, in addition to the proposed apartments after the relocation. Figure 1
provides the study area and site location. All figures are located in Appendix A.

The number of trips generated by the proposed apartments will exceed the Town's 50 peak hour
trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4) and
therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Adequate Public Facilities
Ordinance (APFO). The projected build-out year for this development is 2015. This TAR
analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers
potential mitigation for those impacts. The site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections along with the proposed full
movement access on Cary Glen Boulevard (the Synchro intersection number is provided before
the intersection name):
     ·   05-2215 ­ Carpenter Fire Station Road and Green Level Church Road (signalized)
     ·   9001 ­ Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (unsignalized)
     ·   9002 ­ Carpenter Fire Station Road and Existing Right-in/Right-out Driveway (future
         proposed Access 2) (unsignalized)
     ·   05-2378 ­ Green Level Church Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (signalized)

Existing signal plans and signal timing plans were obtained from NCDOT and the Town of Cary,
as available and used in the analysis. They are located in Appendix B.

2.      EXISTING (2012) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.

        2.1.1. CARPENTER FIRE STATION ROAD (SR 1624)
        Carpenter Fire Station Road is an east-west connector that is posted 45 mph east of
        Yates Store Road and 35 mph west of Yates Store Road and runs from Allforth Place in
        Chatham County east to Morrisville Carpenter Road in Cary, NC and provides access to
        the commuter routes, Triangle Expressway and NC 55. The typical section of Carpenter
        Fire Station Road is mostly a four-lane, median divided roadway in the study area that
        narrows to a two-lane, undivided section just east of Cameron Pond Drive. The Town of
        Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies the vision to widen the entire
        length of Carpenter Fire Station Road to a four-lane median-divided facility in the future.
        Carpenter Fire Station Road had a 2011 AADT of 11,000 vehicles just west of NC 55
        (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

        2.1.2. GREEN LEVEL CHURCH ROAD (SR 1625)
        Green Level Church Road is a major north-south connector, is posted 45 mph in the
        study area, and runs from NC 55 north of the Wake/Durham County Line to US 64 in
        Apex. The typical section of Green Level Church Road within the study limits is a four-
        lane median-divided roadway. During a field investigation of the study area, construction
        was underway to extend the four-lane cross-section south of Morrisville Parkway. Green
        Level Church Road had a 2011 AADT of 7,900 vehicles per day just south of its
        intersection with Carpenter Fire Station Road (based on the 2011 NCDOT traffic volume
        map).

        2.1.3. CARY GLEN BOULEVARD
        Cary Glen Boulevard is a 35 mph north-south collector road that runs from McCrimmon
        Parkway in the northern portion of the study area southwest to Weldon Ridge Boulevard.
        From McCrimmon Parkway, Cary Glen Boulevard crosses Green Level Church Road and
        connects with a large residential area to the southwest. The typical section of Cary Glen
        Boulevard within the study limits is a two-lane roadway with a center two-way left-turn
        lane north of Carpenter Fire Station Road and a two-lane undivided roadway south of
        Carpenter Fire Station Road.

        2.1.4. CARY RESERVE DRIVE
        Cary Reserve Drive is a collector/access road that provides a connection between Cary
        Glen Boulevard and Carpenter Fire Station Road. Cary Reserve Drive is a two-lane
        roadway with sections of right-angle parking.

2.2.       Existing Intersections
All intersections within the study area that were analyzed are listed in Section 1 of this report.
All intersections are within the Town Limits of Cary or within the Town of Cary's ETJ.
Intersection geometrics along with intersection operation controls are provided in Figure 3.

2.3.       Turning Movement Counts
Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
October 2012 for all intersections. Panther Creek High School is located north of the study
area for this site and Mills Park Elementary School and Mills Park Middle School are both
located to the south. All three of these schools were in session when the counts were taken.
The count data is located in Appendix C. These counts were taken to provide current
volumes and assist in determining the directional splits of existing traffic. The count volumes
were balanced in areas where appropriate and grown three years at the determined growth
rate (discussed in Section 3.1) to estimate 2015 volumes. The volumes that were used in the
analyses are shown on Figure 4 and the volume calculations are located in Appendix D.
The following table, Table 1, lists the time and place counts were conducted.

2.4. Level of Service Criteria for Stop-controlled and Signalized
     Intersections
Exhibit 18-4 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
signalized intersections. The criteria for level of service of a signalized intersection are
provided in Table 2 below.


            Table 2: Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections

                           F                       >80

Exhibit 19-1 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are provided in Table 3 below.

         Table 3: Level of Service Criteria for Stop-Controlled Intersections
                    Level of Service Average Control Delay (s/veh)

                           B                     >10-15
                           C                     >15-25

                           F                       >50


The proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone which is
described in Section 3.23.3 of the LDO. For areas located within the Base Benefit Zone, the
level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are based on achieving a
LOS D or better for all intersections located within the study area (measured overall for

                                                                                     FINAL


signalized intersections and by movement for unsignalized intersections) currently operating
at LOS D or better or not increasing delay (overall intersection delay for signalized and
movement for unsignalized) for those intersections/movements having a level of service
worse than LOS D without the development in the buildout year.

2.5.        Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. The following Synchro coding
assumptions were made for existing conditions and included in all future analyses unless
otherwise noted:

   ·    The westbound right-turn movement at Green Level Church Road and Cary Glen
        Boulevard was coded to not allow right turns on red (RTOR) based on field
        observations of signage and review of signal plans.
   ·    The unsignalized intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen
        Boulevard had u-turning movements in both peak periods. In these instances, u-
        turning movements were added to left-turning movements to provide a more realistic
        level of service since Synchro does not account for U-turn movements at unsignalized
        intersections in its level of service calculations. Synchro files with the u-turning
        movements were maintained for all scenarios for simulation purposes.

Levels of service and delay were reported for each yielding movement at unsignalized
intersections. For signalized intersections, levels of service and delay were reported for the
signal as a whole. The summary of the findings are located in Tables 4a and 4b below.

     As shown by Tables 4a and 4b, all intersections and movements operate better than the
     level of service criteria of LOS D for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone aside from one
     movement at one unsignalized intersection. The southbound left-turn at the unsignalized
     intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard operates at LOS E in
     the AM and PM peak periods. The 2012 Existing analysis results are located in Appendix E.



3.      BACKGROUND (2015) CONDITIONS
     3.1.      Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information, developing land uses in the area, and information
     from adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth rate of 4% was assumed for the
     study area. This growth rate was applied to the existing 2012 volumes to determine the
     projected volumes for the Background (2015) analysis. There were also additional trips
     added to account for known approved developments that are not yet constructed. These trips
     were based on other TARs provided by the Town of Cary. All additional developments are
     described in the following sections. Previously analyzed development trip generation
     information is located in Appendix F. The total approved development site trips included in
     the 2015 analyses can be found on Figure 5. The total 2015 background traffic volumes,
     including the approved development trips are shown in Figure 6. The following are the
     approved developments included in the background traffic for this TAR:

   3.1.1. 09-TAR-149A ­ CAMERON POND UPDATE
   The Cameron Pond Update is an amendment to the analysis performed for the existing
   Cameron Pond neighborhood. The update consists of an additional 15 home sites and is
   located on Carpenter Fire Station Road to the east of the study area for this analysis.
   Therefore, site traffic from the additional Cameron Pond development will be added to the
   background traffic and included in this analysis.

   3.1.2. 12-TAR-346 ­ CARY GLEN TOWNHOMES
   The Cary Glen Townhomes TAR was conducted for a development consisting of 152
   residential townhome units located in the parcel on the south side of Tract MR-8. The
   proposed build-out year for the Cary Glen Townhomes development is 2016; therefore,
   fifty percent of the site traffic from that development will be included in this analysis
   assuming fifty percent townhome occupation in the year 2015.

   3.1.3. 12-TAR-348 ­ CARY PARK PARCEL TC-3A
   The Cary Park Parcel TC-3A TAR was conducted for the proposed development of
   20,000 square feet of office space in the southeast quadrant of the Carpenter Fire Station
   Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection. This parcel is located on the north side of
   Tract MR-8 and upon completion, will result in a shared driveway serving an existing
   veterinary hospital and the office development. The proposed build-out year for this
   development is 2014; therefore, site traffic from the office development will be added to
   the background traffic and included in this analysis.

3.2.       Level of Service Analysis
Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2015) AM and PM peak periods which includes the approved development site
trips described in the above section along with the annual growth of existing traffic using the
4% annual growth rate. This analysis will be used as the base case to determine the impacts
for the development of Cary Park Tract MR-8 Apartments.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2015) analysis are shown by Figure 6. The
summary of the level of service analysis for the Background (2015) conditions is reported in
Tables 5a and 5b.

  The 2015 Background analysis indicates that one unsignalized intersection has movements
  that operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. The
  southbound left-turn at the unsignalized intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary
  Glen Boulevard operates at LOS F in the AM and PM peak periods. The southbound through
  and right-turn lane at this intersection operates at LOS E in the PM peak period. The 2015
  Background analyses are located in Appendix G.

4.      COMBINED (2015) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Zone and therefore recommendations will be based on a level of service standard of "D".
Tract MR-8 of the Cary Park Development is proposed to consist of 235 apartments. An existing
right-in/right-out driveway on Carpenter Fire Station Road currently serving a veterinary hospital
is proposed to be relocated approximately 100 feet to the west as part of an adjacent office
development. Upon the completion of the apartment development, this relocated driveway is
proposed to provide a consolidated right-in/right-out access off of Carpenter Fire Station Road for
the new office development, the veterinary hospital, and the Tract MR-8 proposed apartment
development. A full movement access is also proposed on Cary Glen Boulevard between
Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Reserve Drive, but its exact location is not known at this
time.

     4.1.       Trip Generation
     Trip generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to
     determine the amount of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is shown
     in Table 6 below.

     4.2.       Trip Distribution
     Access to the development is proposed to be provided via a full movement driveway on Cary
     Glen Boulevard and a relocated right-in/right-out driveway on Carpenter Fire Station Road as
     described in section 4.1 above. Trip distribution was estimated based on count data from
     nearby intersections, and from knowledge of local trip attractions and destinations in the area.
     The site distribution percentages are shown on Figure 7 and the site trips are shown on
     Figure 8. The trip generation and distribution calculations are located in Appendix D.

     4.3.       Combined (2015) Level of Service Analysis
     The Combined (2015) scenario consists of the background with approved development traffic
     as discussed in Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed
     apartment development on Tract MR-8. The volumes that are used in the Combined (2015)
     analysis are shown in Figure 9. The laneage and traffic control used for the Combined
     (2015) scenario is based on the existing conditions provided by Figure 3 with the addition of
     driveways as shown on the site plan in Figure 2.

   Level of service analyses were performed for all existing intersections and proposed Access
   1, including the existing right-in/right-out modifications as noted in Section 4.1. A summary of
   the levels of service are found in Tables 7a and 7b below.

  As seen in Tables 7a and 7b, most intersections experience little to no change between the
  Background (2015) and Combined (2015) scenarios.

  Based on the Combined (2015) analyses, one unsignalized intersection has several
  movements that operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation
  Zone.     The southbound left-turn, northbound shared through and left-turn, and the
  northbound right-turn movements for the Carpenter Fire Station and Cary Glen Boulevard
  intersection all operate at LOS F in both the AM and PM peak periods while the southbound
  shared through and right-turn movement operates at LOS F in the PM peak period. The
  results provided in Table 7b indicate that all three movements experience an increase in
  delay when compared to the background analyses. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at
  unsignalized intersections no movements are allowed to fall below the LOS D threshold or
  experience an increase in delay for movements that already operate below the LOS D
  threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, this intersection will require
  additional mitigation to meet the APFO. The mitigation is evaluated and described in Section
  4.4. The Combined (2015) analyses are located in Appendix H.

  The following provides the results of the 2015 Combined analysis and how they relate to the
  APFO requirements.

  Intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Green Level Church Road
  This intersection operates at LOS C in the AM and PM peak periods.               Therefore, this
  intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

  Intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
  This intersection has several movements (the shared northbound through and left-turn,
  northbound right-turn, and southbound left-turn) that operate at LOS F in the AM and PM
  peak periods and the shared southbound through and right-turn that operates at LOS F in the
  PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7b, above, indicate that each of these
  movements show an overall increase in delay when compared to the background analysis.
  Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
  unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base

Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to
meet the APFO requirements. These improvements are described in Section 4.4.

Intersection of Cary Glen Boulevard and Proposed Access 1
Since all movements at this intersection are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

The site plan provided does not show the distance from proposed Access 1 (onto Cary Glen
Boulevard) to either of the adjacent intersections. It is preferable to locate Access 1 such that
this access point will have the least possible impact on the intersections of Cary Glen
Boulevard and Carpenter Fire Station Road as well as Cary Glen Boulevard and Cary
Reserve Drive. Based on the data available at this time, it appears that placing Access 1
approximately mid-way between these two intersections (currently located around 750 feet
apart) would be the optimum location.

Intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Right-In/Right-Out Driveway / Proposed
Access 2
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better, this intersection does not
require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Green Level Church Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
This intersection operates at LOS B in the AM peak period and LOS A in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

4.4.       Combined (2015) Improved Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2015) Improved scenario consists of improvements identified as mitigations
that are proposed in order to meet the LOS D threshold or show no increase in overall
intersection/movement delay if the intersection/movement operates below LOS D in the
background condition as noted in Section 4.3. As noted in Section 4.3, one intersection
meets these criteria in the Combined (2015) conditions. The intersection requiring mitigation
is listed below, along with the proposed mitigation. The 2015 Combined with Improvements
Synchro analyses are located in Appendix I.

Intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, operating at LOS F in both the
AM and PM peak periods in the Combined (2015) conditions with increased in delay from the
Background (2015) conditions. There is also one movement, the shared southbound through
and right-turn, operating at LOS F in the PM peak period in the Combined (2015) conditions.
This movement operates at LOS E in the PM peak period in the Background (2015)
conditions. Additionally, all movements on the northbound approach operate at LOS F in
both the AM and PM peak periods in the Combined (2015) conditions. These movements
operate at LOS C in both the AM and PM peak periods in the Background (2015) conditions.
All of these movements require mitigation based on the Town's APFO. Several geometric

                                                                                          FINAL


   improvements were considered, such as exclusive turn lanes, but they did not provide the
   necessary improvement in delay. Therefore, due to the increase in delay for a movement
   operating at LOS F and the degradation of several movements to LOS F, an evaluation of
   peak hour signal warrants was performed and is included in Appendix I. The peak hour
   signal warrant evaluation indicates this intersection will meet peak hour warrants in the
   Combined (2015) scenario. According to the Town of Cary, a signal warrant analysis has
   recently been performed and agreed upon by NCDOT. Based on this and the APFO
   requirements, a signal is required to be installed at the intersection of Carpenter Fire Station
   Road and Cary Glen Boulevard as mitigation for site traffic. This intersection was analyzed
   as a two-phase signalized intersection in the Combined Improved conditions, which resulted
   in overall LOS A operations with all movements operating at LOS A in the AM and PM peak
   periods.

   A summary of the intersection levels of service with mitigation is found in Tables 8a and 8b
   below.

  4.5.       Conclusions
  Table 9a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the 2015 Background, 2015
  Combined, and 2015 Combined and Improved conditions and shows that both intersections
  need no mitigation to meet the APFO requirements. Table 9b provides a comparison of the
  unsignalized intersections in the 2015 Background, 2015 Combined, and 2015 Combined and
  Improved conditions. As indicated in Table 9b without mitigation, the Carpenter Fire Station
  Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection does not meet the APFO requirements. With the
  provision of a signal, the Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection
  operates at an overall LOS A and all movements operate at LOS A in the AM and PM peak
  periods. This is an improvement compared to 2015 Background and 2015 Combined
  conditions and satisfies the requirements of the Town of Cary's APFO. Table 9b also shows
  that the two proposed access driveways meet the APFO requirements in the 2015 Combined
  conditions and do not require mitigation. The proposed build laneage in 2015 for the
  proposed apartments is shown on Figure 10.

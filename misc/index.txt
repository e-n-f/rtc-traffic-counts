Subject:      Memorandum 4.2: Existing Conditions Traffic Operations 
 

This  memorandum  describes  the  existing  traffic  conditions  and  safety  analyses  for  Phase  3  of  the 
OR  126  Expressway  Management  Plan  (EMP).  Future  memoranda  will  address  year  2031  no
build  conditions  as  well  as  an  analysis  of  potential  "build"  alternatives.  This  memorandum 
addresses  Task  4.2  of  the  project  scope,  and  reviews  traffic  conditions  at  and  between  52nd  Street 
and  Main  Street  (Business  126)  in  Springfield,  Oregon.  The  information  presented  in  this 
memorandum  shall  supersede  existing  conditions  information  developed  in  Phase  1  of  the  EMP; 
the previous information should now be considered outdated. 


Introduction
OR  126  is  classified  in  the  Oregon  Highway  Plan  as  a  Statewide  Highway,  an Expressway, a bypass, 
and a designated freight route. The study area for the EMP contains the roadway section between 
I5  and  Main  Street  (Business  126).  Phase  3  of  the  project  focuses  only  on  the  eastern  segment  of 
the corridor, specifically, the 52nd and Main Street intersections. 

Within  the  study  area,  the  highway  has  two  distinct  sections  in  terms  of  design  and  character. 
The  western  portion  (I5  to  42nd  Street)  is  a  gradeseparated  and  accesscontrolled  fourlane 
divided  facility.  The  eastern  section  (52nd  Street  to  Main  StreetOR  126  Business)  is  an  access
controlled  facility  with  atgrade  signalized  intersections  at  52nd  Street  and  Main  Street.  The 
location  of  existing  roadway  facilities  within  close  proximity  to  these  intersections  along  OR  126 
are illustrated in Figure 1.  

The remainder of this memorandum documents the existing traffic volumes and operations and a 
roadway safety review.

December 11, 2008                                                                                          Page 3




Existing Conditions
The  OR  126  study  area  is  located  within  the  City  of  Springfield  Urban  Growth  Boundary.  The 
study  segment  is  bordered  by  residential  and  commercial  uses.  A  parkandride  transit  facility 
operated  by  the  Lane  Transit  District  is  located  in  the  southeast  quadrant  of  the  OR  126/Main 
Street  intersection,  Thurston  High  School  is  located  northeast  of  the  OR  126/Main  Street 
intersection  (east  of  58th  Street),  and  a  Bonneville  Power  Administration  (BPA)  transmission  line 
crosses the OR 126 corridor along the west side of the OR 126/Main Street intersection. 


Geometric Configurations

Lane  configurations  and  posted  speeds  were  reviewed  along  the  study  area  roadways  to  identify 
any  changes  or  improvements  completed  since  the  initial  EMP  Phase  1  work  efforts  in  2004.  The 
only  noted  change  to  the  study  area  was  the  extension  of  the  Bob  Straub  Parkway,  the  southern 
leg  of  the  OR  126/Main  Street  intersection.  While  the  connection  had  been  in  place  at  the  OR 
126/Main  Street  intersection  during  the  previous  efforts,  the  roadway  has  now  been  extended 
through  Daisy  Street  south  to  S  57th  Street,  providing  access  to  and  from  the  adjacent 
neighborhoods.  The  Bob  Straub  Parkway  contains  a  fivelane  crosssection  with  bicycle  lanes, 
detached sidewalks, and illumination. The roadway is accesscontrolled with a landscaped center 
median  and  leftturn  bays  at  public  intersections.  No  other  significant  improvements  were 
identified  that  impact  the  study  area  intersections.  Figure  2  illustrates  the  existing  geometric  lane 
configurations and traffic control devices throughout the study area. 


Existing Access Management

As  identified  in  the  Oregon  Highway  Plan  (OHP),  minimum  spacing  standards  for  OR  126  (a 
Statewide  Highway  and  Expressway)  are  2,640  feet,  measured  centerline  to  centerline.  Along 
Business  126  (also  a  Statewide  Highway  with  a  posted  speed  of  40  mph)  the  minimum  access 
spacing standard is 770 feet.  

The  spacing  between  OR  126/Main  StreetBob  Straub  Parkway  is  1,050  feet  and  contains  two 
driveways.  A  twoway  center  leftturn  lane  divides  eastbound  and  westbound  traffic  along 
Business 126 (Main Street), allowing fullaccess movements at both driveways. 

Between  OR  126/Main  StreetBob  Straub  Parkway  and  OR  126/58th  Street  is  also  1,050  feet  and 
contains  seven  driveways.  A  raised  median  is  in  place  between  OR  126/Main  Street  and  OR 
126/58th Street, restricting access along the segment.  

With  the  number  of  access  points  currently  in  place,  access  management  standards  are  not  met 
within the study area.

Design Hour Traffic Volume Derivation

The  analysis  of  existing  conditions  was  conducted  by  factoring  the  raw  count  data  to  obtain  the 
30th  highest  hour  design  hour  traffic  volumes.  The  derivation  of  the  traffic  volumes  includes 
review of the manual traffic counts to identify data anomalies and errors, seasonal adjustments to 
account  for  variations  in  traffic  flow  by  time  of  year,  and  balancing  between  intersections  to 
account  for  data  imprecision.  This  section  details  the  existing  conditions  design  hour  traffic 
volume development.  


Data Collection Efforts 

All  of  the  data  collection  efforts  throughout  the  study  area  were  conducted  on  May  20,  2008  to 
ensure  proper  balancing  between  intersections  and driveways. The traffic counts were conducted 
in  May  to  account  for  school  traffic  associated with Thurston High School, which is located along 
NE 58th Street near the OR 126/Main Street intersection. Attachment "A" includes a detailed summary 
of the data collection efforts and contains the raw traffic data. 


Design Hour Identification 

Development  of  the  existing  traffic  volumes  followed  a  multistep  process.  Sixteenhour  traffic 
counts  were  conducted  between  4:00  a.m.  and  10:00  p.m.  at  the  key  study  intersections  of  OR 
126/Main  Street  and  OR  126/52nd  Street.  Review  of  the  count  data  in  15minute  increments  was 
used  to  identify  the  peak  analysis  hour  on  a  total  entering  vehicle  (TEV)  basis.  Traffic  volume 
profiles  for  the  two  intersections  are  shown  in  Chart  1.  As  illustrated  in  Chart  1,  the  data  shows 
that  the  study  area  contains  two  distinct  peaks;  one  in  the  morning  between  7:15  and  8:15  a.m. 
and another during the evening commute period between 4:45 and 5:45 p.m.  

Following the morning peak hour, traffic volumes decline until 9:00 a.m., then rise throughout the 
day  until  the  evening  commute  peak.  Traffic  volumes  measured  at  the  intersections  during  the 
weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  are  approximately  20  percent  higher  than  those  during  the  weekday 
a.m. peak hour, representing the critical analysis period. Traffic volumes in the study area decline 
rapidly following the evening peak hour. 

Following  identification  of  the  4:45  to  5:45  p.m.  analysis  period,  the  traffic  counts  were  reviewed 
on an individual and systemwide basis to identify potential data anomalies. As the traffic counts 
were  collected  during  a  single  day  in  May  and  were  collected  at  all  of  the  intersections  and 
driveways throughout the study area, the counts were checked for consistency along the corridor. 
Review  of  the  raw  data  showed  no  significant  volume  disparities  between  any  of  the  traffic 
counts.

Traffic  volumes  were  then  balanced  throughout  the  corridor  to  correct  for  minor  count 
synchronization and data collection errors. The traffic counts were balanced from locations with a 
higher expected degree of accuracy in consideration of individual intersection signal phasing and 
rightturn treatments.  


Seasonal Adjustments 

The balanced and rounded traffic volumes were factored from the May 20, 2008 counts to the 30th 
highest hour design volumes using seasonal adjustment factors. Data for the seasonal adjustment 
factors  were  obtained  using  the  Commuter  roadway  classification  within  ODOT's  Seasonal  Trend 
Tables  to  characterize  the  OR  126  corridor.  As  identified  from  the  tables,  an  adjustment  factor  of 
3.1  percent  was  applied  to  the  traffic  volumes  to  reflect  peak  summertime  conditions.  All  traffic 
volumes  were  rounded  to  the  nearest  five  vehicles  to  better  represent  the  data  collection 
imprecision  and  daily  traffic  variability.  Figure  3  illustrates  the  resultant  30th  highest  design  hour 
traffic volumes. Attachment "B" includes a summary of the seasonal adjustment procedure.

  Saturation Flow Rates

  Saturation  flow  rates  are  defined  as  the  maximum  rate,  expressed  as  vehicles  per  hour  per  lane 
  green (VPHPLG), at which vehicles can discharge through an intersection assuming a solid green 
  signal  indication.  Saturation  flow  rates  can  vary  widely  based  on  the  area  type,  relative 
  congestion,  geometric  configuration,  and  other  sitespecific  factors.  While  standardized  default 
  saturation  flow  rates  are  widely  used  to  assess  traffic  operations,  saturation  flow  rate 
  measurements  were  obtained  at  both  key  intersections  along  the  OR  126  corridor  to  more 
  accurately  assess  the  current  operations.  These  measured  rates  account  for  upstream  roadway 
  characteristics  that  are  affecting  how  traffic  flows  at  the  study  area  intersections.  Measured 
  saturation flow rates resulted in the values summarized in Table 1. Attachment "C" summarizes the 
  saturation flow rate calculation methodology.

  VPHPLG: Vehicles per hour per lane green


  For  intersections  where  saturation  flow  rates  were  not  measured,  an  ideal  saturation  flow  rate  of 
  1,900 vehicles per hour per lane green was applied.  


  Signal Timing

  There  are  four  signalized  intersections  within  the  study  area;  OR  126/52nd  Street,  OR  126/Main 
  Street,  OR  126/58th  Street,  and  Main  Street/54th  Street.  While  under  the  jurisdiction  of  ODOT, 
  signal  timing  at  all  of  the  signalized  intersections  are  maintained  by  the  City  of  Springfield. 
  Current  signal  timing  plans  were  obtained  from  the  City  for  each  of  these  intersections  to 
  replicate existing traffic conditions in the analysis models. 

  As identified in the signal timing plans, all of the study intersections operate in an uncoordinated 
  mode  throughout  the  day  with  no  fixed  cycle  length.  All  of  the  study  intersections  operate  with 
  protected  leftturn  phasing  along  the  major  routes  with  protected  or  permissive  signal  phasing 
  along the minor streets, depending on the traffic volumes.  

  At  the  intersection  of  OR  126/Main  Street  the  traffic  signal  operates  with  split  phasing  to 
  accommodate  the  heavy  southbound  to  eastbound  movements  for  through  traffic  along  OR  126.

Additionally,  westbound  and  southbound  right  turns  are  channelized  maneuvers  that  operate 
separate from the signalized intersection as yieldcontrolled or merge/diverge maneuvers. 

Review  of  the  existing  signal  timing  plans  identified  deficiencies  related  to  pedestrian  walk  and 
flashing  don't  walk  times.  These  signal  timing  parameters  were  modified  within  the  existing 
conditions analysis to reflect minimum times needed to ensure pedestrian safety. 


Analysis Methodology
Operational  analysis  models  were  constructed  for  the  study  area  based  on  the  30th  highest  hour 
traffic  volumes,  GIS  base  map  information,  the  site  inventory,  and  signal  timing  information 
obtained  from  the  City  of  Springfield.  This  model  was  used  to  assess  existing  traffic  operations 
and  queuing  within  the  study  area.  A  peak  hour  factor  was  used  throughout  the  analysis  to 
replicate traffic operations and queuing during the peak 15 minutes of the peak hour.  

In addition to volumetocapacity ratios, levelofservice, and delay, intersection queuing was also 
reviewed  to  determine  whether  vehicular  queues  extend  beyond  the  available  storage  bays  or 
require  more  than  a  single  signal  cycle  to  clear.  The  queuing  analysis  was  completed  using 
SimTraffic  software  averaging  multiple  model  runs,  as  outlined  in  the  July  10,  2008  Analysis 
Procedures memorandum (included as Attachment "D").  

Performance Measures

The  OHP  and  subsequent  OHP  amendments  outline  specific  performance  measures  to  be 
maintained  along  ODOT  facilities.  These  standards  are  aimed  at  maintaining  mobility  along 
important  roadway  corridors  and  vary  according  to  functional  classification,  location,  and  role 
within  the  National  Highway  System  (NHS).  Applicable  intersection  performance  measures  for 
facilities within this study are summarized in Table 21.

  Traffic Operations Analysis

  The  existing  intersection  operational  conditions  were  evaluated  using  Synchro  analysis  software. 
  Detailed  review  of  the  OR  126  segment  and  intersection  operations  are  presented  below,  as  well 
  as  an  overview  of  the  adjacent  public  intersections  and  driveways  throughout  the  study  area.  A 
  summary of the intersection operations is presented in Figure 3.  


  OR 126 Corridor Analysis 

  Weekday  p.m.  peak  hour  volumetocapacity  ratios  were  calculated  for  the  OR  126  and  Business 
  126 roadway segments based on the methodologies outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual. A 
  summary of the existing segment volumes and capacity are provided in Table 3.

December 11, 2008                                                                                        Page 11


As shown in the table, the OR 126 corridor currently meets OHP volumetocapacity standards of 
0.80. Corridor volumes along this segment show a 13 percent increase from the 2004 traffic counts 
in the eastbound direction and a five percent increase westbound. 


OR 126/52nd Street and Adjacent Intersections 

Both  a  field  review  and  the  results  of the operational analyses confirm that the OR 126/52nd Street 
intersection  is  currently  experiencing  long  queues  during  peak  periods,  especially  on  the 
eastbound  leftturn  movement.  This  intersection  currently  operates  at  a  volumetocapacity  ratio 
of 0.74, meeting OHP standards. The adjacent intersections along 52nd Street and Highbanks Road 
that were analyzed operate acceptably.  


OR 126/Main Street and Adjacent Intersection 

The  OR  126/Main  Street  intersection  is  a  signalized  atgrade  intersection,  forming  the  connection 
between  OR  126  and  Business  126.  Eastbound  and  westbound  drivers  on  OR  126  are  required  to 
turn  at  the  intersection  to  remain  on  the  highway.  Accordingly,  no  route  continuity  is  currently 
provided  along  OR  126  between  the  Business  and  expressway  segments,  as  drivers  are  required 
to  turn  to  stay  on  the  higherorder  facility.  The  westbound  and  southbound  rightturns  are 
channelized  freeflow  maneuvers  and  are  not  operated  through  the  traffic  signal.  Given  the 
existing  imbalance  between  traffic  volumes  on  the  northbound  and  southbound  approaches,  the 
intersection  operates  with  split  phasing  in  the  northsouth  direction  and  protected  phasing  east
west.  

As  shown  in  Figure  3,  the  OR  126/Main  Street  intersection  operates  with  a  volume  to  capacity 
ratio  of  0.79  during  peak  periods,  narrowly  meeting  ODOT  mobility  standards  (volumeto
capacity  ratio  less  than  0.80).  Although  long  queues  occur  on  the  southbound  (i.e.,  OR  126)  and 
eastbound  (Main  Street)  approaches,  these  queues  can  generally  be  accommodated  within  the 
existing storage bays. 

The  Bob  Straub  Parkway,  which  comprises  the  southern  intersection  approach  is  a  Lane  County 
facility  that  currently  terminates  at  South  75th  Street,  approximately  a  half  mile  south  of  the  OR 
126/Main  Street  intersection.  There  are  plans  to  extend  the  Bob  Straub  Parkway  to  provide  a 
connection between Main Street and Jasper Road to the south to accommodate planned growth in 
the  JasperNatron  area.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  the  study  intersections  along  the  Bob  Straub 
Parkway  south  of  Main  Street  currently  operate  acceptably  with  the  low  levels  of  development 
density that currently exist. 


Business 126/54th Street and Adjacent Private Driveways 
The  Business  126/54th  Street  intersection  is  approximately  400  feet  west  of  the  merge  point  from 
the  southbound  rightturn  movement  at  the  OR  126/Main  Street  intersection.  This  short  distance 
can  cause  weaving  issues  for  southbound  OR  126  drivers  merging  in  the  outside  travel  lane  and 
destined for the retail uses on the south side of Main Street. No median is currently in place along

Business 126, with eastbound and westbound traffic separated by a twoway center leftturn lane. 
With  the  twoway  center  leftturn  lane,  all  of  the  private  driveways  allow  full  turning 
movements,  some  of  which  become  blocked  by  opposing  queues  during  portions  of  the  signal 
cycles. 

The  Main  Street/54th  Street  intersection  currently  operates  acceptably  per  ODOT  mobility 
standards  with  a  volumetocapacity  ratio  of  0.46  during  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  hour.  As  will  be 
discussed  below,  the  queuing  can  generally  be  accommodated  at  the  intersection  during  peak 
periods. 


OR 126/58th Street and Adjacent Private Access Driveways 
A median is in place along OR 126 east of the intersection with Main Street restricting left turns at 
all  private  driveways  east  to  58th  Street.  The  westernmost  entrance  to  the  BiMart  and  Key  Bank 
stores  contains  a  leftin  pocket  within  the  median,  which  provides  backtoback  queue  storage 
with the westbound leftturn onto the Bob Straub Parkway. 

The  restricted  access  along  OR  126  results  in  the  consolidation  of  leftturn  demand  at  the  OR 
126/58th  Street  intersection  associated  with  the  adjacent  retail  uses.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  the 
intersection  currently  exceeds  ODOT  mobility  standards  (volumetocapacity  ratio  less  than  0.80) 
with a volumetocapacity ratio of 0.81. 

Operations  analysis  was  also  completed  for  all  of  the  private  driveways  along  Main  Street  within 
the  study  area.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  all  of  the  driveways  currently  operate  below  capacity  with 
low  critical  movement  delays.  Similar  to  conditions  along  Business  126,  the  driveways  are shown 
to be blocked by vehicular queues during portions of the signal cycles. 

A  summary  of  all  of  the  mainline  and  study  intersection  operations  and  a  comparison  to  the 
applicable performance standards (as shown in Table 2) is provided in Table 4.

*Note: Values at unsignalized intersections reflect the critical (highest delay) movement as defined within the
Highway Capacity Manual 2000, which is typically reflective of stop-controlled minor-street maneuvers. Given the low
minor-street volumes on the private approaches, high delays may be experienced on a per-vehicle basis while
operating at low volume-to-capacity ratios.


Intersection Queuing Analysis
Given  the  high  levels  of  congestion  along  OR  126  and  Main  Street,  a  queuing  analysis  was 
completed  using  microsimulation  to  account  for  the  interaction  between  the  signalized 
intersections, potential queue spillover beyond the storage bays, and queue interactions along the 
Main  Street  center  leftturn  lane.  The  queuing  analysis  was  completed  using  an  averaged  95th 
percentile  queue  length  from  five  simulation  model  runs.  This  queuing  analysis  identifies 
vehicular queue lengths during the 30th highest hour accounting for the existing signal timing and

 BOLD text indicates 95th percentile queues that exceed the available storage.
 1
   Additional storage is available in the center two-way left-turn refuge lane.
 2
   Eastbound through queues beyond 200 feet will block the eastbound right-turn lane; 960 feet is
 available between the OR 126/Main Street and Main Street/54th Street intersections.
 3
   Queues beyond 225 feet will obstruct the westbound right-turn
 4
   Queues beyond 360 feet will obstruct the southbound right-turn lane. Additional storage is available
 in the inside through lane.
 5
   Additional queue storage is available but will block access to the Transit Center.
 6
   Queues beyond 415 feet will block the southbound right-turn merge area.
 7
   Queues beyond 115 feet will extend beyond the northbound right-turn pocket.

As shown in Table 5 and discussed above, forecast 95th percentile queues are shown to exceed the 
available  storage  at  the  OR  126/52nd  Street,  the  OR  126/Main  Street,  and  OR  126/58th  Street 
intersections. Accordingly, while the signalized intersections may have adequate capacity to serve 
the traffic volumes, queue spillover during the peak hours can result in unused available capacity 
at the intersections due to queue blockages and individual signal cycle failures.

ROADWAY SAFETY
Roadway  safety  was  analyzed  based  on  a  review  of  the  ODOT  Safety  Priority  Index  System 
(SPIS)  list  and  crash  records  at  the  signalized  intersections.  This  review  was  used  to  highlight 
potential safety deficiencies in the study area, as detailed below. 

ODOT SPIS
The  ODOT  SPIS  program  categorizes  facilities  on  a  scale  of  1  to  5  (with  1  being  safer  and  5  being 
less  safe),  based  on  the  number  of  recorded  serious  injury  and  fatal  crashes  during  the  most 
recent  threeyear  period  available  (2004  to  2006).  Currently,  OR  126  is  classified  as  a  Category  2 
facility (with category one being best and category five being worst), identified by 1 to 2 fatal and 
serious  injury  crashes  per  five  mile  segment  over  the  2004  to  2006  period.  Main  Street  (Business 
126  and  OR  126)  is  shown  as  a  Category  5  roadway  with  10  or  more  serious  crashes  per  five  mile 
segment.  In  addition,  OR  126/58th  Street  appears  within  the  95th  to  100th  percentile  SPIS 
intersections,  and  OR  126/Main  Street  is  identified  within  the  90th  to  94.99th  percentile  SPIS 
intersections. 

Crash Data Review
Review  of  crash  records  from  the  sixyear  period  between  2002  and  20072  was  completed  to 
identify  potential  crash  patterns  and  existing  safety  deficiencies  along  the  study  segment  of  the 
OR  126  corridor  based  on  the  individual  incidents.  Crash  data  was  obtained  from  the  ODOT 
database  and  includes  all  reported  crashes  (reported  crashes  involving  property  damage 
exceeding $1,500 or resulting in injuries or fatalities).

                  Crashes per million entering vehicles


Intersection  crash  rates  are  typically  reviewed  as  a  crash  rate  per  million  entering  vehicles.  A 
crash  rate  greater  than  1.0  crash  per  million  entering  vehicles  is  indicative  of  potential  geometric 
or  operational  deficiencies.  As  shown  in  Table  6,  all  of  the  intersections  currently  a  crash  rate  less 
than  1.0  crash  per  million  entering  vehicles.  To  further  explore  the  recorded  crashes,  additional 
review  was  conducted  at  the  intersections  to  review  crashes  by  time  of  day,  roadway  surface 
conditions, collision type, collision severity, and other characteristics.

  Year 2007 crash data was not available at the OR 126/58th Street and Main Street/54th Street intersections. Crash
records at these intersections were obtained from January 2002 through December 2006.

Crash Types 

Table  7  summarizes  crashes  by  type  and  year  for  each  of  the  four  signalized  public  intersections 
in  the  study  area.  As  shown  in  Table  7,  all  four  signalized  intersections  had  a  roughly  equivalent 
number  of  reported  crashes  between  2002  and  2007.  The  majority  of  all  collisions  were  rearend 
type  crashes  (54  percent  of  all  reported  crashes),  which  were  likely  the  result  of  congestion  in  the 
corridor.  The  highest  rate  of  rearend  collisions  occurred  at  the  OR  126/Main  Street  intersection. 
Review  of  the  queuing  analysis  shows  that  the  95th  percentile  southbound  queues  at  the  OR 
126/Main  Street  intersection  remain  within  the  tangent  section  of  OR  126.  Main  Street/54th  Street 
and Main Street/58th Street each had two pedestrian crashes within the analysis period.

No  fatalities  were  recorded  at  any  of  the  signalized  intersections  during  the  analysis  period,  and 
the  number  of  noninjury  crashes  is  higher  than  injury  crashes  at  each  of  the  study  intersections. 
The intersection at OR 126/Main Street experienced a higher percentage of injury crashes than the 
other  study  intersections,  with  nearly  half  of  the  injury  crashes  occurring  in  2002.  Excluding  the 
2002  data  and  considering  only  the  most  recent  five  years  of  data,  72  percent  of  the  crashes  were 
classified as noninjury crashes, consistent with the remaining intersections. 


Pavement and Lighting Conditions 

Table  9  shows  the  distribution  of  crashes  according  to  pavement  surface  conditions  and  natural 
lighting  to  identify  crashes  associated  with  the  roadway  and  weather  conditions.  All  of  the  study 
area intersections contain roadway illumination.

Overall,  77  percent  of  crashes  occurred  with  dry  pavement  and  64  percent  of  crashes  occurred 
during  the  day.  The  intersection  of  Main  Street/58th  Street  contained  more  nighttime  crashes  than 
any  other  intersection,  although  at  the  intersection  nighttime  crashes  still  account  for  only  36 
percent of the total. 


Crashes by Time of Day 

Crash  data  by  time  of  day  at  the  intersections  were  also  further  reviewed  in  an  effort  to  identify 
crash patterns. The results from this analysis are summarized in Chart 2.

Typical  graphs  of  crash  data  over  time  of  day  display  significant  peaking  through  the  evening 
peak  hour,  with  a  rise  in  crashes  starting  at  approximately  1:00  p.m.,  peaking  around  4:00  p.m., 
and  stabilizing  at  7:00  p.m.  Both  the  overall  crash  trend  and  the  individual  graph  for  each 
intersection resembled this pattern, which follows volume trends and congestion in the area. 


Intersection Safety Conclusions

Reported  crashes  at  the  signalized  intersections  are  primarily  rearend  collisions  that  occur 
during  daylight  hours  under  dry  roadway  conditions.  The  high  incidence  of  rearend  crashes  are 
typical  of signalized intersections, and are likely due in part to congestion given that the majority

occur  during  the  evening  peak  hour.  Review  of  the  crash  data  by  type,  roadway  conditions, 
illumination,  and  time  of  day  did  not  identify  any  specific  trends  or  safety  deficiencies. 
Intersection crash records are included in Attachment "G". 


CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS

As  summarized,  intersections  along  the  OR  126  corridor  operate  near  or  beyond  ODOT  mobility 
standards  with  vehicular  queues  exceeding  the  available  storage  at  a  number  of  locations. 
Limited  access  management  strategies  are  currently  employed  along  OR  126  (Main  Street)  east  of 
the Bob Straub Parkway, with little or no access control along Business 126 to the west. A detailed 
safety  review  identified  no  discernable  patterns  at  any  of  the  signalized  intersections,  with  the 
highest number of crashes related to rearend collisions. 

Next  steps  will  be  to  assess future year 2031 nobuild conditions at the study intersections so that 
a  comparison  can  be  provided  between  the  traffic  operations  and  queuing  if  no  improvements 
other than those that are currently planned and funded are completed within the study area. This 
information  will  be  used  to  inform  the  analysis  of  alternatives  to  address  the  issue  of  future 
congestion in the corridor.

Subject:       Data Collection Needs 
 

As  discussed  in  our  PMT  meeting  on  May  7th,  the  purpose  of  this  memorandum  is  to  summarize 
the  data  collection  needs  for  Oregon  126  EMP  Phase  3  work  efforts.  Per  our  discussions,  the  data 
collection  efforts  represent  a  reduced  scope  of  work  from  that  reflected  in  Task  4  of  the  Phase  3 
contract.  During  the  next  18  months,  the  Phase  3  tasks  will  focus  exclusively  on  the  Main  Street 
and  52nd  Street  study  areas.  For  this  reason,  we  will  limit  our  data  collection  to  those  study  areas 
as  well.  When  Phase  4  of  the  project  commences  (currently  estimated  in  2010  or  later),  we 
anticipate collecting data in the west portion of the corridor at that time.  

As  proposed,  all  of  the  data  collection  efforts  summarized  within  this  memorandum  would  be 
conducted  on  a  single,  consistent  midweek  day  between  May  13  and  May  15,  2008  (to  the  extent 
possible),  so  that  a  snapshot  could  be  obtained  of  the  existing  conditions  without  needing  to 
account for daily traffic variations. These counts would be collected in midMay to account for the 
potential impacts of the nearby schools on daily traffic patterns. 


TRAFFIC COUNTS

To  ensure  that  the  weekday  p.m.  peak  period  is  the  critical  analysis  period,  16hour  manual  full 
classification  turning  movement  counts  (4:00  a.m.  to  8:00  p.m.)  will  be  collected  at  the  following 
locations: 
      ·   Oregon 126/Main Street (including slip lanes) 
      ·   Oregon 126/52nd Street 

To  provide  a  check  on  the  traffic  count  data,  a  mainline  count  will  also  be  conducted  along 
Oregon 126 west of 52nd Street to ensure that the arrival and departure traffic volumes balance.

Full  intersection  manual  turning  movement  counts  are  proposed  at  the  following  public 
intersections  during  the  weekday  evening  peak  period  (4:00  to  6:00  p.m.).  Turning  movement 
only counts (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) are proposed at each of the private access driveways in the vicinity 
of the critical intersections. The proposed locations are shown below.

SATURATION FLOW RATE STUDIES

To  validate  assumptions  regarding  appropriate  saturation  flow  rates,  local  saturation  flow  rates 
will be measured at the following locations: 
    ·    Oregon  126/Main  Street  on  the  southbound  leftturn,  eastbound  and  westbound  through 
         movements.  
    ·    Oregon 126/52nd Street on the eastbound and westbound through movements. 
Saturation  flow  rate  studies  will  be  conducted  by  measuring  critical  followup  headways  of 
vehicles.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Purpose of Study
This report was initiated by a request from Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT)
Region I Operations. The purpose of this report is to identify capacity deficiencies and make
recommendations to improve operations around the Knoxville Center Mall.

Project Background
Traffic data was collected Thursday January 9, 2014 or Thursday January 23, 2014. Traffic
operations were analyzed for unsignalized and signalized intersections. LOS results revealed that
all non-signalized intersections along N. Mall Road and S. Mall Road are operating at a LOS C or
better. No improvements are required. The signalized intersections along Washington Pike and
Millertown Pike are operating at a LOS D or better. Additionally, some individual intersection
movements are experiencing poor volume to capacity ratios (V/C). Operational improvements at
these locations are recommended. An ongoing Ramp Queue Phase 2 Report (TDOT PIN
119733.00) recommends improvements to the Westbound I-640 at Millertown Pike off-ramp and
adjacent intersections to the north including Kinzel Way and Loves Creek Road. These
improvements were incorporated in the proposed capacity analysis.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations were developed for three (3) intersections. Washington Pike at N. Mall Road /
I-640 WB On-Ramp currently operates at an LOS D in the A.M. peak and an LOS B in the P.M.
peak. In the A.M. peak 992 vehicles turn right from southbound Washington Pike to I-640
westbound. This yield control movement has an exclusive lane and a V/C of 1.07. Providing a
southbound free flow right turn lane, improves the A.M. peak V/C to 0.67 and intersection LOS to
an LOS A. Proposed N. Mall Road approach reconfiguration modifies the shared through/left
lane to an exclusive left turn lane. All other movements remain the same. The estimated cost of
improvements is $76,000 (2014 dollars).

Washington Pike at S. Mall Road / I-640 EB Off-Ramp intersection currently operates at an LOS
B for both A.M. and P.M. peaks. In the P.M. peak, the I-640 off-ramp through movement and left
turn movement both have a V/C of 0.79. Providing two (2) lanes for both the left and through
movements from I-640 EB Off-Ramp improves P.M. peak through movement V/C to 0.51 and left
turn V/C to 0.70. Reducing the southbound ramp V/C ratios provides additional green time to be
allocated along Washington Pike. This will improve signal coordination. Additionally, a 45% P.M.
queue reduction is provided for the I-640 eastbound off-ramp left and through movements.
Intersection LOS would remain the same. The estimated cost of improvements is $462,000
(2014 dollars).

Millertown Pike at S. Mall Road / I-640 EB On-Ramp intersection currently operates at an LOS B
for both A.M. and P.M. peaks. The left turn movement from southbound Millertown Pike to I-640
westbound on-ramp has an A.M. peak V/C of 0.81. Additionally, the left turn movement from S.
Mall Road has a P.M. peak V/C of 0.83. Reconfiguring the S. Mall Road approach to provide an
exclusive left turn lane, shared through/left turn lane and exclusive right turn lane results in a
southbound A.M. peak V/C of 0.77 and a S. Mall Road left turn movement P.M. peak V/C of
0.76. Reducing the S. Mall Road V/C ratios provides additional green time to be allocated along
Millertown Pike. This will improve signal coordination. Additionally, a 21% P.M. queue reduction
is provided for the S. Mall Road left turn movement. Intersection LOS would remain the same.
The estimated cost of improvements is $33,000 (2014 dollars).

Signal modifications are required at all three (3) intersection locations. All work will occur within
existing right-of-way. Total estimated cost of the recommendations is $571,000 (2014 dollars).

Existing Route Descriptions

I-640 is a six-lane urban interstate that forms a northern loop around Knoxville. It is a full
controlled access facility with a posted speed limit of 55 MPH.

Millertown Pike is a four-lane divided urban minor arterial and transitions to two (2) lanes
south of S. Mall Road and north of Kinzel Way. The City of Knoxville just completed bridge
widening over Love Creek, 5-foot sidewalk along the west side, extending the southbound
through lanes at Kinzel Way and constructing northbound, eastbound and westbound left
turn lanes at Loves Creek Road.

Washington Pike is a four-lane divided urban minor arterial and transitions to two (2) lanes
south of S. Mall Road and intersects Greenway View Drive located approximately 730 feet
north of N. Mall Road.


                                                                                            2

S. Mall Road and N. Mall Road are one-way, two (2) lane local streets, with eastbound
and westbound traffic flow respectively.

Kinzel Way is a two (2) lane local street providing access from Millertown Pike, west to
Knoxville Center Mall and east to Walmart and Buffat Mill Road.

East Towne Road (East) and East Towne Road (West) between N. Mall Road and S. Mall
Road are reverse flow. Left-turning traffic use the rightmost lane to eliminate conflicting
with the through movement traffic at the intersection. The lanes are separated by a
median barrier. East Towne Road (East) is a three (3) lane local street that provides two
(2) lanes traveling from S. Mall Road to N. Mall Road (Inbound to Mall) and one (1) lane
from N. Mall Road to S. Mall Road. East Towne Road (West) is a three (3) lane local
street that provides two (2) lanes traveling from N. Mall Road to S. Mall Road (Outbound
from Mall) and one (1) lane from S. Mall Road to N. Mall Road.

Previous Reports

   ·   In 2001, TDOT produced an Advanced Planning Report (APR) which contained
       recommended improvements within a larger study to review the roadway network
       in the City’s northeast sector surrounding the Knoxville Center Mall.
   ·   In 2009, City of Knoxville produced a Transportation Planning Report (TPR) for the
       Washington Pike/Millertown Pike area. The TPR was prepared in response to a
       City of Knoxville request for an updated APR in the Washington Pike and
       Millertown Pike area.
   ·   TDOT is currently developing an I-640 Westbound Ramp at Millertown Pike Ramp
       Queue Phase 2 Report (TDOT PIN 119733.00). This report is being developed in
       response to a ramp queue impacting I-640 at the westbound off-ramp to Millertown
       Pike.

Summary of Original Proposed Projects

The 2009 TPR recommended improvements along four (4) roadway sections. Roadway
sections have been located on the 2009 TPR Project Location Map and are described
below.

   ·   Section One proposed reconstructing Millertown Pike as a six-lane facility with
       shoulders/bike lanes, curb and gutter and sidewalks from I-640 to the Norfolk
       Southern Railroad Bridge.

   ·   Section Two proposed reconstructing Washington Pike as a four-lane facility with a
       raised median, curb and gutter, sidewalks and bike lanes from I-640 north to
       Murphy Road.

   ·   Section Three proposed reconstructing Washington Pike as a three-lane facility
       with curb and gutter, sidewalks and bikeways on both sides from I-640 south to
       Millertown Pike.

I-640 Ramps at Millertown Pike and Washington Pike Technical Study
PIN 118551.00



   ·   Section Four proposed reconstructing Millertown Pike as an improved two-lane
       facility with curb and gutter, sidewalks and bike lanes from I-640 south to
       Washington Pike.

The ongoing Ramp Queue Phase 2 Report (TDOT PIN 119733.00) recommends
improvements to the Westbound I-640 at Millertown Pike off-ramp and adjacent
intersections to the north including Kinzel Way and Loves Creek Road. Lengthening the
right turn storage along the I-640 Westbound off-ramp is recommended. As previously
mentioned the City of Knoxville recently completed pavement and bridge widening along
Millertown Pike. Based on the recent construction, restriping only was recommended
along Millertown Pike. Millertown Pike from I-640 westbound off-ramp to Loves Creek
Road was restriped to develop two (2) northbound travel lanes. The additional lane
northbound would terminate as a left turn only at Loves Creek Road. Development of this
additional northbound lane eliminated one (1) southbound left turn lane into Walmart at
Kinzel Way. The existing left turn lanes between Kinzel Way and Loves Creek Road were
also eliminated. Ramp Queue Phase 2 improvement figures are provided in the
Appendix.

Multi-Modal Considerations

The routes within the study area are not on a planned or existing bicycle route in the
Tennessee State Bicycle Plan. Bicycle route signing is not present within the project limits.
The study area is predominately retail and commercial development. The city’s public
transit provider, Knoxville Area Transit (KAT), currently provides transit service to the
Knoxville Center area.

Environmental Considerations

The recommended improvements are not expected to have significant impacts to any
environmentally sensitive areas. Millertown Pike bridges over Love Creek, but no bridge
widening is anticipated. All improvements will occur within existing right-of-way.

CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Vehicular turning movement counts were conducted at the study intersection, between the
hours of 6 and 9 A.M., 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. and 3 and 6 P.M., on Thursday January 9, 2014
or Thursday January 23, 2014. These counts and existing intersection geometric data
were input into Synchro/SimTraffic model to develop A.M. and P.M. capacity analysis for
each intersection based on methods contained in the Highway Capacity Manual.
Intersection turning movement data sheets are provided in the Appendix.

The primary output of the signalized intersection capacity analysis is level of service (LOS).
LOS is a qualitative measure of intersection operations based on control delay per vehicle.
General descriptions of intersection LOS are as follows:

       LOS A – Not more than 10 seconds average control delay per vehicle. Vehicles are
       almost completely unimpeded in their ability to maneuver within the traffic stream.

                                                                                            4
Knox County
I-640 Ramps at Millertown Pike and Washington Pike Technical Study
PIN 118551.00



       The general level of physical and psychological comfort provided to the driver is
       high. Intersection has free flow conditions.

       LOS B – Average control delay per vehicle is 10 to 20 seconds. The ability to
       maneuver within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted. The general level of
       physical and psychological comfort provided to the driver is still high. Reasonably
       free flow operation conditions.

       LOS C – Average control delay per vehicle is 20 to 35 seconds. Freedom to
       maneuver within the traffic stream is noticeably restricted. Driver tension increases
       due to additional vigilance required. Traffic flow speed is at or near free flow speed.

       LOS D – Average control delay per vehicle is 35 to 55 seconds. Maneuvering within
       the traffic stream is noticeably limited. Drivers experience reduced physical and
       psychological comfort.

       LOS E – Average control delay per vehicle is 55 to 80 seconds. The lower end is at
       the theoretical limit of capacity. Operations are severely restricted due to limited
       gaps in traffic stream. Drivers experience physical and psychological discomfort.

       LOS F – Average control delay per vehicle is greater than 80 seconds. The volume
       of traffic entering exceeds the ability of the intersection to accommodate. Drivers
       experience physical and psychological discomfort.

At intersections controlled by stop or yield signs on minor street approach, LOS is
determined by the computed control delay for each minor movement and not for the
intersection as a whole. Levels of Service for the movements are as follows:

                                          Average Control Delay
                Level of Service            (seconds/vehicle)

                       A                          0-10

                       B                         >10-15

                       C                         >15-25

                       D                         >25-35

                       E                         >35-50

                       F                           >50




Study area LOS results revealed that the non-signalized intersections along N. Mall Road
and S. Mall Road are operating at a LOS C or better. No improvements are required. The
signalized intersections along Washington Pike and Millertown Pike are operating at a LOS

D or better and some individual intersection movements are experiencing poor volume to
capacity ratios (V/C). Operational improvements at these locations are recommended.
Ramp Queue Phase 2 Report (TDOT PIN 119733.00) recommendations were also
incorporated in the proposed LOS results. The Ramp Queue Phase 2 improvements have
been previously discussed and are provided on figures in the Appendix. Additional
analyses were performed to determine the LOS delivered by the recommendations. The
LOS results for the existing geometrics and proposed geometrics are provided in the
Appendix.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Washington Pike at N. Mall Road / I-640 WB On-Ramp

This intersection currently operates at an LOS D in the A.M. peak and an LOS B in the
P.M. peak. In the A.M. peak 992 vehicles turn right from southbound Washington Pike to
I-640 westbound. This yield control movement has an exclusive lane and an A.M. peak
V/C of 1.07. The right turn lane length is restricted by a Norfolk Southern railroad bridge
just north of the intersection. Providing a southbound free flow right turn lane, improves
the A.M. peak V/C to 0.67 and intersection LOS to an LOS A. The N. Mall Road approach
currently provides a shared through/left lane, through lane and an exclusive right turn
lane. Proposed N. Mall Road approach reconfiguration modifies the shared through/left
lane to an exclusive left turn lane. All other movements remain the same. Signal
modifications are required. All work will occur within existing right-of-way. The estimated
cost of improvements is $76,000 (2014 dollars). This recommendation is provided on
Figure 2.

Washington Pike at S. Mall Road / I-640 EB Off-Ramp

This intersection currently operates at an LOS B for both A.M. and P.M. peaks. In the
P.M. peak, the I-640 off-ramp through movement and left turn movement both have a V/C
of 0.79. These movements currently have an exclusive lane and share an additional lane.
Constructing a second left turn lane would provide two (2) lanes for each movement. This
improves P.M. peak through movement V/C to 0.51 and left turn V/C to 0.70. Reducing
the southbound ramp V/C ratios provides additional green time to be allocated along
Washington Pike. This will improve signal coordination. Additionally, a 45% P.M. queue
reduction is provided for the I-640 eastbound off-ramp left and through movements.
Intersection LOS would remain the same. Signal modifications are required. All work will
occur within existing right-of-way. The estimated cost of improvements is $462,000 (2014
dollars). This recommendation is provided on Figure 3.

Millertown Pike at S. Mall Road / I-640 EB On-Ramp

This intersection currently operates at an LOS B for both A.M. and P.M. peaks. The left
turn movement from southbound Millertown Pike to I-640 westbound on-ramp has an A.M.
peak V/C of 0.81. Additionally, the left turn movement from S. Mall Road has a P.M. peak
V/C of 0.83. Reconfiguring the S. Mall Road approach to provide an exclusive left turn
lane, through/left turn lane and exclusive right turn lane results in a southbound A.M. peak
V/C of 0.77 and a S. Mall Road left turn movement P.M. peak V/C of 0.76. Reducing the

                                                                                          6

S. Mall Road V/C ratios provides additional green time to be allocated along Millertown
Pike. This will improve signal coordination. Additionally, a 21% P.M. queue reduction is
provided for the S. Mall Road left turn movement. Intersection LOS would remain the
same. Signal modifications are required. All work will occur within existing right-of-way.
The estimated cost of improvements is $33,000 (2014 dollars). This recommendation is
provided on Figure 4.

Total estimated cost of the recommendations is $571,000 (2014 dollars).

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIAR) for the Waikapu Country
Town Project (the Project).

The Project. The Project is a mixed use neighborhood development on mostly undeveloped land south of
Waiko Road in the Waikapu community in Central Maui. It is located on both the mauka and makai side
of Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30).

The Project will be developed in two phases: 2017 through 2021 is the first phase, and the second phase
will be from 2022 through 2026. Figure A in this Executive Summary depicts the proposed land use plan
and street network for the Project, and more detail is provided in Figures 2 and 10 in the report.

Two Phases. The first phase is to be developed as a “Village Center” on the mauka side of Honoapiilani
Highway and will contain approximately 170,000 square feet of commercial and employment uses, as well
as 731 residential units, an elementary school and 27 acres of park and open space. Phase 2 will include:
848 residential units and approximately 6 acres of park and open space.           Primary access would be
provided via Honoapiilani Highway and Waiale Road, via the planned southward extension of Waiale Road
known as the Waiale Bypass. Much of the right-of-way necessary to construct the Waiale Bypass lies
within the Project site.

Project Site Plan.   The proposed site plan provides an extensive internal roadway system which will
provide community residents and visitors multiple options for accessing neighborhoods, employment
centers, commercial areas, and institutional uses. The Project embodies Country Town Design principles
that include a country sense of place with a mix of uses, and fosters walkability and connectivity through
pedestrian/bicycle routing, with bridges and approximately 8 miles of hiking, biking, and walking trails.
These characteristics promote the use of non-motorized modes, especially for short commutes, and help
to reduce external vehicle trip generation.

Study Methodology. The study first forecasts traffic volumes based without the development of the
Project, and then forecasts volumes with the development of each phase of the Project. It documents
estimated traffic movements at the analyzed intersections and determines volume-to-capacity (V/C)
ratios, average delay times and the resulting level of service (LOS) ratings. This study recommends
specific mitigation measures to address locations where undesirable levels of service are projected. The
project site plan and study area are depicted in Figure A in this Executive Summary.

Vehicle Trip Generation. The first phase of the Project is estimated to generate approximately 13,100
week day daily trips including approximately 700 trips during the weekday morning peak hour and 1,000
trips during the weekday afternoon peak hour. At the end of the second phase, the Project would
                                                                                                        4

generate a total of approximately 19,000 weekday trips including approximately 1,200 trips in the
weekday AM peak hour and 1,500 trips in the weekday PM peak hour.

Intersection Analysis. The traffic impact analysis was evaluated pursuant to guidelines established by the
County of Maui and the Hawaii Department of Transportation-Highways Division-Planning Branch.
Weekday $0 and 30 peak hour capacity analysis was conducted for eight (8) existing and six (6) future
intersections in the vicinity of the Project site. Under the current baseline 2013 conditions, seven (7) of
the eight (8) existing intersections are operating at the desired LOS of D or better during the weekday
peak hours. The existing intersection LOS analysis is presented in Table 3 of the report.

Future Conditions without Project. The future intersection operating conditions will be significantly
affected by regional growth and development in the study area before project implementation. By 2022
and 2026 the Project area will have experienced significant residential and commercial growth and due to
the development of neighboring projects including Waiale, Maui Lani Development, Kehalani
Development, Puunani residences, and other developments as outlined in Table 4.              Future regional
development will be accompanied by roadway network changes will improve mobility options for
residents and visitors, as well as expand roadway capacity at various locations within the study area.
Nevertheless, with this growth, five (5) of the 14 study intersections are projected to operate at an
undesirable LOS E or F during one or both peak hours in each future year.

Project Traffic Impact. The traffic analysis addressed the completion of the first phase (2022) and the
second phase (2026) with the Project. Following development of both the first phase and second phase of
the Project, six (6) of the fourteen (14) intersections studied (Intersection 1-4 and 7-8) would operate at
LOS (E) or (F) in either the AM and/or PM peak hour. As noted above, all but one of these six intersections
(Intersection 8) are projected to operate at undesirable levels without the addition of project traffic. Eight
(8) of the study intersections (Intersections 5-6 and 9-14) are projected to operate at acceptable LOS with
buildout of the project and will not require mitigation strategies. See Tables 6 and 7.

Mitigation Strategies. Mitigation strategies were developed to identify recommended improvements at
the intersections with projected overall intersection levels of service, LOS (E) or LOS (F) in the years 2022
and 2026.    Each of the identified project-related and cumulative impacts would be fully mitigated
(achieving LOS D or better for intersection operations) with recommended improvements as described in
Chapter 5 and Appendix F of the TIAR.            In some cases, certain individual turning movements or
approaches would continue to operate at LOS (E) or (F), even with overall intersection mitigation.
However, further mitigation measures to address specific turning movement or approach operations are
not recommended because they do not meet typical traffic engineering guidelines or would result in
atypical improvements (i.e., triple left-turn lanes) that could have significant right-of-way impacts or
change community character. The estimated share of traffic mitigation cost shown on Table 8 was
calculated      for   proposed     mitigations     under     Year    2026     with     project    conditions.

Waikapu Country Town TIAR
December 2014



2. INTRODUCTION

This transportation impact analysis report (TIAR) presents the results of the study conducted by Fehr &
Peers for the proposed Waikapu Country Town Project (hereafter “WCT” or “Project”) located in the area
of south Waikapu in Central Maui, which is approximately two miles south of Wailuku. The purpose of this
analysis is to identify the impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding transportation system. The
TIAR includes a description of the assumptions and methods used to conduct the study, as well as a
discussion of the results. This TIAR was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the affected
government agencies.



PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project would construct a new mixed-use neighborhood on approximately 500 acres of mostly
undeveloped land south of Waiko Road on both the mauka and makai side of Honoapiilani Highway
(Highway 30). The proposed development site lies within the County’s adopted urban growth boundary
and is part of larger property that totals approximately 1,562 acres. The area outside of the proposed WCT
site will remain in agricultural use within the State’s Agricultural District. Figure 1 illustrates the study area
of the proposed project.

WCT will be built in two phases through 2026 and the proposed land use plan and street network for the
project is illustrated on Figure 2. The “village center” type development on the mauka side of
Honoapiilani Highway is proposed to be constructed in the first phase, 2017 through 2021. Phase 1 also
includes the development of residential parcels directly north and northwest of the “village center,” as well
as the northern half of the project site on the makai side of Honoapiilani Highway. Phase 1 is programmed
as follows:

    •   332 single-family dwelling units;
    •   15 rural residential units;
    •   216 mixed-use multi-family dwelling units;
    •   41 “ohana” units;
    •   127 country town mixed-use residential units;
    •   58,475 square feet of country town mixed-use commercial;
    •   111,122 square feet of new commercial and employment;
    •   an elementary school (12 acres); and
    •   26.66 acres of parks and open space.

Additionally, it is assumed that the 29,250 square feet of existing commercial uses located in the same
area as the “village center” will remain.

Phase 2 of the development program, 2022-2026, will construct the remainder of the project and includes:

     •    638 single-family dwelling units;
     •    65 rural residential units;
     •    40 multi-family dwelling units;
     •    105 “ohana” units; and
     •    5.78 acres of parks and open space.

Primary access would be provided via Honoapiilani Highway and Waiale Road via the planned southward
extension of Waiale Road, known as the Waiale Bypass.

PROJECT STUDY AREA

The study analyzed the potential project-related traffic impacts under typical weekday AM and PM peak
hour traffic conditions at partial buildout in 2022 and at full buildout in 2026. The transportation analysis
evaluated the operations at eight existing and six future intersections (a total of 14 study intersections) in
the vicinity of the proposed project. The analyzed intersections are listed below and are shown in Figure

INTERSECTION ANALYSIS SCENARIOS

The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the weekday morning and evening peak
hours for the following scenarios:

    •     Scenario 1: Existing (2013) Conditions – The analysis of existing traffic conditions was based on
          2013 counts collected for analyzed peak hours. The existing conditions analysis includes a
          description of key area streets and highways, and an assessment of traffic volumes and
          intersection operating conditions.

    •     Scenario 2: Year 2022 No Project Conditions – Future Year 2022 volumes were projected using the
          Maui Travel Demand Forecasting Model (TDFM). Traffic from approved but not yet constructed
          (and possibly pending) developments in the area were also be added to this scenario. Although
          the anticipated completion year of the first phase of the WCT development is 2021, the Phase 1
          traffic impact analysis was conducted for 2022 to be consistent with the planned completion of
          large background projects in the area, such as the Waiale development and the Waiale Bypass,
          and to provide a conservative analysis.
    •     Scenario 3: Year 2022 with Partial Development Conditions – Traffic projections from Scenario 2
          plus traffic estimates from the first phase of project development.
    •     Scenario 4: Year 2026 No Project Conditions – Future volumes in the anticipated year of project
          buildout and full occupancy were projected using the Maui TDFM. Traffic from approved and
          pending developments in the area not included in Scenario 2 is added in this scenario.
    •     Scenario 5: Year 2026 with Project Conditions – Traffic projections from Scenario 4 plus traffic
          estimates anticipated from project buildout and full occupancy.



TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METHODS

The analysis of roadway operations performed for this study is based on procedures presented in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), published by the Transportation Research Board in 2000. Although the
2010 HCM was available at the time this report was published; not many jurisdictions have yet adopted
the 2010 HCM, as many LOS software programs are still fine tuning versions incorporating updated 2010
methods. Differences in analysis results for intersection level of service (LOS) evaluation have been found
to be negligible between the 2000 and 2010 HCM and are not expected to change the conclusions of this
report.

The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service. LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six

                                                                                                         11

levels are defined from LOS A, with the least congested operating conditions, to LOS F, with the most
congested operating conditions. LOS E represents “at-capacity” operations. Operations are designated as
LOS F when volumes exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions. The methodologies for
signalized and unsignalized intersections are described below.


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

The method described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual was used to prepare the LOS
calculations for the signalized study intersections. This LOS method analyzes a signalized intersection’s
operation based on average control delay per vehicle. Control delay includes the initial deceleration delay,
queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized
intersections is calculated using Synchro analysis software and is correlated to a LOS designation as
shown in Table 1.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

The operations of the unsignalized intersections were evaluated using the method contained in Chapter
17 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. LOS ratings for stop-sign-controlled intersections are based on
the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle.                 At two-way or side-street-controlled
intersections, the average control delay is calculated for each stopped movement, not for the intersection
as a whole. For approaches composed of a single lane, the control delay is computed as the average of all
movements in that lane. For approaches with multiple lanes, the control delay is computed for each
movement; the movement with the worst (i.e., longest) delay is presented. The average control delay for
unsignalized intersections is calculated using Synchro analysis software and is correlated to a LOS
designation as shown in Table 2.

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA

The analysis of future conditions compares baseline scenarios with Phase 1 of the project and full buildout
year of the project to determine whether the project traffic is expected to result in a significant impact on
the surrounding roadways. Based on previous studies conducted for the County of Maui, the minimum
acceptable operating standard for a signalized intersection is LOS D for the overall intersection.
Additionally, the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) strives to universally maintain LOS D
conditions and in their HDOT Best Practices for Traffic Impact Report (June 2012) defines a significant
impact when the operations of an intersection, turning movement, or roadway segment changes from
LOS D or better to LOS E or F. Also when evaluating intersection approach LOS at any location, other


                                                                                                              13

factors should be considered in the analysis, such as traffic volumes, volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios
(should ideally be less than 1.00), and secondary impacts to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit travel.

Each of the identified significant impacts could be further categorized as either a cumulative impact or a
project-related impact. If the addition of project traffic is expected to degrade acceptable service levels
(LOS D or better) to unacceptable service levels (LOS E or F) then the project is considered to have a
project-specific impact. Whereas, if the LOS for any roadway element is LOS E or F without the project and
the project adds traffic to this location, causing the delay to increase by 5% or more, then this would be
characterized as a cumulative impact.

For unsignalized intersections, the project is determined to have a significant cumulative impact when it
adds traffic to a study location that includes a controlled approach that operates at an unacceptable level
(i.e., LOS E or F). If the addition of project traffic causes an unsignalized intersection to degrade from LOS
D or better to LOS E or F, then the impact is considered project-specific.

The County of Maui does not publish impact criteria for pedestrian, bicycle, and transit impacts. However,
these impacts are generally evaluated based on whether a proposed project would: 1) conflict with
existing or planned pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities, or 2) create walking, bicycling, or transit use
demand without providing adequate and appropriate facilities for non-motorized mobility. The existing
amenities for pedestrians, bicycles, and transit users were inventoried to evaluate the quality of the
facilities in place today. Planning documents affecting future non-motorized transportation in the study
area, including the draft Federal-Aid Highways 2035 Transportation Plan for the District of Maui, the
Central Maui Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plan for 2030, and the Bike Plan Hawaii, were reviewed to
assess the compatibility of the project with planned future conditions for non-automobile modes.



REPORT ORGANIZATION

The remainder of this report is divided into six chapters, including this Introduction. The existing
transportation system serving the project site and the current operating conditions of the key
intersections are described in Chapter 2 Existing Conditions. Chapter 3 summarizes the methodologies
used to forecast future cumulative and project traffic volumes and the resultant forecasts. Chapter 4
presents an assessment of future traffic impacts at intersections in the surrounding area and identifies
mitigation measures to address both cumulative and project-specific impacts. Chapter 5 contains an
assessment of the potential effect of the project on future transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities and
discusses the project’s site access and circulation. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the conclusions of the
study.

3. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to identify existing transportation conditions in
the vicinity of the proposed project. The assessment of existing conditions relevant to this study includes
an inventory of the street and highway system, traffic volumes on these facilities, and operating conditions
at key intersections. Existing public transit service and bicycle and pedestrian facilities are also described.



EXISTING TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES

This section describes the significant roadway facilities in the study area, as well as the existing transit,
bicycle, and pedestrian facilities.


EXISTING STREET SYSTEM

Primary regional access to the area is provided by Honoapiilani Highway, which traverses directly through
the middle of the project site, and by Kuihelani Highway, which is located east of the project site. The key
roadways providing access to the site are described below. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed project
location and the surrounding roadway system.

Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30) provides regional access around the western side of Maui and links
West Maui with Central Maui.          The roadway is initially classified as a principal arterial in downtown
Wailuku and as it extends south to Waikapu and Maalaea. As the roadway runs through Lahaina in West
Maui, it transitions into a minor arterial. Through the regions of Kapalua and Honolua, it is classified as a
collector roadway, and ends in Honokohau Bay, where it becomes Kahekili Highway. In the project area,
this undivided arterial runs north-south and provides two travel lanes (one in each direction) with separate
lanes for left and right turns at many intersections. Parking is not permitted on most segments of
Honoapiilani Highway, and sidewalks are not provided. The posted speed limit ranges between 30 to 45
miles per hour (mph).


Kuihelani Highway (Highway 380) is a north-south, four-lane divided arterial with a posted speed limit of
45 or 55 mph in the study area. The roadway begins at its intersection with Puunene Avenue and Dairy
Road in Kahului and extends southward until it terminates at its intersection with Honoapiilani Highway
north of Maalaea Harbor.


Waiale Road is a north-south, undivided collector road that starts as an extension of Lower Main Street
and terminates at Waiko Road. The roadway provides two travel lanes (one in each direction) and serves



                                                                                                              15

as the only access road for residents of the Waikapu Gardens neighborhood located between Kuikahi
Drive and Waiko Road. The posted speed limit is 20 mph.

Kuikahi Drive is an east-west, undivided collector road with two travel lanes (one in each direction). West
of its intersection of Honoapiilani Highway, Kuikahi Drive passes through the Wailuku Heights
Development until it terminates at a cul-de-sac. Approximately 1,000 feet east of its intersection with
Honoapiilani Highway, the roadway terminates at its intersection with Waiale Road and Maui Lani
Parkway. The posted speed limit is 20 to 30 mph in the study area.

Kamehameha Avenue is a north-south collector road with two travel lanes (one in each direction).
Kamehameha Avenue begins at its intersection of Hana Highway and extends southward through the
Maui Lani development until it terminates just south of Pomakai Elementary School. In the project study
area, sidewalks are provided along most segments and the posted speed limit is 20 mph.


Maui Lani Parkway is an east-west, divided collector road with two travel lanes (one in each direction) and
a raised median. Maui Lani Parkway begins as the east leg of where Kuikahi Drive intersects with Waiale
Road and extends eastward until it terminates at its intersection with Kuihelani Highway. The posted
speed limit is 20 mph.

Waiko Road is an east-west, undivided collector road with two travel lanes (one in each direction). Waiko
Road begins in a residential neighborhood west of Honoapiilani Highway and traverses through mostly
residential and industrial uses until it terminates when it intersects Kuihelani Parkway. In the project area,
Waiko Road is a narrow, winding 20 to 30 mph road with no sidewalks provided and limited street parking
opportunities.


EXISTING TRANSIT FACILITIES

The Maui Bus service, operated by Roberts Hawaii, provides public transit service around the island with
13 bus routes. Each route operates seven days a week, including holidays.


The Lahaina Islander Route (#20) is the only Maui Bus that serves the Waikapu area, which provides hourly
service between the Wharf Cinema Center in Lahaina, Maia’aea Harbor Village, and Waikapu, before it
originates and terminates at the Queen Ka’ahumanu Center in Kahului. In the study area, this route
operates along Honoapiilani Highway with a bus stop approximately 2,000 feet north of the project site at
the intersection of Honoapiilani Highway and Waiko Road.




                                                                                                           16

EXISTING BICYCLE FACILITIES

Bicycle facilities generally consist of three types of facilities, which are outlined below:

    •   Bike or Shared Use Paths provide a completely separate right-of-way and is designated for the
        exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized.
        Generally, the recommended pavement width for a two-directional shared use path is ten (10)
        feet.




    •   Bike Lanes provide a restricted right-of-way and is designated for the use of bicycles with a
        striped lane on a street or highway. Bicycle lanes are generally five (5) feet wide. Adjacent vehicle
        parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-flow are permitted.




    •   Bike Route or Signed Shared Roadways provide for a right-of-way designated by signs or
        pavement markings for shared use with pedestrians or motor vehicles.




                                                                                                          17

In 2003, the HDOT released the Bike Plan Hawaii to provide a blueprint for integrating bicycle facilities
into the State’s transportation system and enhancing the bicycle environment for its residents and visitors.
Bike Plan Hawaii is the most current document that presents a comprehensive existing bicycle facility
inventory for Maui. The Bike Plan Hawaii (2003) reported the island of Maui has 37.8 miles of bicycle
facilities that are signed shared roads, 21.6 miles of bicycle lanes, and one mile of shared use path.

In March 2012 the State of Hawaii’s Department of Health, Healthy Hawaii Initiative prepared a bicycle
and pedestrian master plan for Central Maui, entitled Central Maui Pedestrian & Bicycle Master Plan for
2030. The report documents existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities within the region, current gaps in
these facilities, and a detailed capital improvements program to significantly increase walking and
bicycling. The Plan’s major recommendations include:

          •     Initiating a comprehensive signage and striping program;
          •     Establishing a “bicycle” district within Kahului that emphasizes separating pedestrians and
                bicyclists from traffic by installing separated cycle/pedestrian tracks along Papa and Wakea
                Avenues and calming traffic along residential streets;
          •     Establishing “pedestrian” districts that emphasizes mixed-use development, wide sidewalks
                and pedestrian amenities within the core commercial districts of Wailuku and Kahului;
          •     Establishing a pedestrian/bicycle esplanade along the Kahului Beach Road; and
          •     Installing a separated pedestrian and bike path along the Waiale Road and Waiale Bypass to
                link Wailuku, Maui Lani, and Waikapu.

The Plan is being used by the County’s Department of Public Works for its pedestrian and bicycle
planning. Under existing conditions, the WCT site comprises of mostly vacant parcels and so there are no
bicycle facilities. However, in the vicinity of the project site and in the greater study area, there are limited
existing bicycle facilities. Honoapiilani Highway is a signed shared road facility that provides access
between Waiale Road and Fleming Beach Park. In the study area, striped bicycle lanes have been
identified along some north and south segments of Honoapiilani Highway. Waiale Road provides a bicycle
facility that provides a ½-mile designated bicycle lane from the start of Waiale Road to the Maui
Correctional Center. Maui Lani Parkway provides a ½-mile bicycle lane from Kamehameha Avenue and
Kuihelani Highway.


EXISTING PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES

Pedestrian facilities consist of sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals at signalized intersections.
Pedestrian facilities do not currently exist within the WCT site and existing pedestrian facilities are limited
in the major roadways that serve the project study area. For example, sidewalks are not provided on either
side of Honoapiilani Highway, Kuihelani Highway, Waiko Road, and Waiale Road, while sidewalks are
provided only on one side of Kuikahi Drive and most portions of Maui Lani Parkway.


                                                                                                              18

Pedestrian facilities at the existing study intersections are described below. Five of the eight existing study
intersections are marked with high visibility crosswalks on at least two of the legs.

    •   Intersection 1: Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30) & Kuikahi Drive
            o    Signalized with marked crosswalks and pedestrian signals on all four legs
    •   Intersection 2: Waiale Road & Kuikahi Drive
            o    Signalized with marked crosswalks and pedestrian signals on all four legs
    •   Intersection 3: S. Kamehameha Avenue/Maui Lani Parkway
            o    All-way stop-controlled with marked crosswalks on three legs
    •   Intersection 4: Kuihelani Parkway (Highway 380) & Maui Lani Parkway
            o Signalized with no marked crosswalks and pedestrian signals at all four legs
    •   Intersection 5: Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30) & Waiko Road
            o    Signalized with marked crosswalks and pedestrian signals on three legs
    •   Intersection 6: Waiale Road & Waiko Road
            o Side-street stop-controlled with no marked crosswalks on all legs
    •   Intersection 8: Kuihelani Highway (Highway 380) & Waiko Road
            o    Signalized with marked crosswalks and pedestrian signals on two legs
    •   Intersection 14: Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30) & Kuihelani Highway (Highway 380)
            o Signalized with no marked crosswalks and pedestrian signals at all four legs


EXISTING INTERSECTION VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS

The operations of the eight existing study intersections were evaluated during weekday morning (6:00 to
9:00 AM) and evening (3:00 to 6:00 PM) peak-period conditions. Traffic counts were collected during the
weekday AM and PM peak periods at the study intersections in September 2013, when local schools were
in session. Existing lane configurations and signal controls were obtained through field observations.
Figure 3 presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes, corresponding lane
configurations and traffic control devices. Traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix A.



EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Existing peak-hour volumes and lane configurations were used to calculate levels of service for each of
the study intersections. The results of the existing LOS analysis are presented in Table 3 and the
corresponding LOS calculation sheets are included in Appendix B.

The results of the LOS calculations indicate that all of the existing study intersections operate at an overall
acceptable service level (LOS D or better), with the exception of the following location:

    •   Intersection 3: S. Kamehameha Avenue & Maui Lani Parkway (LOS E – AM peak hour and LOS F –
        PM peak hour)
            o    The all-way stop-control and high eastbound and westbound volumes traversing through
                 a shared left/through/right configuration contribute to the relatively high eastbound and
                 westbound approach delays and overall poor operating peak levels of service at this
                 intersection.

4. FUTURE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

To evaluate the potential impact of traffic generated by the proposed project on the surrounding street
system, it was necessary to develop estimates of future traffic conditions in the area both with and
without the project. Future traffic conditions without the proposed project reflect traffic increases due to
general regional growth and development, as well as traffic increases generated by other specific
developments near the project site. These conditions are referred to as the cumulative base condition
(i.e., no project conditions). The sum of the cumulative base and project-generated traffic represents the
cumulative plus project conditions. Development of these future traffic scenarios is described in this
chapter.



CUMULATIVE BASE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

The cumulative base traffic projections include two elements: 1) model forecasts of future traffic volumes
that take into account the expected changes in traffic over the existing traffic volumes caused by traffic
generated by specific cumulative projects located in the study area and overall regional growth; and 2) by
roadway network changes and street system improvements.

Although the anticipated completion year of the first phase of the WCT development is 2021, the analysis
used 2022 for the horizon year for Phase 1 to be consistent with the planned completion of large
background projects in the area, such as the Waiale development and the Waiale Bypass, providing a
more conservative cumulative forecast against which to assess potential project impacts.


AREAWIDE TRAFFIC GROWTH AND CUMULATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

Information was obtained from the County of Maui on approved, planned, and proposed development
projects throughout Central Maui. This information was used to estimate future traffic volumes for the
study area, since the growth and changes in traffic caused by anticipated projects in the Kahului, Wailuku
and Waikapu areas could affect conditions on the streets around WCT. Table 4 is a compiled list of future
cumulative projects in the Central Maui vicinity. Appendix C provides a more detailed list with available
project descriptions for residential projects that the County is monitoring, as well as maps of other
residential and non-residential development projects in Central Maui that have come to the attention of
the Department of Planning.

By 2022 and by 2026, the WCT study area will have experienced significant residential growth and
development of new commercial, industrial, business, and institutional land uses, primarily because of the
following projects:

       •   Waiale, located along Waiko Road, south of the Maui Lani development, east of Waiale Road, and
                                                                                       1
           directly west of Kuihelani Highway, is assumed to be completed by 2022. The planned mixed-use
           community will include 2,550 single-family and multi-family dwellings, commercial and light
           industrial land uses, as well as a middle school.
       •   Maui Lani Development is partially complete and assumed to be fully completed by 2026. This
           master planned community along Mauilani Parkway between Waiale Road and Kuihelani
           Highway, comprises of a mixture of residential subdivisions that total approximately 1,000 single-
           family and multi-family households and commercial uses. Specifically, the development includes
           the Maui Lani Village Center, which will be about 540,000 square feet or 79 lots available for
           commercial, business, or medical office uses.
       •   Kehalani Development is partially complete and assumed to be fully completed by 2026. This
           master planned community of 2,400 homes is located north of Kuikahi Drive, south of Iao Valley
                                                                                                    2
           Road, east of the West Maui Mountains, and primarily west of Honoapiilani Highway.
       •   Puunani Residences is located on the southwest quadrant of the intersection of Honoapiilani
           Highway & Kuikahi Drive. It is assumed that 20% and 40% of the project would be completed by
           both 2022 and 2026, respectively. Kuikahi Drive and Honoapiilani Highway are planned to provide
           access to the 600-home neighborhood.

Traffic generated by the above related projects and other developments were projected using the Maui

use and socioeconomic data provided by the County of Maui in 2007 to Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs).
These attributes were further used to generate and assign traffic across the roadway network for the base
and horizon years, respectively.

BASELINE STREET SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

Discussions were held with County and State agency staff regarding the roadway improvements in or near
the study area planned for completion by 2022. These improvements, whether the result of local capital
improvement programs or in connection with planned or approved projects, would result in dramatically
improved mobility options for residents and visitors as well as capacity changes at various locations
throughout the study area as discussed below.

Based on the information received from agency staff, the review of planning documents related to the
nearby projects, and the review of the roadway network changes between the base and horizon year
models, the proposed transportation system changes that are projected to occur between 2007 and 2022
                                                                                                       4
are included in the cumulative base traffic network of each horizon year No Build model.                   The
improvements are listed in detail below:

      •   Hana Highway Widening – The 2020 and 2035 roadway networks of the TDFM includes the
          widening of Hana Highway from a four-lane to a six-lane divided highway from Kaahumanu
          Avenue to the vicinity of the also proposed Kahului Airport Access Road.

      •   Honoapiilani Highway Widening – The 2020 and 2035 roadway networks of the TDFM includes
          the widening of Honoapiilani Highway between Lahainaluna Road and Aholo Road in West Maui
          from being a two-lane roadway to a four-lane roadway.

      •   Kahului Airport Access Road – This four-lane bypass will be constructed from Puunene Avenue to
          Hana Highway. The purpose of this road is to provide an alternative route to congested existing
          routes (i.e., Dairy Road) to Kahului Airport. This roadway improvement project is assumed in the
          2020 and 2035 roadway networks of the TDFM.

      •   Kamehameha Avenue Extension – To support the Waiale development and related traffic, it is
          assumed that Kamehameha Avenue will extend southward from its existing terminus near its
          intersection with Maui Lani Parkway to intersect Waiko Road and eventually to intersect with the
          Waiale project site Road B.

      •   Intersection 7: Kamehameha Avenue & Waiko Road – This future side street stop-controlled, four-
          legged intersection will consist of one left-turn lane and one shared through/right-turn lane on all

    Per HDOT, No Build scenarios are considered baseline conditions, which includes socioeconomic forecasts but
without implementing projects, such as major roadway improvements and some private developments. At the time
the model files were obtained, HDOT was currently working on the build scenario that modeled future projects.
Because some of the roadway improvements listed in the TIAR were absent from both the 2020 No Build model and
2035 No Build model roadway networks, the roadway network for each model horizon year was updated to ensure
these future facility improvements are appropriately modeled.
                                                                                                            27

        approaches. This intersection is assumed to be constructed under cumulative base conditions, as
        it would provide access to portions of the Waiale mixed-use community.

    •   Lahaina Bypass – This two-lane highway will be located in West Maui and will extend between
        Launiupoko south of Lahaina and Honokowai to the north. This roadway improvement project
        was added to the 2020 and 2035 roadway networks of the TDFM.

    •   Maui Lani Parkway Extension – To support the Maui Lani developments and related traffic, it is
        assumed that Maui Lani Parkway will extend and connect Waiinu Street and Kuikahi Drive. It is
        assumed that the extension will provide one lane in each direction.

    •   Puunene Avenue Widening – The 2020 and 2035 roadway networks of the TDFM includes the
        widening of Puunene Avenue from two to four lanes from Wakea Avenue to Kuihelani Highway.

    •   Roadway Detailing for Waiale – To support the Waiale project and related traffic, the construction
        of the following roadways are assumed within the Waiale project site: Road A, Kamehameha
        Avenue extension, Road C, and Road B. These roadways are assumed to be constructed under
        cumulative base conditions, as it would provide access to various areas of the Waiale mixed-use
        community.

    •   Waiale Bypass – Waiale Road would extend from its existing terminus at Waiko Road to intersect
        Honoapiilani Highway approximately one mile south of Honoapiilani Highway/ Waiko Road. It is
        assumed that the bypass would be constructed as a two-way, two-lane roadway and left-turn
        pockets will be provided at key intersections, including the two future study intersections
        (discussed below).

    •   Intersection 6: Waiale Road & Waiko Road – This intersection will become a four-legged
        intersection under cumulative base conditions and the fourth (south) leg will be constructed as
        part of the Waiale Bypass. It is assumed that the reconfigured intersection will consist of one left-
        turn lane and one shared through/right-turn lane at the eastbound and southbound approaches,
        while the northbound and westbound approaches are assumed to consist of one left-turn lane,
        one through lane, and one right-turn lane. This existing, unsignalized intersection is assumed to
        become signalized as part of the construction of the Waiale Bypass.

    •   Intersection 13: Honoapi`ilani Highway & Waiale Road – This future intersection will consist of a
        northbound approach that provides one through lane and one free right-turn lane, a southbound
        approach that provide one through lane and one left-turn lane, and a westbound approach with
        one left-turn lane and one right-turn lane. This intersection is assumed to be signalized and
        constructed as part of the Waiale Bypass project under cumulative base conditions.

Cumulative Base Traffic Projection Methodology

Related projects were checked against the model growth between the base year (2007) and each of the
horizon years (2020 and 2035) to see if the land use and socioeconomic attributes included the known
related projects, such as those listed in Table 4. Since the horizon year models obtained from HDOT were
                       5
No Build scenarios, some of the major projects planned in the vicinity of the WCT study area were
noticeably absent in the TDFM’s projections; therefore, in order to appropriately model these future
projects, the respective land use and socioeconomic attributes were adjusted for the corresponding
horizon year the related projects are anticipated to be completed by. The changes in land use and
socioeconomic assumptions between the updated 2020 and 2035 model were then used to interpolate the
land use and socioeconomic data for the scaled 2022 and 2026 models, which were used to forecast
cumulative base traffic volumes for 2022 and 2026, respectively.

After the land use and socioeconomic data adjustments were completed, trips generated by the related
projects were estimated and assigned by the model to the future roadway system based on their locations
and anticipated distribution patterns. The geographic distribution of traffic generated by new
development depends on several factors, such as the type and density of the proposed land uses, the
geographic distribution of the population from which employees and/or patrons may be drawn, the
geographic distribution of activity centers (employment, commercial, and other) to which residents of
proposed residential projects may be drawn, and the location of those developments in relation to the
surrounding future street system.

                 6
Between 2013 and 2026, the TDFM anticipates an aggregate, island-wide growth of approximately 17,000
households and about 24,000 employees for Maui. Additionally, after land use and socioeconomic data
adjustments were completed for the 2026 model, the TDFM projected an approximate 20% increase in
demand over existing conditions along Honoapiilani Highway between Kuikahi Drive and Kuihelani Highway.
The TDFM also projected an approximate 30% increase in demand along Kuihelani Highway over existing
                                                                       7

    The Base Year (2007) for the TDFM was adjusted to include known socioeconomic changes up to 2013 (See
Appendix C for specific projects). Therefore, the updated Base Year TDFM used in this analysis reflects land use and
employment updates between 2007 and 2013.

    The overall percentage increase in traffic demand was based on averaging the calculated percentage increase in
each of the PM peak hour roadway segment volumes between the updated base year and 2026 horizon year models.

CUMULATIVE BASE TRAFFIC VOLUMES

The resulting cumulative base traffic volumes and the anticipated lane configurations, representing future
conditions without the project for year 2022 and 2026, are presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5,
respectively. These future projections take into account the estimated overall growth in the surrounding
area without the addition of traffic generated by the proposed Waikapu Country Town Project. To analyze
level of service, post-processed model volumes for the 2022 cumulative base and the 2026 cumulative
base were loaded into Synchro 8.0.



PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

Development of future traffic projections related to the amount of traffic added to the roadway system by
WCT is estimated using a three-step process: (1) project trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. The first step estimates the amount of project-generated traffic will be added to the roadway
network. The second step estimates the direction of travel to and from the project site. The new trips are
assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning movements during the third step. This
process is described in more detail in the following sections.


PROJECT STREET SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

Based on feedback from agency staff and review of the proposed street network, the proposed
transportation system changes described previously are anticipated to occur between 2013 and
2022/2026 and are therefore included in the cumulative base traffic network. Additional improvements
will be made as part of the proposed project and are listed below:

    •   Intersection 9: Honoapiilani Highway & Main Street – This future intersection will be constructed
        as part of the Year 2022 Conditions (Phase 1) of the proposed project.           The intersection is
        assumed to be configured with northbound and southbound approaches that provide one left-
        turn lane, one through lane, and one right-turn lane and eastbound and westbound approaches
        that provide one left-turn lane and one shared through/right-turn lane.

    Prior to the installation of a traffic signal, it is recommended that a full warrant analysis be conducted based on
field-measured traffic data and a thorough study of traffic and roadway conditions by an experienced engineer.
Furthermore, the decision to install a signal should not be based solely on the warrants because the installation of
signals can lead to certain types of collisions. The responsible state or local agency should undertake regular
monitoring of actual traffic conditions and collision data and conduct a timely re-evaluation of the full set of warrants
to prioritize and program intersections for signalization.

    Based on consultations with the County, approximately 100 acres will be dedicated to consolidated facilities for
water, parks, environmental management, and public works departments. The primary access to these uses is planned
to be via Kuihelani Highway, however, some vehicles and maintenance trucks will likely access these uses via the
Waiale Bypass. This analysis assumes that such mauka access will be via the east leg of Intersection 10: Waiale Road
& Main Street. Additionally, the fire station, emergency management center, and regional park access will be through
the east leg of Waiale Road & Main Street. Based on the best available data, traffic projections for theses uses have
been estimated and applied to the intersection analysis.

PROJECT TRIP GENERATION ESTIMATES

                                                     th
Vehicle trip rates presented in Trip Generation 9         Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2012)
were used to estimate number of trips to and from the proposed project. The trip generation rates used
in this study and the estimated new numbers of trips generated by the proposed project in 2026 are
summarized in Table 5.

Project trip generation estimates are commonly developed using Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) rates. However, ITE rates are typically obtained from isolated, suburban developments generally not
sensitive to the trip-making characteristics of mixed-use developments such as WCT.                 In fact, few
methodologies are available to estimate the unique trip generation characteristics of mixed-use and infill
developments. One of the most commonly used methods is to use trip generation rates or equations
from Trip Generation and apply reductions from the mixed-use internalization spreadsheet from Trip
                         nd
Generation Handbook, 2        Edition (ITE, 2004). This method has some shortcomings in that it is based on a
limited sample of six mixed-use sites in Florida, it is limited to three land use types (residential, retail, and
office), and it does not take into account the influence of nearby land uses.

More comprehensive analyses of mixed-use and infill trip generation were developed and presented in
the following research studies: Traffic Generated by Mixed-Use Developments – A Six-Region Study Using
Consistent Built Environmental Measures (Reid Ewing et al., September 2008) and National Cooperative
Highway Research Program Report 684: Enhancing Internal Trip Capture Estimation for Mixed-Use
Developments (Bochner et al., March 2011). The two studies examined over 260 mixed-use development
sites throughout the U.S. and, using different approaches, developed new quantification methods. Fehr &
Peers has reviewed the two methods, including the basis, capabilities, and appropriate uses of each, to
produce a new method (MXD+) that combines the strengths of the two individual advances to best
practice. MXD+ recognizes that traffic generation by mixed-use and other forms of sustainable
development relate closely to the density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, transit proximity, and
scale of development. MXD+ improves the accuracy of impact estimation and trip internalization and

                                                                                                              36

gives planners a tool to rationally balance land use mix and to incorporate urban design, context
compatibility, and transit orientation to create lower-impact development.

Accordingly, the MXD+ process was used to estimate more appropriate internalization and non-
motorized trip reductions to apply to the ITE-based automobile trip generation for WCT. The MXD
reductions for full buildout of WCT ranged from 22% to 27% during the peak hours and 15% for daily.
Using the MXD+ process to inform and refine the internalization and non-motorized trip reduction
estimate used for the project trip generation, it was determined that the application of a 15% daily
reduction and a 25% AM and PM peak hour reduction were appropriate to account for the infill and
mixed-use nature of the land use plan where vehicle trips would be linked (i.e. residential-school-retail
interplay) and/or replaced with walk and bicycle trips to nearby land uses. The MXD+ model inputs and
results are provided in Appendix D.

As shown in Table 5, by 2026 and completion of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of WCT, the project full
buildout is estimated to generate approximately 19,000 daily trips, including about 1,200 AM peak hour
trips (409 inbound and 746 outbound) and about 1,500 PM peak hour trips (852 inbound and 633
outbound).

The MXD+ process was also used to estimate more appropriate internalization and non-motorized trip
reductions to apply to the ITE-based automobile trip generation for just WCT Phase 1. The MXD
reductions for partial buildout of WCT ranged from 26% to 35% during the peak hours and 17% for daily.
The variation in reductions related to internal capture and non-motorized trips between the full buildout
reductions are because a smaller portion of the makai and mauka side of the WCT project will be
developed and less residential units will be constructed by Phase 1. Using the MXD+ process to inform
and refine the internalization and non-motorized trip reduction estimate to be used for the Year 2022
project trip generation, it was determined that the application of a 15% daily reduction and a 25% AM and
PM peak hour reduction would still be the appropriate, conservative approach.

With the application of the reductions to the WCT Phase 1 trip estimates, the partial buildout of the
project is expected to generate approximately 13,100 daily trips, including about 700 trips during the AM
peak hour (306 inbound and 427 outbound) and about 1,000 trips during the PM peak hour (552 inbound
and 460 outbound). These WCT Phase 1 trip estimates were then used to conduct the traffic analysis for
the Year 2022 with Partial Development Conditions. Appendix E provides the vehicle trip generation
estimates for Phase 1 and Appendix D provides the corresponding MXD+ model inputs and outputs.

[a] Fitted curve equations were used to derive AM peak hour, PM peak hour, and daily trip generation.
[b] The country town mixed-use residential units and the multi-family residential units were all analyzed as apartments for conservative trip generation analysis purposes.
[c] Does not include the 29,250 square feet of existing commercial uses located in the same area as the “village center,” which will remain.
[d] Elementary school student body assumed based on information provided in the latest Waikapu Country Town Land Use Plan dated March 3, 2014 and further
consultation with the Planning Consultants Hawaii, LLC and Hawaii Department of Education, Facilities.
[e] Reductions related to internal trip capture and non-motorized trips are due to residential-school-retail interplay. An estimated 15% reduction of daily trips and 25%
reductions of the AM and PM peak hour trips were made to account for the mixed-use nature of the site, where vehicle trips can be linked and/or replaced with non-
motorized trips. The MXD process was used to confirm and refine the initial reduction estimate. The MXD+ estimates peak hour internalization at 22% to 27%.
[f] Based on the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition, 2004, the estimated pass-by trip credit (assuming all WCT commercial space is for retail) is about 33%.
However, because some space is expected to be service-oriented or small office, and to provide a more conservative analysis it is estimated that the pass-by credit is
10% and 20% of the net daily and net AM and PM peak hour retail trips, respectively.

Figure 6 illustrates the net new 2022 Phase 1 project-generated traffic volumes for the AM and PM peak
hours at each of the study intersections. Figure 7 illustrates the net new 2026 project-generated traffic
volumes with Phase 1 and Phase 2 project-generated traffic volumes for the AM and PM peak hours at
each of the study intersections. The project trips shown on these figures reflect the inclusion of pass-by
trips at some of the project intersections.


PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

The trip distribution pattern was informed by a select zone analysis of the project site using the TDFM.
Based on the model data and other refinements (i.e., adjustments based locations of complementary land
uses), the following overall trip distribution pattern was estimated for the project-generated traffic:

    •   2% to/from the west for employment based trips
    •   25% to/from the south for household based trips and 30% to/from the south for employment
        based trips
    •   65% to/from the north for household based trips and 58% to/from the north for employment
        based trips
    •   100% to/from the north for school-related external trips
    •   10% to/from nearby developments or mixed-use communities for both household and
        employment based trips

Based on the trip distribution pattern discussed above, the estimated project trips were assigned to the
future roadway network that will be in place by 2022 and 2026, the horizon years in which buildout of
Phases 1 and 2 of WCT are planned to be completed, respectively. As discussed, this analysis assumes that
the Waiale Bypass would be in place to serve project-related and other traffic.


CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

The project-generated traffic volumes were added to the cumulative base traffic projections to develop
the cumulative plus project traffic forecasts for 2022 and 2026. Figure 8 illustrates the anticipated lane
configurations and projected Year 2022 with Partial Development AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes
at each of the study intersections. Figure 9 illustrates the anticipated lane configurations and the Year
2026 with Project AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at each of the study intersections. At a few
locations, differences in the future roadway network with Phase 1 and with Phase 2 of the project will
result in slightly different trip assignments.

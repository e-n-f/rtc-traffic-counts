U.1      INTRODUCTION

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u) Information about significant potential adverse impacts of construc-
tion and operation of the proposed facility on the ability of public and private providers in the
analysis area to provide the services listed in OAR 345-022-0110, providing evidence to support
a finding by the Council as required by OAR 345-022-0110.

Response: Under Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) 345-022-0110, the Energy Facility Siting
Council (Council) must find that the construction and operation of the facility, taking into
account mitigation, are not likely to result in significant adverse impacts on the ability of public
and private providers within the analysis area described in the Amended Project Order to provide
sewers and sewage treatment, water, storm water drainage, solid waste management, housing,
traffic safety, police and fire protection, health care, and schools.

For the Perennial Wind Chaser Station project (Project), the analysis area for potential impacts
on public service is defined as the Site Boundary and 10 miles from the Site Boundary, per the
Amended Project Order. The Site Boundary and the analysis area boundary are shown on Figure
U-1.

The jurisdictions located within the 10-mile boundary of the analysis area, and their populations,
are shown in Table U-1.

U.2       IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL IMPACTS

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(A) The important assumptions the applicant used to evaluate
potential impacts.

Response: The Project will be located in Umatilla County, Oregon, approximately 3 miles
southwest of the Hermiston city limits. However, the analysis area also includes parts of
Morrow County, Oregon, and Benton County, Washington. For analysis purposes, only Oregon
communities were considered for potential impacts to public services because:

      ·   The areas of Benton County that fall within the analysis area have very low populations
          and do not include any incorporated areas or Census Designated Places.
      ·   Nearly all service providers in Benton County operate out of Prosser or the Kennewick
          area, both of which lie outside the Project's analysis area.
      ·   Given the large number of service providers available on the Oregon side of the
          Columbia River, it is unlikely that demands will be placed on providers from
          Washington.
The Project includes the following components, which are described in detail in Exhibit B ­
Project Information:

      ·   20-acre Energy Facility Site, including a station composed of four GE LMS100
          combustion turbines and auxiliary systems, a four-cell cooling tower, five fuel gas
          compressors, a switchyard, a 2,800 square-foot control building, smaller buildings to
          house water, chemical and electrical equipment, a potable water system, septic system,
          fencing, a loop road and access roads inside the site, and a stormwater detention basin;
      ·   Upgrades to an existing 12-mile, 230-kilovolt transmission line to the Bonneville Power
          Administration (BPA) McNary Substation;
      ·   A new 3-acre step-up substation and a 477-foot underground transmission cable; and
      ·   A new 4.63-mile natural gas pipeline lateral that will be constructed within the existing
          right-of-way (ROW) that services the Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP).

This assessment of the Project's impact on public services considered the size of the workforce,
the temporary nature of the construction period, and the estimated permanent work force. These
factors were then evaluated to determine if the level of service currently provided to
communities would be adversely impacted as a result of the Project.

The general contractor for the Project is expected to temporarily relocate supervisory
personnel and some skilled workers to the local area. Due to the location of the Project, it is
estimated that up to 65 percent of craft may come from outside the analysis area. Wherever

possible, construction and service providers are expected to be from local Oregon communities,
primarily Hermiston, Umatilla, Stanfield, Irrigon, and Boardman.

Construction is anticipated to take approximately 22 months. At peak construction, it is
estimated that 200 to 225 construction workers will be employed at the Project site. Operation of
the Project will require approximately six to eight permanent employees.

The upgrades to the existing transmission line and construction of the step-up substation will be
managed by the Umatilla Electric Cooperative. No permanent employees will be required to
operate the transmission line or step-up substation. The new step-up substation and underground
transmission line to the BPA McNary Substation will be constructed on federal land managed by
the BPA.

The natural gas pipeline will be constructed within an existing 4.63-mile ROW and managed by
the Cascade Natural Gas Corporation using a local contractor. Construction will take place
within the same timeframe as the transmission line and the Project as a whole. No additional
permanent employees will be required to operate the natural gas pipeline.


U.3      PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS IN THE ANALYSIS AREA

U.3.1 Sewage Collection and Treatment

Construction: Portable toilets will be used during construction of the Project, and sanitary
sewage will be managed and transported to a licensed sewage treatment plant by a contractor.
The closest wastewater treatment plant is the City of Hermiston's Recycled Water Facility.

Operation: During operation, sewage collection, treatment, and disposal will be conducted
through an onsite septic system, and no service providers will be required.

U.3.2 Water Supply and Disposal

Construction: All non-potable water used for construction activities will be obtained from the
Port of Umatilla, using temporary pumps and conduits until the permanent system is built (see
"Operation," below, for a description of water supply during operation).

Non-sewage wastewater generated during testing and commissioning of the water supply
systems, hydrostatic testing and flushing of the water lines, washing equipment and vehicles, and
washing concrete trucks after delivery of concrete loads will be treated with an oil/water
separator and managed to prevent offsite discharge. Wastewater will be tested (dependent upon
its use) to determine the concentrations of the constituents present, then either trucked offsite for
processing and disposal in an approved facility or routed to the HGP to supplement its cooling
tower makeup water demand.


Application for Site Certificate                    U-4                                             Exhibit U
Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                           2014
Operation: Under average operating conditions, the Perennial Wind Chaser Station (Station) is
anticipated to use 1,319 gallons per minute (gpm) of raw water for industrial purposes. Under
summer peak use conditions, raw water use would be slightly greater, at 1,637 gpm. The Port of
Umatilla system will supply raw water via a new pipeline from the HGP with a dedicated
capacity of 2,000 gpm to meet this need.

Potable water needs are less than 5,000 gallons per day (gpd) and will be supplied either from an
onsite well or from a tie-in to the Port of Umatilla raw water line, with appropriate
supplementary treatment.

It is estimated that approximately 90 percent of the raw water used by the Project plant will be
lost in process use. Residual wastewater (other than sewage) will be reclaimed of in one of the
following manners:

    ·    Preferred option: Wastewater will be reclaimed and sent to the cooling tower basins of
         the HGP, which is operated by a subsidiary of Perennial Power Holdings, Inc., to be
         recycled as circulating water for the HGP or sent on to the Lamb Weston Hermiston
         Plant. The only exception is combustion turbine water wash wastes, a total of 4,000
         gallons per year (less than 0.001 percent of total incoming water), which will be trucked
         offsite for processing and disposal.

    ·    Alternative option: Under this option, a Zero-Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system would be
         incorporated into the Project, such that the only wastewaters produced would be sewage
         (treated, as discussed in Section U.3.1) and combustion turbine water wash wastes
         (trucked offsite for processing and disposal). The ZLD alternative is being investigated
         because the Project will be dependent upon the third party Water Pollution Control
         Facilities (WPCF) Permit of Lamb Weston's Hermiston Plant with regard to managing its
         reclaimed waters. Lamb Weston's WPCF Permit allows Lamb Weston to manage and
         dispose of the HGP's reclaimed water. Lamb Weston's WPCF permit is currently being
         renewed through the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Because the
         permit is under review, Lamb Weston has not been able to consent to the Project sending
         reclaimed water over to the HGP. If Lamb Weston is eventually able to accept reclaimed
         water from the HGP generated by the Station, then Perennial will prefer to have all the
         necessary process and approvals in place to do so. This exhibit, therefore, will detail any
         likely adverse impacts from both the preferred option (reclamation via the HGP) and the
         alternative option (ZLD).

Appendix O-1 of Exhibit O ­ Water Use contains a letter from the Port of Umatilla stating that it
has the capacity and permits needed to supply the quantities of water necessary for the
construction and operation of the Project. More detailed information on water availability is
provided in Exhibit O ­ Water Use. More detailed information on wastewater disposal methods
is provided in Exhibit V ­ Solid Waste and Wastewater.

Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                  2014
U.3.3 Stormwater

Construction: Stormwater runoff will be controlled onsite through best management practices
such as mulching, silt fences, grading, berms, and temporary collection basins. Perennial will
manage stormwater and other surface water discharges in conformance with the issued National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Construction Stormwater Permit 1200-C. A
copy of the submitted permit application and a letter from the DEQ stating their anticipated
timeline in issuing the permit are provided in Exhibit I ­ Soils, Appendix I-2.

Operation: The operational facility will divert stormwater into an onsite 0.9-acre lined detention
basin. The low annual precipitation rate, high evaporation rate, and high observed rates of
percolation onsite (Shannon & Wilson 2013) indicate that the expected stormwater accumulation
will be low. It is proposed that the infiltration and evaporation basin be designed for a 100-year
return period 24-hour storm event plus another 50 percent capacity.

U.3.4 Solid Waste

Construction: Perennial and its construction contractor will minimize waste and recycle as much
material as possible. Solid waste that cannot be recycled will be transported to an approved
landfill. The nearest approved landfill is the Finley Buttes Regional Landfill, located
approximately 14 miles west of the Project site, as shown in Figure U-1.

Operation: Solid waste generated during operation of the Station will be collected by Sanitary
Disposal, Inc., who has the franchise for solid waste disposal in western Umatilla County (Jewett
2013). The Station is expected to be classified as a Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity
Generator of Hazardous Waste per 40 Code of Federal Regulations 261.5, meaning that it will
produce less than 220 pounds per month of hazardous waste (see Exhibits E ­ Permits and V ­
Solid Waste and Wastewater for applicable permits and explanation of how Perennial will
manage and/or recycle its solid waste).

U.3.5 Police and Fire

The region is served by a variety of law enforcement and fire protection service providers.
However, since the majority of construction workers will be dedicated to the construction of the
Station, and during operation employees will be located only at the Station, the police and fire
service providers likely to be affected are those with jurisdiction near Hermiston.

Perennial has therefore consulted with the following entities regarding potential impacts on law
enforcement services and fire protection services:

Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                 2014
    ·    Oregon State Police;
    ·    Umatilla County Sheriff's Office; 1
    ·    City of Hermiston Police Department; and
    ·    Hermiston Fire & Emergency Services.

The City of Umatilla Police Department will not be affected by the Project, and none of the
Project components, including the transmission line ROW, will be located within the city's
boundary. The following section describes the current levels of police and fire services available
to the communities in the analysis area.

911 Services

Emergency communication for geographic areas within Umatilla County is managed by the
Umatilla County Telecommunications/911 Center. The center is located in Pendleton and
receives both emergency 911 and non-emergency calls from the cities of Adams, Athena, Echo,
Helix, Meacham, Pendleton, Pilot Rock, Stanfield, Ukiah, Umatilla, and Weston, as well as the
unincorporated areas of Umatilla County, including the Project location (Umatilla County
2013b).

For the city of Hermiston, the Hermiston Police Department Communications Center is the
Public Safety Answering Point. The Telecommunications Specialists also dispatch for
Emergency Medical and Fire Services for Rural Fire Districts for Hermiston and Stanfield (City
of Hermiston 2013b).

Law Enforcement

The Oregon State Police are responsible for primary law enforcement for state facilities, such as
state roads and, as needed, support local law enforcement authorities. For Umatilla County, the
State Police work out of the Pendleton Area Command, with a work site in Hermiston.

The Hermiston Work Site is supported by five troopers and one sergeant. There are two 8-hour
shifts that run from 6 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. The State Police have mutual
aid agreements with the respective County Sheriffs' Offices. These agreements position the
Sheriffs' Offices as the primary law enforcement agency, with the state police providing backup
as needed. For Umatilla County, the County Sheriff's headquarters is in Pendleton, but a
Sheriff's office is also located in Hermiston that is currently staffed with four deputies (Oregon
State Police Staff 2013).

 Attempts to contact Undersheriff Littlefield and Sheriff Rowan were made via telephone on February 6, 2014, and
via email on February 14, 2014. There have been no responses to date.

Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                              2014
Although the Project will not be located within the city limits of Hermiston, the City Police
Department can provide backup support as needed. The City Police Department has a total of 27
paid and volunteer personnel, including positions for four sergeants and 12 patrol officers. In
addition, the City has four detective staff positions (City of Hermiston 2013b).

Fire Protection

The Project site is located within Hermiston Fire and Emergency Services District. The District
has a total of 43 paid and volunteer fire and rescue personnel (IFA 2013; Hermiston Fire &
Emergency Services 2013). The District operates out of three fire stations, with the #3 station
located approximately 2 miles from the Project site. It maintains a ladder truck with a 75-foot
delivery system capable of dispensing water or foam, plus additional fire trucks, pumper trucks,
water tenders, and two hazardous material teams with support vehicles (Phillips 2013).

The Project is located within the Region 10 Oregon Hazardous Materials team boundary. The
State of Oregon has 13 Regional Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Teams who are
charged with protecting life and the environment by responding to chemical emergencies and
minimizing the dangers associated with them. These teams are located statewide to provide
response to hazardous materials incidents and consist primarily of volunteer and career
firefighters, with some law enforcement and public works employees (Oregon State Police
2013). The Region 10 team is led by Hermiston Fire and Emergency Services in the analysis
area (Ruiz-Temple 2014).

U.3.6 Health Care

As required by the Amended Project Order, the analysis area for health care impacts is extended
to the nearest health care facility, regardless of its distance from the Project site.

The nearest full service health care center to the Project site is the Good Shepherd Medical
Center, located approximately 5 miles from the Project, which provides Trauma Level III
services. The Center includes a 25-bed hospital and an emergency room that is open 24 hours a
day (Good Shepherd Health Care System 2013). Saint Anthony's Hospital in Pendleton is a 25-
bed facility also located in Umatilla County and is designated as a Trauma Level IV service
provider by the Oregon Health Authority (St. Anthony Hospital 2013; Oregon Health Authority
2013a).

For ambulance service, the Hermiston Fire and Rescue District operates five ambulances to
provide emergency medical transportation. Fire-Med, a commercial ambulance service provider,
is also available to provide emergency medical transportation (Hermiston Fire & Emergency
Services 2013).

For evacuation services, Life Flight Network provides air medical evacuation services from
multiple bases in eastern Oregon, including Pendleton, and has reciprocal agreements with
Northwest Medstar, which operates out of Tri-Cities, Washington (Hermiston Fire & Emergency
Services 2013; Northwest Medstar 2013; Life Flight Network 2013).

For mental health care services, Blue Mountain Recovery Center is a 60-bed inpatient adult
mental health care facility in Pendleton, operated by the Oregon Health Authority's Addictions
and Mental Health Division (Oregon Health Authority 2013b).

U.3.7 Schools

School enrollment and capacity data for public schools in the analysis area are summarized in
Table U-3. The data show that enrollment growth in recent years in the analysis area has been
concentrated primarily in the Hermiston School District and secondarily in the Umatilla School
District. Both of these districts may therefore be experiencing capacity issues in certain schools
and may be affected by an influx of new workers into the analysis area.

U.3.8 Housing

Housing Units/Vacancy Rate

U.S. Census data from 2010 show that there are a total of 35,135 housing units in Morrow and
Umatilla Counties. For Morrow County housing units, there is a vacancy rate of approximately
11.8 percent, and for Umatilla County, approximately 9.4 percent. For the city of Hermiston,
Oregon, the community in closest proximity to the Project, there are 6,373 housing units, with a
vacancy rate of 5.1 percent (U.S. Census Bureau 2010).

Perennial expects that temporary construction workers will either (a) live in their current
communities, (b) be travelling construction workers living in their own trailers, or (c) will obtain
temporary housing within the vicinity of Hermiston, Oregon. The construction workforce is
expected to be spread over a period of 22 months, with a peak workforce of 225 workers.

U.3.9 Roads and Traffic

The Umatilla County Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining county roads
and bridges immediately adjacent to the Project. The Oregon Department of Transportation is
responsible for the maintenance of state roads and Interstate highways within Oregon. Enforce-
ment of traffic safety is the responsibility of law enforcement agencies, as noted above.

A Project-specific Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) has been performed to determine the Project's
potential impacts on traffic and road safety, as well as any potential actions needed to mitigate
these impacts. The TIA report is provided as Appendix U-1.


U.4      ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE ABILITY OF PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE
         SERVICES

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(C) A description of any likely adverse impact to the ability of the
providers identified in OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(B) to provide the services listed in OAR 345-
022-0110.

Response: In general, the Project will impose very little new demand on local public service
providers for either construction or operational needs.

The construction and operation of the Project will create some demand for services due to onsite
activities. This demand is expected to affect water supply and disposal, solid waste disposal, and
police and fire services.



Application for Site Certificate                      U-10                                    Exhibit U
Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                     2014
New demand for offsite services is likely to be minimal, given the very limited influx of new
workers into the area as a result of the Project. Perennial expects the existing industrial
base/skilled labor in the region to be an important component of the labor used for the Project
during construction. Because of the duration of the construction period and the use of local
contractors and labor as much as possible, it is unlikely that new families would move
permanently to the area. During operations, the Station will create six to eight full-time jobs
over the course of the lifetime of the energy facility.

The following sections describe potential adverse impacts expected for each service type.

U.4.1 Sewage Collection and Treatment

Construction: No adverse impact to providers is expected. The American National Standards
Institute calls for one portable toilet per 10 workers for a 40-hour work week. For a peak
construction crew of approximately 225 workers, as expected for the Project, approximately 25
portable toilets will be required. According to staff at the City of Hermiston's Recycled Water
Facility, the volume of wastewater associated with 25 portable toilets will not pose any impact to
the ability of the facility to provide service. The facility has a current receiving capacity of 1.7
million gpd of sewage, and this capacity will increase to 3.4 million gpd when a new plant comes
online in November 2014 (Schmittle 2014).

Operation: No adverse impact to service providers is expected, as no service provider will be
employed for sewage collection and treatment. An onsite septic field will be constructed. Prior
to construction of this system, Perennial will apply for a construction installation permit from
the DEQ in Pendleton. Results from the preliminary geotechnical report indicate that it is
possible to design a septic system that meets DEQ requirements. Details of the Project's
sanitary system and its compliance with DEQ rules regarding septic systems are included in
Exhibit V ­ Solid Waste and Wastewater, Appendix V-2.

U.4.2 Water Supply and Disposal

Construction, Supply: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. Perennial anticipates
using approximately 2.3 million gallons of water over the entire construction phase, equivalent to
less than 20 hours of the dedicated 2,000 gpm allocation of water available from the Port of
Umatilla.

Construction, Disposal (non-sewer): No adverse impact to service providers is expected.
Disposal of non-sewage water during construction would take place as described in Section
U.3.2. Perennial will manage stormwater and other surface water discharges in conformance
with the issued NPDES Stormwater Discharge General Permit #1200-C. A copy of the NPDES
application and DEQ's Acknowledgement Letter is included in Exhibit I ­ Soils.

Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                  2014
Operation, Supply: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. As described, the
Station will be supplied with process water from the Port of Umatilla, and potable water will
come from an onsite well or as a tie-in to the process water line with appropriate treatment.
Potable water demand is anticipated to be below 5,000 gpd. Therefore, potential well water
usage should be limited enough (< 5,000 gpd) not to require a groundwater permit.

For process water, as noted in Exhibit O ­ Water Use, all water required for the Project's
construction and operation will be supplied by the Port under a reserved allocation capacity.
Oregon Water Resources Department Permit S-49497 allows the Port to appropriate up to 155
cubic feet per second (cfs) of Columbia River water. This appropriation is less than 0.2 percent
of the 95 percent exceedance of the Columbia River. By 2027, the Port estimates water demand
to be about 59 cfs, per its Revised Water Management and Conservation Plan issued in
September 2008, which is only 38 percent of its allocation to provide water to its entire service
area (Port of Umatilla 2008). Even fully utilized, the 2,000 gpm reserved allocation for the
Project is only 2.9 percent of the Port's total allocation.

A letter from the Port of Umatilla confirming availability of raw water is provided in Appendix
O-1 of Exhibit O ­ Water Use.

Operation, Disposal (non-sewer): No adverse impact to service providers is expected.

    ·    Under the preferred option (reclamation and reuse), all industrial water discharges will be
         routed to the HGP for reuse as make-up cooling water. As noted in Exhibit O ­ Water
         Use, discharges will be intermittent, peaking at 315 gpm during summer operations.
         Nevertheless, reuse by the HGP is possible because of the higher quality of wastewater
         generated from the Project. The HGP will be able to handle the variable rates of
         incoming reclaimed wastewater. Exhibit V ­ Solid Waste and Wastewater provides
         additional information regarding process wastewater handling at the Project and at the
         HGP.
    ·    Under the alternative option (ZLD), industrial water discharges would be treated onsite
         through a High-Efficiency Reverse Osmosis process. This process would allow the
         treated wastewater to return to the plant as new process water, thus reducing the demand
         for raw water from the Port of Umatilla.

U.4.3 Stormwater

Construction: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. As stated in section U.4.2,
Perennial will manage stormwater and other surface water discharges in conformance with the
issued NPDES Stormwater Discharge General Permit #1200-C. A copy of the NPDES
application and DEQ's Acknowledgement Letter is included in Exhibit I ­ Soils.

Operation: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. Perennial will construct the
Station to prevent stormwater from leaving the Site. This will be achieved by grading the Site


Application for Site Certificate                U-12                                        Exhibit U
Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                   2014
and installing stormwater detention soil berms around the Station and a stormwater detention
basin. Detailed design of the stormwater drainage system and basin have not been completed,
but given the low annual precipitation, high percolation rate, and high evaporation rate,
significant stormwater accumulation is not anticipated. It should be noted that the HGP also has
a stormwater detention basin, and this system has worked very well for that facility. It is
proposed that the basin be designed for a 100-year return period 24-hour storm event, plus
another 50 percent capacity.

Further information on the proposed stormwater detention basin, including data and calculations
to determine the most efficient size and location, is provided in Exhibit V ­ Solid Waste and
Wastewater, Appendix V-3.

U.4.4 Solid Waste

Construction: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. Total solid waste production
during construction is estimated at about 2.5 tons per month over the 18 months of significant
construction. Construction solid waste that cannot be recycled or reused will be trucked to an
approved landfill. The nearest approved landfill is Finley Buttes Regional Landfill. Expected
impact on landfill capacity is minimal, as the Finley Buttes Regional Landfill has an estimated
lifetime of over 200 years and an annual receiving capacity of 1,000,000 tons of waste (Young
2013).

Operation: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. The Station will produce
approximately 10 tons per year of refuse during normal operation. Operation of the Station will
include following a waste minimization plan. Solid waste will consist of office and maintenance
waste with very limited amounts of hazardous waste such as batteries, fluorescent lights, or
equipment and vehicle maintenance solvents and oils. Any recyclable materials will be
separated from the solid waste stream. If a ZLD system is installed (see Sections U.3.2 and
U.4.2), that system will produce approximately 1,540 tons per year of crystallized solids as a
byproduct of the treatment of industrial water discharges. This solid waste is expected to be non-
hazardous and transported to a landfill.

The contracted solid waste management provider in western Umatilla County is Sanitary
Disposal, Inc., and it is expected that they will provide solid waste pick-up during operations,
and that they will take waste to the Finley Buttes Regional Landfill. Given the receiving
capacity of the Finley Buttes Landfill (which currently receives 600,000 tons per year and can
handle over 1,000,000), this should not pose a significant impact on the ability of this waste to be
received by a landfill (Large 2013). In addition, Sanitary Disposal, Inc. has confirmed that the
higher quantity of waste under the ZLD option, corresponding to an average of 30 tons/week,
can be handled without affecting its ability to provide waste disposal services in the area (Jewett
2013).

Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                  2014
U.4.5 Police and Fire

Construction: Due to an increase of construction personnel traveling to the Project site and
potentially living in the area, there may be a short-term impact on local law enforcement and fire
agencies. Jason Edmiston, Chief of Police, indicated that any Project-related impact would be
due to added calls for service, and that the added load would not have an impact on the
Hermiston Police Department's ability to provide service (Edmiston 2014). The Assistant Chief
for Hermiston Fire and Emergency Services has stated that the Project will pose no significant
impact on Hermiston Fire and Emergency Services' ability to provide public service in their
district (Stanton 2013). Evidence regarding the likely extent of these impacts is detailed in
Section U.5.1.

Operation: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. The Station will employ only
six to eight people, so new offsite demand for police and fire services will be minimal. The
limited potential impact due to onsite activities is itself mitigated by the following:
    ·    Regarding law enforcement, the Project will be fenced within an industrial area with a
         monitored gated entrance. Once operations have begun, an access gate, closed circuit
         television camera, and security lighting will be installed on the site. The step-up
         substation will have a perimeter fence. These measures will minimize opportunities for
         theft and vandalism.
    ·    Regarding fire and rescue services, all fire protection equipment will be stored at the
         Station, in accordance with the Oregon Fire Code.

U.4.6 Health Care

No adverse impact to service providers is expected during construction or operation, due to the
number and proximity of available health care facilities in the region and the small incoming
population during the construction and operations phases. There is redundancy in both regional
hospital facilities (available in Hermiston and Pendleton) and in transport options in case medical
evacuations are required.

U.4.7 Schools

Construction: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. The total estimated influx of
workers renting or purchasing permanent housing in the area is 15 (see section U.4.8, below),
corresponding to up to 30 children, assuming two children per worker. Both local school
districts experiencing growing enrollment (Hermiston School District and Umatilla School
District) have confirmed that receiving the total estimated influx within their district would not
have an impact on their ability to provide service (Sipe 2014; Smith 2014). No impact is
expected in other school districts, as their enrollment has been stable or in slight decline.



Application for Site Certificate                 U-14                                        Exhibit U
Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                    2014
Operation: No adverse impact to service providers is expected, as there will only be six to eight
permanent jobs at the facility.

U.4.8 Housing

Construction: No adverse impact is expected. Due to the site's remote location, Perennial
anticipates that up to 65 percent of craft could migrate into the area during the construction
period. However, only 10 percent of the in-migrating workforce is expected to rent or buy
permanent housing. The majority of in-migrating workers are expected to bring their own
trailers. As a result, Perennial anticipates that no more than 15 housing units will be rented or
bought in the area by in-migrating construction workers. There were 182 vacant rental units in
the cities of Hermiston, Stanfield, and Umatilla in 2010, based on U.S. Census information, as
shown in Table U-4. Therefore, housing demand generated by the active construction site will
not substantially impact the availability of housing in the analysis area during the construction
period.

Operations: No adverse impact is expected. The six to eight permanently employed staff will
have an insignificant impact on the availability of local housing.

U.4.9 Roads and Traffic

Construction: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. A TIA for the Project was
conducted, and the results are provided as Appendix U-1. This assessment verified the traffic
impact of the Project during both the construction and operations phases at the following nearby
intersections:

    ·    Interstate Highway 82 (I-82) Southbound (Eastbound) Ramps at Lamb Road,
    ·    I-82 Northbound (Westbound) Ramps at Lamb Road,
    ·    Interstate Highway (I-84) Eastbound Ramps at Westland Road,
    ·    I-84 Westbound Ramps at Westland Road,
    ·    Lamb Road at Westland Road, and
    ·    Westport Lane at Westland Road.

The TIA found that all of the studied public roadways and intersections within the vicinity of the
Project will continue to operate within the applicable performance standards established by
Umatilla County and the Oregon Department of Transportation. Additionally, the TIA evaluated
truck turning paths and safety standards at the site-access intersection on Westland Road and
developed recommended access design plans for the both the construction phase and permanent
operation. Perennial will maintain contact with Umatilla County to ensure the final site access
configuration complies with the recommendations of the TIA.




Application for Site Certificate               U-15                                        Exhibit U
Perennial Wind Chaser Station                                                                  2014
Operations: No adverse impact to service providers is expected. The estimated six to eight full
time personnel required during operation of the Station will have minimal impact.


U.5      EVIDENCE THAT ADVERSE IMPACTS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE
         SIGNIFICANT AND RELEVANT MITIGATION MEASURES

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(D) Evidence that adverse impacts described in OAR 345-021-
0010(1)(u)(C) are not likely to be significant, taking into account any measures Applicant
proposes to avoid, reduce or otherwise mitigate the impacts.

Response: As discussed in Section U.4, adverse impacts are possible for police and fire services
and for schools. These impacts would occur only during the construction phase. No adverse
impacts are expected during the operation phase. The following subsections outline the evidence
regarding the extent of any adverse impacts and detail the mitigation measures to address any
identified significant impacts.

U.5.1 Police and Fire

Construction: Hermiston Fire & Emergency Services does not expect the Project to have any
significant impact on the district's ability to provide services, since construction work does not
involve closing any roads (Stanton 2013). Impact on law enforcement should also be
insignificant, as many construction personnel will already be living in the study area, and
anticipated traffic impacts suggest that the need for additional traffic control is extremely limited
(see Section U.4.9).

Mitigation: Based on the above information, any adverse impact on police and fire service
providers will not be significant. Therefore, no mitigation measures are proposed.


U.6      MONITORING PROGRAMS

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(E) The applicant's proposed monitoring program, if any, for impacts
to the ability of the providers identified in OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(B) to provide the services
listed in OAR 345-022-0010.

Response: Because the construction and operation of the Project will have no significant adverse
impacts on the ability of service providers in the analysis area to provide the services assessed in
this exhibit, there are no monitoring programs under development in relation to impacts.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Perennial-Windchaser LLC (Perennial) is seeking permits to construct and operate a natural gas-fired
electrical generating plant northeast of the I-82/I-84 Interchange in western Umatilla County, Oregon.
The traffic-related impacts of the completed project as well as those impacts during the peak
construction phases are addressed within this Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) report. Based on existing
traffic operations and the estimated future traffic conditions, the proposed development is not
expected to have a significant impact on the adjacent roadway traffic operations upon build-out.
Furthermore, during the construction phase, all study intersections will continue to operate within the
applicable performance standards and targets.

This TIA report resulted in the following key findings and recommendations.


FINDINGS
               All of the study intersections and critical movements operate acceptably during the
               weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
               No safety deficiencies or crash patterns were identified at the study intersections.
               Under 2017 background conditions, all study intersections are forecast to continue
               operating acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
               The proposed Perennial Wind Chaser Energy Facility (Station) is estimated to generate
               approximately 8 and 12 trip ends during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours of a typical weekday,
               respectively.
               Under year 2017 total traffic conditions with the addition of permanent site-generated
               traffic, all study intersections are forecast to continue operating within acceptable
               performance standards during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
               At the peak of the construction period, the projected construction effort is estimated to
               generate approximately 196 trip ends during each of the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
               hours.
               Under year 2016 total traffic conditions with the addition of construction-related traffic, all
               study intersections will continue to meet the relevant performance targets.
               The proposed site access on Westland Road conforms with Umatilla County's access
               management standards.
               Intersection sight distances are adequate at both the permanent and temporary
               (construction-related) proposed site access intersections.

               existing guard rail at the railroad crossing, provided that all truck movements are made
               to/from the south (i.e. via the I-84/Westland Road interchange).
               During construction of the site, the proposed temporary site-access driveway design, which
               shifts the access south of the permanent driveway location utilizing the adjacent property,
               will accommodate full turning movements for standard trucks sizes (including the WB-67
               design vehicle).


RECOMMENDATIONS
               To ensure that all truck movements at the site-access intersection under the permanent
               operation are made to and from the south, truck turn restriction signs should be mounted
               at the site-access intersection as follows:
                     A right-turn prohibition sign with a supplemental "TRUCKS" rider plaque should be
                     mounted facing the westbound (driveway) approach.

                     A left-turn prohibition sign with a supplemental "TRUCKS" rider plaque should be
                     mounted facing the southbound (Westland Road) approach.

               If truck delivery of oversized loads is required during construction of the Station, a formal
               routing and delivery plan should be developed by the contractor in conjunction with ODOT
               and Umatilla County staff. These oversized vehicles may require special geometric and/or
               traffic control accommodations that are beyond the scope of this analysis.
               Locate and maintain site landscaping, signing and any aboveground utilities to ensure that
               adequate sight distance is maintained after build out.

INTRODUCTION

SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This analysis determines the transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed Station. A
site vicinity map is provided in Figure 1. As shown, the site is located in Umatilla County near the
junction of Interstate 82 and Interstate 84; there are six (6) study intersections for which the traffic
impact of the proposed Station was analyzed. The study scope and overall study area for this project
were selected based on a review of the local transportation system and conversations with the project
team, Umatilla County, and Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) staff. The report addresses
the following transportation issues:

     ·    Existing year 2013 traffic conditions during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours;

     ·    Forecast year 2017 background traffic conditions during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours
          (this does not include the construction traffic or the site-generated traffic, but does include
          general growth and planned developments in the site vicinity);

     ·    Forecast year 2017 total traffic conditions with full build-out of the project during typical
          weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours (this includes full build-out daily operations with site-
          generated traffic);

     ·    Forecast year 2016 total traffic conditions with peak construction of the project during typical
          weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours (this includes peak construction daily operations with site-
          generated traffic); and,

     ·    Analysis of the proposed project's construction phase to address heavy vehicle operations, peak
          traffic flows, transportation network geometry, safety, and efficiency.

Based on our review of the surrounding road network, previous traffic analyses, and conversations with
Umatilla County staff, the following study intersections were included as part of the transportation
analysis:

               I-82 Southbound (Eastbound) Ramps at Lamb Road (ODOT maintained)
               I-82 Northbound (Westbound) Ramps at Lamb Road (ODOT maintained)

Data Collection
The following data were collected to support the operations and safety analysis for this study:

     ·    2-hour mid-week turn movement counts conducted at each of the study intersection.

     ·    24-hour mid-week tube counts conducted along Westland Road and Lamb Road

Appendix A includes the collected traffic counts.


Operations Parameters
All level-of-service (LOS) analyses were performed based on procedures outlined in the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board (Reference 1). Appendix B includes a
description of LOS methodology.


Operating Standard
As defined in Umatilla County's 2002 Transportation System Plan (TSP) (Reference 2), the applicable
performance standard for the County intersections is LOS E or better (See Attachment B). The state
highway mobility target as set forth by ODOT in the Oregon Highway Plan (Reference 3) for the study
intersections at the freeway ramp terminals is a maximum volume-to-capacity ratio of 0.80.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and geometric characteristics of the
roadways within the study area. Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried the site
and surrounding study area in October 2013. At that time, KAI collected information regarding adjacent
land uses, existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in the study area.


SITE CONDITIONS AND ADJACENT LAND USES
The approximately 20-acre Station site is currently undeveloped and located east of Westland Road and
south of the Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP) and Union Pacific Railroad line. The Station site may be
described as a tract of land in the Northwest Quarter of Section 30, Township 4 North, Range 28 East,
Willamette Meridian; said tract being divided by the O.W.R. & R. Railroad. In addition to its proximity
to HGP, the FedEx Freight LTL site is located near the Station site, north and east of the Interstate 84
and Interstate 82 interchange in western Umatilla County. Access to the FedEx site is from a private
road, Westport Lane, which intersects with the County road, Westland Road.

Access to the Station site is proposed via a new driveway that would be located approximately 600 feet
north of Westport Lane and approximately 105 feet south of the Union Pacific Railroad line (measured
from center of driveway to center of railroad tracks). Figure 2 shows the proposed site plan and site
access location.


TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Table 1 summarizes the existing transportation facilities and roadways in the study area. The existing
intersection lane configurations and traffic control devices are illustrated in Figure 3.

Safety Analysis
The crash history at each study intersection was reviewed in an effort to identify potential safety issues.
Crash records were obtained from ODOT for the five-year period from January 1, 2008 through
December 31, 2012. Table 2 shows a summary of the crashes at each study intersection. As shown,
there have been no more than two crashes at any study intersection over the most recent 5-year
analysis period. As such, there are no distinguishable patterns of intersection-related crashes to
warrant safety-based mitigations.

As shown in Exhibit 1, there is a noticeable directional split relative to peak periods along Lamb Road.
The a.m. peak hour occurs from 6:00 to 7:00 a.m. with a heavier flow in the westbound direction, while
the p.m. peak hour occurs from 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. with a heavier flow in the eastbound direction. As
shown in Exhibit 2, there is also a noticeable directional split relative to peak periods along Westland
Road. The a.m. peak hour occurs between 6:00 and 7:00 a.m. for the southbound direction, while the
p.m. peak hour occurs between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. for the northbound direction.

The peak period turning movement counts were analyzed to identify a system peak hour at the study
intersection. The morning peak hour was observed to occur from 6:05 to 7:05 a.m. and the afternoon
peak hour was observed to occur from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. The turning movement counts were
summarized and rounded to the nearest five vehicles per hour as shown in Figure 4.

For operational analysis purposes, 30th highest hour volume (30HV) were calculated in accordance with
procedures presented in ODOT's Analysis Procedures Manual (APM) (Reference 4). The agriculture
trend was used from the Seasonal Factor Table to estimate the seasonal adjustment factor, as
calculated below:

Traffic Counts (15-October) = 0.9263 =     1.16
Peak Period Seasonal Factor = 0.7981

Therefore, all study intersection traffic volumes were increased by a factor of 1.16 to develop the 30
HV.

As shown in Figure 4, all study intersections operate acceptably during the peak season weekday a.m.
and p.m. peak hour analysis periods. Attachment D contains the existing traffic operations worksheets.

TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The transportation impact analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will operate
upon full build-out of the Station. The following analyses are provided within this section:

               Forecast year 2017 background traffic conditions (includes regional growth and in-process
               planned developments during the build-out year, but does not include traffic from the
               proposed development) during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours;
               Forecast year 2017 total traffic conditions (includes background traffic growth and the
               forecast site-generated traffic upon build-out of the site) during the weekday a.m. and p.m.
               peak hours;
               Forecast year 2016 total traffic conditions with peak construction of the project during
               typical weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours (includes peak construction daily operations due
               to site-generated traffic); and,
               Analysis of the project construction phase to address heavy vehicle operations, peak traffic

YEAR 2017 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The background traffic analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will operate in the
build-out year of the proposed development without site-generated traffic from the proposed
development. The purpose of this analysis is to establish a basis of comparison for future conditions. As
such, the background traffic analysis includes traffic growth from developments in the area plus general
growth in the region, but does not include the traffic from the proposed development.


Planned Developments and Transportation Improvements
Based on information provided by Umatilla County, the Westland Road Travel Center is a pending
development approximately ½ mile south of the Station site. While the land use process is ongoing for
this project, it has been included in this analysis as an in-process development in order to provide a
conservative assessment of future traffic conditions.

A Traffic Impact Analysis Report (Westland Road Travel Center TIA) was most recently prepared by KAI
in December 2013 documenting the estimated weekday p.m. peak hour trip generation and the
transportation impacts of the proposed development. The development will be located west of
Westland Road, south of Stable Road, and north of I-84 and will include a truck fueling station, market,
truck-washing station, auto fueling station, and restaurant space. The estimated trip generation for the
site as described in the report is approximately 470 trips during the weekday p.m. peak hour (225 in,
245 out) and 460 trips during the weekday a.m. peak hour (220 in, 240 out). The a.m. in-process trips
were estimated by applying trip rates from the Trip Generation manual, 9th Edition for the assumed
land uses. Attachment E contains the in-process traffic volumes.

Regional Growth
To account for regional growth, a 1.0 percent annual growth rate was applied based on conversations
with Umatilla County staff. The year 2017 background traffic operations include the anticipated traffic
from the in-process development as well as general regional growth in traffic volumes and are shown in
Figure 5. As shown, each of the study intersections is forecast to continue to operate acceptably.

YEAR 2017 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The total traffic analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will operate in the build-
out year with the completed proposed development traffic on the transportation system. As such, the
year 2017 total traffic analysis includes traffic growth from developments in the area, general growth in
the region, and forecast traffic from the proposed development.

Proposed Development plan
Perennial Wind Chaser LLC proposes to construct and operate up to four General Elective (GE) natural
gas-fired combustion turbine generators, which will produce up to approximately 415 megawatts of
electric power. Access to the site is proposed via a new private driveway as shown in the proposed site
plan on Figure 2. The following sections summarize the expected operational characteristics of the
surrounding roadway network during typical daily operations of the proposed development.

Trip Generation
Once constructed and operational, the Station will have a relatively consistent operational pattern.
Based on information supplied by the operator of the proposed facility, the plant will operate under the
following characteristics:

               Typical operations will consist of approximately 6-8 daily employees, with an average day
               shift of about 6 employees and an average evening staff of about 2 employees to perform
               general operation and maintenance duties. Each shift will be 12-hours in duration with shift
               changes expected to occur at 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
               Truck deliveries will be limited to daily parcel delivery services and weekly chemical supply
               services.
               Visitors will access the facility on an infrequent basis and typically during daytime operating
               hours.
               The facility will be accessed via a gated private access drive on Westland Road, as shown in
               Figure 2.
Table 4 shows the estimated trip generation based on the above characteristics for the proposed
development daily operations.

The estimated trip distribution pattern and site-generated trip assignment are summarized in Figure 6.
The trip distribution pattern was developed based on existing turning movement counts. As a result, it
is expected that approximately twenty-five percent of trips will originate north of the I-82/Lamb Road
interchange; fifty percent will originate east of the Westland Road/Lamb Road intersection, and twenty-
five percent east of the Westland Road/I-84 interchange.


Year 2017 Total Traffic Operations
The site-generated volumes shown in Figure 6 were added to the background volumes shown in Figure
5 to arrive at the 2017 total traffic volumes shown in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 7, each of the study
intersections is forecast to continue to operate acceptably during 2017 total traffic conditions.

YEAR 2016 PEAK CONSTRUCTION TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
A transportation assessment of the construction period was prepared in addition to build-out year 2017
total traffic conditions to support the application process. This assessment includes an evaluation of
each study intersection, focusing on the ability to adequately accommodate construction traffic from an
operations and safety perspective. The following section summarizes the expected operational
characteristics of the surrounding roadway network during the construction phase of the project.


Year 2016 Background Traffic
To account for regional growth, a 1.0 percent annual growth rate was estimated using historical and
nearby jurisdiction trends. The year 2016 background traffic operations include the anticipated traffic
from the Westland Travel Center development as well as general regional growth in traffic volumes.


Peak Construction Trip Generation
It is expected that construction worker and truck traffic will be an important element to address in the
application and approval process. As such, KAI has worked with the project team to obtain a
preliminary breakdown of the staffing levels during the construction period. Estimates of pertinent
information obtained include the following:

               The total construction period is estimated to last approximately 16 months and may begin
               as early as 2015 depending upon completion of the review and approval process for
               Perennial's Site Certificate Application.
               At the peak of the construction period, approximately 225 workers will be employed at the
               site, and will all work the same day shift (7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.).
               Forty truck deliveries are assumed to be distributed evenly throughout the day shift.

As described above, a higher number of vehicle trips are expected to travel to and from the site during
the construction phase than during post-construction daily operations. During the peak construction
period, a maximum of approximately 225 day-shift workers are anticipated to be working on-site during
a typical workday. Based on experience at other large construction sites, a 1.2 vehicle occupancy rate is
anticipated for workers traveling to and from the site during construction phase. A traffic operations
analysis was conducted for this peak of construction, considering vehicle occupancy, to identify the
reasonable worst-case potential peak hour impacts of the construction phase traffic on the study
intersections. Based on this conservative trip generation approach, the estimated site-generated trips
during peak construction are shown in Table 5.

The estimated trip distribution pattern is summarized in Figure 8 along with the site-generated trip
assignment. The trip distribution pattern was developed based on existing turning movement counts.
As a result, it is expected that approximately forty percent of trips will originate north of the I-82/Lamb
Road interchange; forty percent will originate east of the Westland Road/Lamb Road intersection,
fifteen percent east of the Westland Road/I-84 interchange, and five percent west of the Westland
Road/I-84 interchange.

The site-generated volumes shown in Figure 8 were added to the 2016 background volumes to arrive at
the 2016 total traffic volumes shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 9, each of the study intersections is
forecast to continue to operate acceptably during 2016 total traffic conditions. Attachment H contains

SITE-ACCESS DRIVEWAY DESIGN REVIEW
KAI has reviewed the design of the site-access driveway and coordinated with the site designers as well
as staff from Umatilla County and ODOT Rail Division to ensure that the proposed site-access
intersection conforms to current operational and safety standards of practice.

A scaled depiction of the proposed permanent driveway design is shown in Figure 10. Given the higher
volume of traffic and delivery vehicles that will be accessing the site during construction of the Station,
Perennial has proposed to construct a temporary access roadway approximately 75-100 feet south of
the permanent driveway, utilizing a portion of the adjacent property under a temporary agreement
with the property owner. A conceptual layout of the temporary site-access driveway is shown in Figure
11. Under the temporary access scenario, the permanent access intersection would not be open and all
traffic movements will be made at the temporary driveway.

This review included assessing access management standards, truck turning accommodations,
intersection sight distances, and spacing to the railroad grade crossing. The remainder of this section
summarizes the finding and recommendations related to this review.

Access Management Standards
The Umatilla County Transportation System Plan provides recommended access management
standards for County-owned roadways. As a Major Collector, Westland Road has an access spacing
standard of 250 feet between private driveways and 500 feet between public roads. Based on a review
of recent aerial photography and field observations, the proposed driveway for the Perennial Wind
Chaser Station development would be approximately 250 feet to the nearest driveway to the north.
This driveway appears to be a seldom-used access point for maintenance vehicles to access the
drainage canal. The nearest driveway of consequence to the north is the Hermiston Generating Plant
Access, which is approximately 670 feet from the proposed site access. To the south, the nearest access
point is Westport Lane, which is located approximately 580 feet from the proposed site-access
driveway. Therefore, the proposed driveway location conforms to the County's access management
standards.

Intersection Sight Distance
KAI conducted field reviews of intersection sight distances at the proposed site access point on
Westland Road. Intersection sight distances were evaluated in accordance with the guidelines outlined
in the 2011 AASHTO publication A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. Based on the
55-mph design speed of Westland Road, the AASHTO-computed intersection sight distance is 610 feet.
Field observations revealed that grades along Westland Road are relatively flat and there are no
landscape features or objects that would obstruct sight distance from either the permanent access
point or the temporary access point. Therefore, this analysis concluded that intersection sight distances
are adequate from the proposed site access locations. All new site landscaping, signing and any
aboveground utilities should be located and maintained to ensure that adequate sight distance is
maintained after build out.

                                                                                    Transportation Impact Analysis


Truck Turning Analysis
KAI reviewed standard truck turning paths at both the permanent access intersection and the
temporary (construction-related) access intersection.

Permanent Driveway Design
Under the permanent (post-construction) operation of the Station, truck deliveries will be infrequent
and typically consist of weekly delivery of chemical supplies. Due to the relatively narrow property
frontage in combination with the existing guard rail located at the railroad crossing gate, the permanent
site-access driveway cannot be designed to accommodate truck movements to or from the north.
Therefore, all truck movements to the Station should be directed to enter the site from the south (i.e.
from the I-84/Westland Road interchange). Additionally, all trucks exiting the site should be directed to
turn left out of the driveway onto southbound Westland Road (towards I-84). Figures 12 and 13 show
the inbound and outbound turning paths, respectively, for the WB-67 design vehicle under the
permanent driveway configuration.

To enforce the intended ingress and egress truck routes, truck turn restriction signs should be mounted
at the intersection as follows:

               A right-turn prohibition sign with a supplemental "TRUCKS" rider plaque should be mounted
               on the westbound (driveway) approach at the intersection.
               A left-turn prohibition sign with a supplemental "TRUCKS" rider plaque should be mounted
               on the southbound (Westland Road) approach at the intersection.

Temporary Driveway Design
Under the temporary driveway configuration with the access shifted to the south onto the adjacent
property, it is anticipated that the intersection will accommodate full turning movements for standard
trucks. Figure 14 shows the inbound and outbound right-turn paths for the standard WB-67 design
vehicle.

With regard to oversized loads, it is expected that the construction process will necessitate the delivery
of several over-dimensional items such as turbines and heat recovery systems. Although the specifics
are not yet known, it is anticipated that some over-dimensional items may arrive at the construction
site via the existing rail line directly adjacent to the site. For those over-dimensional items that cannot
be delivered to the site via the rail line, the remaining items will then need to be delivered via truck.
Given that these items typically require the use of specially designed over-sized trailers, a formal
routing plan and delivery plan is expected to be developed by the contractor in conjunction with ODOT
and Umatilla County for these deliveries.

Spacing to Rail Crossing
KAI coordinated with staff from ODOT's Rail Division to ensure the proposed site access design would
meet ODOT's operational and safety standards with respect to the adjacent signalized at-grade rail
crossing on Westland Road. The jurisdiction of the state for the regulation of highway-rail grade
crossings includes all roadways open to and used by the public, which are equipped with protective
devices. In the case of the Westland Road rail crossing, the state's jurisdiction extends a distance of 495
feet from the rail crossing, measured back from the location of the stop clearance lines at the grade
crossing. As the proposed site-access intersection for the Station would be located approximately 80
feet from the nearest stop clearance line on Westland Road, it is located within ODOT's jurisdiction.

After reviewing the preliminary site plan, ODOT Rail Division staff concluded that the existing crossing is
not being altered by the proposed site development, and therefore the proposed access location would
be acceptable.1 ODOT staff also noted that truck turning paths should be reviewed to ensure that
turning movements at the driveway would not require modification of the existing guardrail. An
analysis of truck turning movements was presented in the preceding section of this report. As
previously discussed, all truck deliveries to the site under the permanent operation (post construction)
will be made by entering from and exiting to the south on Westland Road. Therefore, truck movements
will only include the northbound right-turn into the site and the westbound left-turn movement out of
the site. As shown in Figures 12 and 13, these truck movements will be accommodated without
impacting the existing guard rail. Additionally, during construction of the Station, a temporary driveway
design has been proposed such that full-access truck movements will be accommodated without
impacting the guard rail (see Figure 14).

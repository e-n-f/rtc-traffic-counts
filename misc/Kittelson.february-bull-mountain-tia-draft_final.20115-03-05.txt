From:           Julia Kuhn, PE & Anais Malinge
Project:        River Terrace Community Plan
Subject:        Bull Mountain Dickson Traffic Impact Study


Polygon Northwest is proposing to develop four new subdivisions in Tigard’s River Terrace Community
Plan Area. Each of these subdivisions has been contemplated within the City’s River Terrace
Community Plan. The projects Polygon proposes to develop include:

              South River Terrace – this neighborhood will be located on the south side of Bull Mountain
               and east side of Roy Rogers Road. At this point, 190 residential units are proposed, 63 of
               which will be attached, and 127 will be detached single family homes. This project will
               incorporate the portion of the north-south collector proposed (River Terrace Boulevard) on
               the east side of Roy Rogers Road as part of the River Terrace Community Plan that is within
               the property boundaries.
              Roshak Ridge – this neighborhood will be located on the north side of Bull Mountain Road
               and east side of Roy Rogers Road. At this point, 244 residential units are proposed, 78 of
               which will be attached and 166 will be detached single family homes. This project will
               incorporate the portion of the north-south collector proposed (River Terrace Boulevard) on
               the east side of Roy Rogers Road as part of River Terrace Community Plan that is within the
               property boundaries.
              West River Terrace – this neighborhood will be located along the west side of Roy Rogers
               Road to the north of Bull Mountain Road and northwest of Roshak Ridge. At this point, 138
               residential units are proposed, 46 of which will be attached and 92 will be detached single
               family homes. This project will incorporate the portion of the east-west Lorenzo Lane
               collector street and the north-south neighborhood route on the west side of Roy Rogers
               Road that are proposed as part of River Terrace Community Plan and within the property
               boundaries
              Bull Mountain Dickson – this neighborhood is proposed on the west side of SW 150th
               Avenue opposite the SW Hawks Ridge Road. At this point, 82 detached single family homes

                 are proposed. No collector streets or neighborhood routes are currently identified in the
                 River Terrace Plan on this property.
Figure 1 shows the location of each of these proposed neighborhoods. Separate but similar traffic
impact studies will be prepared for each development. This report presents our findings and
recommendations associated with the Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood.

Based on the analysis herein, the following recommendations are associated with the development of
the Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood:

                 SW 150th Avenue should be widened to provide half street improvements along the site
                 frontage.
                Intersection sight distance should be provided at all local street intersections created as
                 part of the neighborhood. Landscaping, above ground utilities, and signing should be
                 located and maintained in a manner that preserves adequate intersection sight distance.
                Pacific Community Design has measured and analyzed intersection sight distance at the SW
                 150th Avenue/SW Colorado Avenue intersection and has addressed this under separate
                 cover.
The study concludes that the proposed neighborhood can occur while maintaining acceptable traffic
operations and safety at the study intersections. Additional details of the methodology, findings and
recommendations are provided herein.


INTRODUCTION
Today, the Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood site is primarily undeveloped. Single family
neighborhoods abut the property to the north and east. The new neighborhood is part of the overall
development contemplated by the River Terrace Community Plan. The neighborhood will access SW
150th Avenue at two locations. SW Colorado Street will be constructed opposite SW Hawks Ridge Road
at the intersection with SW 150th Avenue. SW Danube Drive will access SW 150th Avenue to the north
of SW Colorado Street. The proposed site plan is shown in Figure 2.


STUDY SCOPE
This analysis identifies the transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed site
development and was prepared in accordance with discussions with City of Tigard and Washington
County staff.

The study intersections include:

                SW 150th Avenue/SW Bull Mountain Road

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
All level of service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 1). A description of level of service and the
criteria by which they are determined is presented in Appendix A. Appendix A also indicates how level
of service is measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service.

Synchro7 software was used for all intersection operations, in accordance with the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual. To ensure that this analysis was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, the peak
15 minute flow rate during the peak hour analysis periods was used in the evaluation of all intersection
levels of service. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to occur for 15
minutes out of each average peak hour. Traffic conditions during other weekday hours and throughout
the weekend will likely be better than those described in this report.


Operating Standards
The City of Tigard’s code and requirements are still being developed through the River Terrace
Community Planning. Based on prior analyses and direction from city staff this report assumes that the
standard for the city intersections is a v/c ratio of 0.95 with no movements over capacity.

Washington County requires that all intersections operate with a volume-to-capacity ratio of less than
0.99.


Queuing
Queuing analyses presented in this report were conducted using 95th percentile queue lengths
estimated by the Synchro7 software.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies site conditions and the current operational and geometric
characteristics of roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.

The site of the proposed development and surrounding study area was visited and inventoried in
February 2015. At that time, information was collected regarding site conditions, adjacent land uses,
existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in the study area.


Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The overall River Terrace Community is being rezoned for urban uses and was annexed into the City of
Tigard. Today, the site of Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood is occupied by a single family residence

Transit Facilities
No transit service is provided by TriMet in close proximity to the site today. The closest transit service is
provided by Route 92, which has bus stops near the Murray Boulevard/SW Scholls Ferry Road
intersection. Per the River Terrace Community Plan TSP Addendum, future transit service needs will be
identified in collaboration with TriMet, the City of Tigard, and Washington County.

Existing Traffic Operations
Manual turning-movement counts were conducted at the study intersections in January 2015. The
counts were conducted on a typical mid-week day during the morning peak period (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.)
and the evening peak period (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.). Intersection peak hours were used to provide a
conservative analysis. Figure 3 provides a summary of the existing turning-movement counts, which are
rounded to the nearest five vehicles per hour for the weekday AM and PM peak hours, respectively.
Appendix B contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.

As shown in Figure 3, each of the study intersections operates acceptably today.

Appendix C contains the existing conditions traffic operations worksheets.

TRAFFIC SAFETY
Washington County maintains a Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) list to identify existing hazardous
intersections for potential safety improvements. Intersections are included in the SPIS list if they have
three or more crashes or if they have one or more severe injury or fatal crashes within three
consecutive years. None of the study intersections appear on the most recent Washington County SPIS
list (2010-2012) (Reference 2).

In addition to reviewing the Washington County SPIS list, crash histories at each of the study
intersections will be reviewed in an effort to identify potential intersection safety issues. At the time
the study was prepared, the crash data still wasn’t available from ODOT. A supplemental memo will be
submitted when this data is received.

Intersection Sight Distance
Pacific Community Design measured intersection sight distance at the location of the future local street
intersections with SW 150th Avenue that will serve the neighborhood. They have addressed the sight
distance under separate cover.


TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
The traffic impact analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system will operate upon
build out of the proposed Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood.
The longer term transportation needs and improvements associated with buildout of the River Terrace
Community are addressed as part of the Community Plan’s TSP Addendum. As such, the analyses
contained within the next section of this report focuses only on the near-term impacts. These near-
term impacts were examined as follows:
                Planned developments and transportation improvements in the site vicinity were identified
                 and reviewed;
                Year 2016 background traffic conditions (build-out year of the proposed redevelopment
                 without site-generated traffic) were analyzed at the study intersections;
                Future peak hour site-generated trips were estimated for build-out of the site;
                A trip distribution pattern was prepared;
                Forecast year 2016 total traffic conditions were analyzed during the weekday a.m. and p.m.
                 peak hours with build-out of the site; and
                On-site circulation and site-access operations were evaluated.
Per the City of Tigard’s request, a separate study will be prepared that analyzes the cumulative impacts
of all of the developments that are anticipated to be proposed by Polygon, West Hills, Metropolitan
Land Group, and the Beaverton School district within the vicinity of the River Terrace Community. This
study will be prepared after the individual neighborhood studies are prepared.

Year 2016 Background Traffic Conditions
The year 2016 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system will
operate prior to the proposed Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood or any of the neighborhoods under
consideration within the River Terrace Community. As such, this background analysis assumes the
application of only a 1.5 percent annual growth rate and no improvements to the study intersections.

As noted previously, a cumulative impact study will be prepared to analyze year 2016 or 2017
conditions assuming the development of the all of the developments under consideration. This
cumulative study will be prepared after the individual studies have been submitted.

2016 Background Conditions Intersection Operations
Figure 4 illustrates the forecast 2016 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes at
the study intersections, respectively. As shown, each of the study intersections are projected to
operate acceptably during weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

Appendix D contains the background traffic analysis worksheets.


Proposed Development Plan
Polygon Northwest is proposing to develop the Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood within the River
Terrace Community Plan Area. This new neighborhood will be located on the west side of SW 150th
Avenue opposite the SW Hawks Ridge Road. At this point, 82 detached single family homes are
proposed. The neighborhood will access SW 150th Avenue at two locations. SW Colorado Street will be
constructed opposite SW Hawks Ridge Road at the intersection with SW 150th Avenue. SW Danube
Drive will access SW 150th Avenue to the north of SW Colorado Street.

The Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood will include only the construction of local streets within its
boundaries. No collector streets or neighborhood routes are currently identified in the River Terrace
Community Plan on this property. The Plan does identify the extension of Woodhue Street from SW
150th Avenue west to the planned southerly extension of SW 161st Avenue. Although Woodhue Street
is south of the Bull Mountain Dickson neighborhood, the planned north-south local streets within the
neighborhood could extend south to Woodhue Street once the property to the south is developed.


Trip Generation
Trip estimates for the proposed neighborhood were based on trip rates obtained from the standard
reference Trip Generation, 9th Edition (Reference 3). Table 2 presents the trip generation estimate used
in this study.

Trip Distribution
The distribution of site-generated trips onto the study area roadway system was estimated based on a
review of existing peak hour directional travel characteristics, existing site-driveway patterns,
surrounding roadway characteristics and land uses and information provided by Washington County
staff. The assignments of the site-generated trips to the study intersections during the a.m. and p.m.
peak hours are shown in Figure 5.


Year 2016 Total Traffic Conditions
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area’s transportation system will operate
with the traffic generated by the proposed site redevelopment. The estimated site-generated traffic
volumes were added to the estimated year 2016 background traffic volumes to arrive at the total
traffic volumes.

Figure 6 illustrates the operations at the study intersections under total traffic conditions during the
a.m. and p.m. peak hours. As shown, each of the study intersections is projected to operate within the
applicable standards during both the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

Appendix E contains the year 2016 total traffic operations worksheets.

ON-SITE CIRCULATION AND OPERATIONS
Internal circulation was evaluated to ensure that the site provides sufficient on-site circulation for
pedestrian movements and internal traffic. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed development plan.

On-site sidewalks will be provided along the site frontage and throughout the development. On-site
landscaping, signage and any above-ground utilities should be provided appropriately to ensure that
adequate sight distance is provided and maintained.


FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of this transportation impact analysis, the proposed Bull Mountain Dickson
neighborhood can be developed while maintaining acceptable levels of service and safety at the study
intersections. The primary findings and recommendations of this study are summarized below.


Findings
                The study intersections operate acceptably under existing and projected future background
                 and total traffic conditions.
                The proposed site development is estimated to generate a net increase of approximately 62
                 weekday a.m. peak hour trips and 82 weekday p.m. peak hour trips.
                Vehicle access to the development is proposed via two accesses on SW 150th Avenue.


Recommendations
                Polygon Northwest should continue to collaborate with the City of Tigard and other
                 developers on the overall timing and need of transportation improvements within the River
                 Terrace Community.

APPENDIX A LEVEL-OF-SERVICE CONCEPT
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from “A” to “F”.1


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
The six level-of-service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table A1.
Additionally, Table A2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per
vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service “D” is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

Table A-1 Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

      Level of
      Service                                                             Average Delay per Vehicle
                      Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and most
         A
                      vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
                      Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally
         B            occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of
                      average delay.
                      Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher
         C            delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
                      The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
                      Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of
                      congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
         D
                      length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle
                      failures are noticeable.
                      Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually
         E            considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long
                      cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                      Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This condition
         F            often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures.
                      Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service levels associated
with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table A3. A quantitative definition of level of service
for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table A4. Using this definition, Level of Service “E” is
generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

                     intersection.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is
that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on
the minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying
acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the HCM
level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

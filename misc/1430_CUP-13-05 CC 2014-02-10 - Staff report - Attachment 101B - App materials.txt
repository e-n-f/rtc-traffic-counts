II.   INTRODUCTION

SITE DESCRIPTION

The subject site is located at 7100 SW McEwan Road in Tualatin. The site is
approximately 10.1 acres in size and consists of a private park area and t hree existing
buildings with associated exterior storage and fleet parking. The site is zoned Light
Manufacturing (ML) and has been owned and occupied by NW Natural Gas for
training and maintenance operat ions since the 1960s.

Adjacent uses consist of a consulting firm, a medical office, two self-storage facilities
(Public Storage and Oswego Storage), and a car service facility across SW McEwan
Road. East of t he sit e is t he Southern Pacific Railroad line, separating it from the
industrial and re side ntial uses to the south and east. Just west of the site is the US
Interst ate 5 freeway . These areas are shown in the map below.

PROPOSAL

The owner/applicant is pro posing to re-use and convert the site and existing
buildings into a se lf-storage, warehouse, and truck/equipment rental facility for U-
Haul. U-Haul moving and storage centers characteristically serve the do-it-yourself
household customer. On a typical day at the U-Haul, the center will be staffed with a
general manager and three to four custo mer service representatives. Families will
generally arrive in their own automobiles, enter the customer service area, and may
choose from a variety of products and serv ices offered there. M ost families use U-
Haul self-storage facilities to store furniture, household goods, sporting equipment,
holiday decorat ions, e tc. More specifically, the proposed conversion will co nsist of:

     Building A: Approximately 20,252 SF of U-Box portable storage. The portable
      storage consist s of U-Box pods/containers which offer both on-site and secure
      warehouse storage options for short and lo ng term needs. Custo mers fill the
      portable pods/co ntainers and store and/or ship them via U-Haul.
     Building B: Approxim ately 80,618 SF of self-storage, 3,240 SF of customer
      service area, and 2,64 0 SF of dispatch and receiving bays. The self-storage area
      will consist of approximately 850 indoor, climate-controlled self-storage units.
      Customers will typically rent U-Haul equipment or use their perso nal vehicle to
      approach t he loading area and enter the building through the singular
      customer access. All new storage facilities are designed with interior storage
      room access, giving t he customer the added value of increased security, and
      the community t he benefit of a more aesthetically pleasing exterior. Storage
      customers will typically rent a room for a period of two months to one year.
      All U-Haul storage customers are issued a card-swipe style identification card
      which must be used to gain access to their room.
     Building C: Approximately 7,324 SF of sho p area. The sho p area will be used for
      very minor maintenance on the rental trucks/equipment (such as repairing
      broken t aillights, etc.) and for installing trailer and towing supplies (such as
      traile r hitches, hit ch balls and mounts, and wiring/lights). Routine/major
      maintenance of the rental trucks/equipment will be completed at the U-Haul
      Repair and Maintenance Center in Clackamas County.
     Building D: Approximately 4,433 SF of miscellaneous indoor storage.
     RV Storage Area: T he area located in the northeast corner of the site will be
      utilize d for lo ng-term RV Storage.
     Alternate Fuel: An alternative-fuel (propane) dispensing statio n for vehicles
      and backyard grills will be located near the RV gate .
     Customer Parking, Truck/Equipment Staging, and Circulation Areas: The site is
      well situate d and prov ides ample space for customer parking, truck/equipment
      staging, and vehicular/truck circulation. The customer parking areas will be
      located near the customer service center and self-storage building fo r
      customer convenie nce . Staging areas for rental trucks and equipm ent will be at
      two places: one near the customer service center for easy pick-up and drop-
      off, and anot her be tween Buildings B and C for truck and equipment
      processing.

As part of the U-Haul Center, the owner/applicant is proposing to provide accessory
truck and equipment rental se rvices in conjunction with the primary self-service
storage operat ions. The trucks and equipm ent proposed to be available for rent are
described below.

Rental Products: Trucks, vans, cargo trailers, utility trailers, and car trailers/auto-
transports will be available for re nt. Approximately 40 trucks in six truck sizes will be
available, ranging fro m 10 feet (3.0 m) to 26 feet (7.9 m), and multiple trailer sizes,
in addition to a two-wheeled "Tow Dolly" and a fo ur-w heeled "Auto Transport .” U-
Haul has two main classificat ions for equipment: "In-Town" and "One-Way .” The
"One-Way" equipment is mostly used for one-way trips, meaning pick-up and dro p-off
at differe nt locations, whereas the "In-To wn" equipment is meant to be picked up
and droppe d off at the same location, and the equipment is meant to be used for a
local move.

Rental Process: Families will ge nerally arrive in their own auto mobiles, enter the
customer service area, and re nt trucks and/or equipment (t railers, dollies, etc.) for
household moving, e ither in-town or across country. The trucks and equipment
described above will be staged in two locations on-site: one near the customer
service ce nter, for easy pick-up and drop-o ff, and another located between Buildings
B and C for processing. The rental trucks and equipment are never “parked” on-site
because they are constantly being rented and used off-site. The only time the trucks
or equipment are on-site is for drop-off and processing between rental trips.

Hours of Operati on:

                   Monday – Friday                7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
                   Saturday                       7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
                   Sunday                         9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

REQUEST

A pre-applicat ion mee ting for the proposed conversion of the former NW Natural Gas
site to the proposed U-Haul Center was held for the project o n July 18, 2013. In t hat
meeting, City staff confirmed that the self-storage component of the site is an
allowed use, but that the rental of trucks and equipment would be a conditio nal use
and would require a Conditional Use Permit. Therefore, the applicant requests a
Conditional Use Permit to allow the “Rental and leasing of autos and light
trucks…(and e quipme nt)” use as stated in Section 60.040 Conditional Uses (60.040
(1)(p)), as an accessory use to the primary allowed use of “Self -service storage .”

III.   APPROVAL CRITERIA/ REQUIREMENTS
This application addresses t he necessary approval criteria of the Tualatin
Development Code relevant to conditional uses. As described in the following
narrative, t he proposal meets the five conditio ns of Section 32.030 Criteria for
Review of Conditional Uses:

SECTION 32.030 CRITERIA FOR REVIEW OF CONDITIONAL USES.

(1) The use is listed as a conditional us e in t he underlying planning distr ict .
Response: As describe d in the Tualatin Development Code for ML districts, in Section
60.040 Condit ional Us es, “Rental and leasing of autos and light trucks with incidental
sale of vehicles.” is a condit ional use. This standard is met.

(2) The charact eristics of the s ite are suitable for the proposed us e, considering size,
shape, location, topography, existence of im provements and natur al features .
Response: Since the site was developed in the 1960s, the site has been used for
customer service, to ol and meter repairs, and fleet parking/ maintenance for NW
Natural Gas. The site is relat ively large (447,314 SF/10.3 acres), triangular in shape ,
and is gene rally flat with a gradual slope (15 feet) from the northeast corner of the
site to the sout hwest corner. Four buildings are currently located on the site and are
proposed to be converted to storage and shop space for U-Haul as described above.
In additio n, the site consists of a large o pen area, large paved areas, which are
currently occupied by approximately 206 parking spaces, wide drive aisles, and
exterior storage areas.

Due to the sheer size of the site and the amount of paved area that exists, t he site
provides sufficient area for both the circulation and staging necessary for the
proposed truck and e quipment rental operations in conjunction with the self-service
storage use s. As show n on the preliminary site plan (see Exhibit D), the staging areas
for the rental trucks and equipment are proposed in two locations, one near the
customer service ce nt er and anot her between Buildings B and C. The staging location
near the customer se rvice cente r allows customers a convenient location to pick up
and drop off the ir rentals. T his staging area is accessed via a single existing driveway
separate from t he existing main driveway. The staging area betw een Buildings B and
C will be primarily fo r processing the t rucks and equipment that come back in and
getting t hem ready to go back out. U-Haul employees will drive returned trucks and
equipment to the st aging are a between Buildings B and C for processing and drive
them back to the staging area near the cust omer service center, ready for rental. The
large site area allows for the trucks and equipment to be maneuvered between the
staging areas as nee ded. The U-Haul modifications to the site will essentially co nvert
more than 40 exist ing fleet parking spaces into staging area.

The site also benefits from having large existing buildings, as well as remarkably lush
and mature landscaping both interior to the site and along the perimeter (as shown
on Exhibit E, t he as-built landscape plans). Locating the truck and equipment staging
areas near the custo mer service area and between Buildings C and D not o nly
provides sufficie nt circulat ion and staging, but also naturally buffers and screens the

                                      Attachment 101B
                                     Application Materials
                                         Page 7 of 70
proposed truck and e quipment rental activ ities from the surrounding pro perties and
I-5.

More specifically, the staging area near the customer service area is buffered and
screened from the adjace nt properties to the north, south, and west (I-5) by a
combinatio n of Building A and significant setbacks and mature landscaping between
the staging are a and the adjacent properties (as shown in Exhibit F, Site Photos).
Similarly, the staging are a between Buildings C and D is greatly buffered and
screened from the adjace nt properties, as well as I-5 . The adjacent areas are
screened and buffered by a combination of Buildings B, C, and D, as well as
significant set backs and mature landscaping between the staging area and the
adjace nt propert ies. In addit ion to the buffers and screening provided o n-site, I-5 is
significantly scree ned from the staging area by the existing depression the freeway is
located in along w ith the be rm with new plantings alo ng the I-5 perimeter/frontage.
The de pression and berm varies between approximately 10 feet to 25 feet in height ,
making it almost impossible for drivers to look into the site. D ue to the combinatio n
of the existing scree ns and buffers, the site and locatio n of the staging areas is
suitable for t he use, and will actually decreases the visual im pacts, because the
rental trucks and e quipment uses will be further back and within the interior of the
site.

This standard is met.

(3) The proposed development is timely, considering the adequacy of trans portation
systems, public facilities, and services exist ing or planned for the area affected by t he
use.
Response: T he proposal is to convert t he existing NW Nat ural Gas operations center
into a self-se rvice sto rage facility in conjunction with rental trucks and equipment.
The site has been used for NW Natural Gas operations, including customer service,
tool and meter re pairs, and building and fleet maintenance since the 1960s. The site
is convenie ntly locate d near I-5 at the Lower Boones Ferry Road exit (290), making it
an ideal and convenient location for customers in the area renting trucks and
equipment for moving or transporting large items. Primary access to the site is from
SW McEwan Road, an established collector road with Tri-Met transit service at
several locat ions. As shown in the traffic study ( see Exhibit G), the proposed self-
service storage facilit y and truck and equipment rental use will actually generate
fewer trips t han the existing NW Natural Gas facility, and therefore will create less
intensive use s of t he street system. Therefore, the existing transportatio n system is
adequate, and there w ill be no change in the traffic operation during peak hours.

In addition, as shown on the March 11, 2013, survey (see Exhibit C), the site is
curre ntly se rved by domestic and fire water and sanitary sewer. There is an existing
4" water line and 8" sewer line located along the property frontage in SW McEwan
Road. Stormwater is curre ntly disposed of v ia 13 active and registered drywells/UICs
(underground injection control devices) located on the property. These public
facilities are anticipat ed to be adequate and capable of handling the proposed uses.

This standard is met.

(4) The pr opos ed use will not alter t he character of the s urrounding area in any
manner that substantially limits, impairs, or precludes the use of surrounding
properties for t he primary uses listed in the underlying planning district .
Response: T he rent al component of the pro posed U-Haul self-storage will not affect
the character of the surrounding area, and is closely related to the permitted uses of
the ML district. For e xample, both storage and sales of autos and light trucks are
allowed o utright in t he ML district, and the rental of U-Haul trucks does not vary
widely in nature from these uses. Adjacent properties are used for specialty retail,
warehousing, industrial use s, and self-storage. This standard is m et.

(5) The propos al s atisfies those objectives and policies of the Tualatin Communit y
Plan t hat are applicable to t he proposed use. 1

        Section 7.040 Manufacturing Planning District Objectives.
        (2) Light Manufacturing Planning District (ML).
        (a) Suit able for warehous ing, wholes aling and light manufacturing pr ocesses
        that are not hazar dous and that do not create undue amounts of noise, dust,
        odor, vibration, or smoke. Also suitable, wit h appropriat e restrict ions, are t he
        retail sale of pr oducts not allowed for sale in General Commercial areas …, and
        office commercial uses where any portion of a legally created lot is within 60
        feet of a CO Planning District boundary. Also suitable is the r etail sale of
        products manufact ured, assembled, packaged or wholes aled on the site
        provided the retail sale area, including the showroom area, is no more than 5%
        of the gross floor area of the building not to exceed 1,500 square feet. Also
        suitable for the ret ail s ale of home improvement materials and supplies
        provided it is not gr eater than 60,000 square feet of gross floor area per
        building or business …. Rail access and screened open stor age allowed in these
        areas will conform to defined architectur al, landscape and environment al
        design standards .
        Response: The proposed truck and equipment rental use will be accessory to
        the primary self-se rvice storage use. Trucks and equipment such as trailers,
        etc., are common and suitable in warehousing, wholesaling, and light
        manufacturing type o peratio ns. T he proposed truck and equipment use is not
        anticipate d to cre ate greater additio nal noise, dust, odor, vibration, or smoke
        than is typical for trucks and trailers. NW Natural Gas currently operates and
        maintains a large fle et of trucks and equipment on the site in additio n to
        performing heavy duty maintenance work. The trucks and light equipment
        offered for re nt by U-Haul are anticipated to have considerably less of an
        impact t han that of t he NW Natural Gas operations. As stated abo ve, the shop
        area (Building C) will be used for very minor maintenance on the rental
        trucks/equipment (such as repairing broken taillights, etc.) and for installing
        traile r and towing supplies (such as trailer hitches, hitch balls and mounts and
        wiring/light s). Rout ine/major maintenance of the rental t rucks/equipment will
        be complete d at the U-Haul Repair and Maintenance Center in Clackamas
        County, not on-site .

the site provided the r etail s ale area, including the showroom area, is no more
than 5% of the gr oss floor area of the building not t o exceed 1,50 0 square feet.
Certain heavier manufactur ing uses m ay be allowed as conditional uses.
Response: No heavy manufacturing or retail is proposed. The proposed use
could se rve as a buffe r from any heavy manufacturing uses.

(d) In accordance with the Industrial Business P ark Overlay District, TDC
Chapter 69, selected office and ret ail uses are allowed t o provide services to
businesses and employees. The purpose is also to allow certain commercial

Section 60.010 Purpose.

The pur pose of this district is to provide ar eas of t he Cit y that are suitable for
industrial uses and compatible with adjacent commercial and residential uses.
The district serves to buffer heavy m anufacturing uses from commercial and
residential areas . The district is suitable for warehous ing, wholesaling, and
light manufact uring processes t hat are not hazardous and do not create undue
amounts of nois e, dus t, odor, vibr ation, or smoke. The district is also s uit able
for retail sale of products manufactured, assembled, packaged or wholesaled
on the site provided the retail s ale area, including the s howroom area, is no
more than 5% of the gross floor area of the building not to exceed 1,500
square feet and, with appropr iate restrictions, for ret ail sale of products not
allowed for sale in General Commercial Planning Districts, and office
commercial uses wher e any portion of a legally creat ed lot is w it hin 60 feet of

Response: The proposed truck and equipment rental use will be accessory to
the primary self-se rvice storage use. Trucks and equipment such as trailers,
etc., are common and suitable in warehousing, wholesaling, and light
manufacturing type o peratio ns. The proposed truck and equipment use is not
anticipate d to create additional noise, dust, odor vibration or smoke than is
typical for trucks and trailers. NW Natural Gas currently operates and
maintains a large fle et of trucks and equipment on the site in additio n to
performing heavy duty maintenance work. The trucks and light equipment
offered for re nt by U-Haul are anticipated to have considerably less of a n
impact t han that of t he NW Natural Gas operations. As stated abo ve, the shop
area (Building C) will be used for very minor maintenance on the rental
trucks/equipment (such as repairing broken taillights, etc.) and for installing
traile r and towing supplies (such as trailer hitches, hitch balls and mounts and
wiring/light s). Rout ine/major maintenance of the rental trucks/equipment will
be complete d at the U-Haul Repair and Maintenance Center in Clackamas
County, not on-site .

This st andard is met.

IV.   CONCLUSION
Approval of a Condit ional Use Permit to allow the “Rental and leasing of autos and
light trucks…(and e quipment)” (60.040 (1)(p)) at t he site at 7100 SW McEwan Road
will allow a complementary use to the allo wed self- storage in the ML district. Based
upon the informatio n presente d and discussed in this narrative and the attached
supporting plans and documents, a Co nditional Use Permit for the project, as stated
in Section 60.040 Conditional Uses, merits approval.

Re:    Tualatin U-Haul
       Traffic Information Report
       Project Number 2130364.00

Dear Mr. Doran:

This letter has been prepared to address the traffic impacts of the proposed redevelopment of the NW Natural facility at
7100 SW McEwan Road in Tualatin, Oregon. U-Haul International plans to convert the site into a self-storage warehouse,
truck rental facility, and retail front for their services.

The 10.27-acre site includes seven tax lots and several existing buildings and is located east of Interstate 5, west and
north of the Southern Pacific Railroad track, and south of McEwan Road.

EXISTING CONDITIONS

Site Development

The site is currently occupied by NW Natural and serves as an operations center for various utility activities and
functions including, but not limited to, fleet maintenance, equipment storage, employee training, and administrative
offices. Figure 1 (attached) presents a vicinity map of the surrounding area.

Trip Generation

Typically, trip generation estimates would be based on rates in the current ITE Trip Generation Manual, but there are no
specific ITE land uses which fit the existing use description.

Instead, traffic volumes were counted at the site accesses for the PM peak and midday peak hours.

The resulting site trips are summarized in the following table.

PROPOSED CONDITIONS

Site Development

The applicant proposes to redevelop the existing site, making use of the existing structures. The uses will include:
        Building A (20,252 SF) – Long-term storage (U-Box portable storage, only accessed with employee assistance)
        Building B (80,618 SF) – up to 850 self-storage lockers and 3,240 SF of U-Haul retail frontage
        Building C (7,324 SF) – U-Haul truck maintenance and trailer hitch installation
        On-site truck and trailer rental and long-term RV storage

Trip Generation

Due to the unique characteristics and combination of uses at the site, there are no similar use trip rates in the ITE Trip
Generation Manual. Instead, a survey of a similar site was used to estimate overall trips.

Data was collected at a U-Haul site in Auburn, Washington. The study, conducted by Heath & Associates, Inc., is attached
for reference.

The Auburn site shares characteristics with the Tualatin site including:
        Suburban location approximately 10-20 miles to urban city center
        Visibility from freeway and close proximity to interchange
        Similar size – 10.72 acres
        Same company with similar uses:
                22,000 SF of U-Box portable container storage
                114,898 SF of self-storage
                8,795 SF of U-Haul retail frontage and offices
                25,126 SF of U-Haul truck maintenance and trailer hitch installation
                Truck and trailer rental

It should be noted that the Auburn site is slightly larger than the Tualatin site in all respects.

Existing traffic was counted at the site access for 7 days starting on May 12, 2011. Notable characteristics include:
         Peak trip generation (44 vehicles/hour) occurred on a Tuesday during the PM peak.
         Tuesday yielded a weekday off-peak generation of 38 vehicles/hour starting at 11:45 AM. This off-peak was
          higher than most peaks on the other 6 days.
         The highest non-Tuesday trip generation (40 vehicles/hour) occurred at 2:45 PM on Monday. Other typical peak
          periods yielded fewer vehicles.
         Average PM peak hour trip generation across a typical weekday (Tuesday through Thursday) was 31
          vehicles/hour.
         Average midday peak hour trip generation across the same weekdays was 33 vehicles/hour at 11:30 AM.

The resulting site trip characteristics are summarized in the following table.

As noted above, weekdays yielded higher overall peak trip generation and average peaking characteristics than the two
weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) surveyed. Even Monday’s peak of 40 vehicles per hour surpassed Saturday’s
highest peak hour, and the daily total on Friday, 342 ADT, surpassed Saturday’s total, 327 ADT.

For the purposes of this analysis, the following trip generation is proposed, assuming the smaller Tualatin site has the
same number of trips as the surveyed site in Auburn.

CONCLUSION

As shown from Table 4, the U-Haul development will not increase trips on the adjacent street system, and there will be
no change in traffic operation during peak hours.

University Ridge Student Housing                                                         April 2013



                                   Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the Final Transportation Impact Analysis
through a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

Where is the project located and what would be developed?
The proposed project is located north of Consolidation Avenue between Nevada Street and
Puget Street. The development would construct 164 residential units, which would be
marketed as student housing primarily for students attending Western Washington University
(WWU). Access to the site would be located on Consolidation Avenue. Lincoln Street and
Nevada Street are the primary north-south roadways that connect the site to the surrounding
area.

Is the site currently served by public transit?
Whatcom Transit Authority (WTA) provides transit service in the study area. The nearest
transit routes are accessed at the Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride, which is less than a half mile
from the site. Routes 80X, 90A&B, 196, and 197 serve the Park-and-Ride and connect to
WWU, Downtown Bellingham, and the surrounding Cities.

How many daily vehicular trips would the project generate and when would peak traffic
volumes occur?
The residential units will be marketed as student housing primarily for students attending
WWU. To provide for conservative analysis this study evaluated conditions as if this were a
standard mid-rise apartment complex and only assuming a reduction of 7 percent to account
for transit being in close proximity. This equates to the project generating approximately 640
daily trips with 59 trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Peak traffic volumes would occur
during the weekday PM peak hour (one- hour period between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.).

It is anticipated that the actual project will generate fewer vehicular trips than typical
apartments and what is accounted for in this analysis because the student population is more
likely to utilize transit, bike, or other non-vehicular modes of travel during the PM peak period.
This is driven by class schedules often end prior to the PM peak commute period, all WWU
students are provided Whatcom Transportation Authority (WTA) bus passes and parking fees
on the WWU campus are high. In addition, trip generation during summer months is
anticipated to be lower given that school will not be in session, which is not accounted for in
this analysis.

What transportation impacts are anticipated, if any?
The project would increase traffic volumes in the study area and contribute to increases in
intersection delay; however, all study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable
LOS D or better.

What measures are proposed to reduce or control traffic impacts?
The project would be required to pay the City's Traffic Impact Fee. The current fee is $1,925
per PM peak hour trip and reductions are allowed for the project site being located in close
proximity to high frequency transit and primarily marketing to WWU students who are
provided WTA bus passes.

University Ridge Student Housing                                                          April 2013



                         Chapter 1. Introduction
The purpose of this transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to identify potential traffic-related
impacts associated with the proposed University Ridge development in Bellingham,
Washington. As necessary, mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce
significant transportation impacts.


Project Description
The proposed project would develop 164 apartment units along Consolidation Avenue
between Nevada Street and Puget Street. Figure 1 illustrates the site vicinity. The residential
units would be marketed as student housing primarily for students attending Western
Washington University (WWU). Access to the site would be via one driveway along
Consolidation Avenue. Figure 2 shows the preliminary site plan.

Study Area and Approach
The study area and approach are based on coordination with City staff. The analysis focuses
on weekday PM peak period (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) operations at nine study intersections. The
study intersections include (see also Figure 1):
         1. Lakeway Drive/Lincoln Street
         2. Nevada Street/Lakeway Drive
         3. East Maple Street/Lincoln Street
         4. Ashley Avenue/Consolidation Avenue
         5. Nevada Street/Consolidation Avenue
         6. I-5 Northbound (NB) On-Ramp/Lincoln Street
         7. Samish Way/Bill McDonald Parkway/Byron Avenue
         8. South Samish Way/36th Street/I-5 Southbound (SB) Off-Ramp
         9. South Samish Way/Lincoln Street/Elwood Avenue

The TIA describes conditions in the site vicinity including roadway network, existing and
future (2014) weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes, traffic operations, traffic safety, non-
motorized facilities, and transit. The future conditions with the project are evaluated by adding
site-generated traffic to future baseline traffic volumes. Analysis of future conditions
addresses cumulative impacts of the proposed project and traffic growth in the study area.
Site-generated impacts are identified based on differences in transportation conditions
between with and without the project.

 Chapter 2. Existing and Baseline Conditions
This section describes existing and future baseline (without-project) conditions within the
study area. Characteristics are provided for the roadway network, non-motorized facilities,
transit service, traffic volumes, traffic operations, and traffic safety.


Roadway Network
The existing roadway characteristics in the proposed project vicinity are described in Table 1.
The site is situated on the east end of Consolidation Avenue. As shown on Figures 1 and 2,
Consolidation Avenue via Nevada Street or East Maple Street/Ashley Avenue provides
primary access to the site and connects to the greater street system along Lincoln Street and
Lakeway Drive. Sidewalk exists along Nevada Street from the site to north of Thimbleberry
Pl. Traffic calming features such as traffic circles are installed along the roadway at Edwards
Street and Orleans Street to reduce vehicle speeds and improve safety.

Note: mph = miles per hour



Planned Roadway Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Bellingham adopted Six-Year (2013-2018) Transportation
Improvement Program, there are no planned improvements within the study area that would
be completed by the 2014 horizon year. The Washington State Department of Transportation
(WSDOT) projects were also reviewed. The I-5 Fairhaven to Slater Master Plan, November
2008 analyzes current and future traffic conditions on I-5 and recommends improvements to
the interstate, interchanges, and connected local roads from Fairhaven Parkway (exit 250) to
Slater Road (exit 260). This project recommends the following at the Samish Way
interchange:
           Relocate the Samish Way interchange north of existing location
           Construct a collector/distributor road east and west of I-5 from Samish Way to Iowa
           Street

There is no funding for these improvements; therefore, the projects were not assumed in this
transportation analysis. Completion of the I-5 improvements are anticipated to improve traffic
operations and safety at the interchange.

Non-Motorized Facilities
The site is east of WWU and southeast of the central business district. Pedestrian facilities
near the site include sidewalks along both sides of Lincoln Street and the north side of
Consolidation Avenue and E Maple Street. The pedestrian pathway to the Lincoln Creek
Park-and-Ride is well served by sidewalks and includes a cut-through from East Maple Street
into the Park-and-Ride lot. Pedestrians would be better served at this location with a signed
crosswalk.

Crosswalks are provided at the signalized study intersections. Lincoln Street, Samish
Parkway, and Bill McDonald Parkway have bicycle lanes on both sides of the road. These
facilities allow for bicycle travel between the site and WWU.


Transit Service
The project site is located is close proximity to the Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride, which is
served by Whatcom Transportation Authority (WTA) routes 80X, 90A&B, 190, and 196/197.
These routes serve WWU, Downtown Bellingham, and Mt. Vernon. Route characteristics are
summarized in Table 2. The Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride is approximately a seven to eight
minute1 walk from the project site; see the pedestrian path on the map below.




Ridership to WWU is primarily concentrated on Routes 190, 90 and 197, respectively. Route
190 and 90 have the highest number of boardings per revenue hour according to the 2012
WTA Performance Report.2

Route 80X functions as a weekday commuter route between Bellingham and Mount Vernon
with 60 minute headways. There are two morning runs and two evening runs between WWU
and the Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride with a timed transfer to Route 80X. The morning trips
leave Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride at 7:23 a.m. and 8:23 a.m. and the evening trips leave
WWU at 3:08 p.m. and 5:08 p.m. This route does not operate during the summer quarter or
other times when WWU is not in session.

Routes 90A&B provide service on weekdays with approximately 30-minute headways
between the Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride and WWU. The route follows Lincoln Street, Bill
McDonald Parkway, Highland Drive, Indian Street, Potter Street, and Lakeway Drive. Route
90A travels counter-clockwise and does not stop at the Potter Street/Humboldt Street
intersection, but stops at the WWU Recreation Center. Route 90B travels clockwise and
stops at the Potter Street/Humboldt Street intersection and skips the WWU Recreation
Center. Route 90A runs from 7:41 a.m. to 4:41 p.m. and 90B runs from 7:12 a.m. to 4:39 p.m.
This route does not operate during the summer quarter or other times when WWU is not in
session.

Route 190 provides weekday service with 15 minute headways between Lincoln Creek Park-
and-Ride and Downtown Bellingham via WWU. Route 190 is along the WTA Blue GO Line.
The GO Line is WTA's bus rapid transit service that provides 15-minute headways on
weekdays along designated corridors. An additional eight bus trips are provided to and from
Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride during the PM peak hour to achieve 15-minute headways.
Route 190 also provides Saturday service from 9:10 a.m. to 5:50 p.m. with 60-minute
headways.

Routes 196 and 197 provide weekday evening service. Route 196 travels counter-clockwise
and provides 30-minute headways. Route 197 travels clockwise and provides 60-minute
headways. Both routes travel from Downtown Bellingham Station to the Lincoln Creek Park-
and-Ride via WWU. Route 196 provides Saturday service from 6:10 p.m. to 11:05 p.m. with
30-minute headways and Sunday service from 9:10 a.m. to 8:35 p.m. with 60-minute
headways. Route 197 provides Saturday service from 6:40 p.m. to 10:05 p.m. with 60-minute
headways and Sunday service from 8:40 a.m. to 8:05 p.m. with 60-minute headways.

Traffic Volumes
This transportation analysis focuses on the weekday PM peak hour when traffic volumes on
the surrounding street system would be highest to capture a relative worst case condition.
Existing weekday PM peak period (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) turning movement counts at the study
intersections were conducted in January 2013. The intersection traffic count worksheets are
provided in Appendix A. Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes are summarized on
Figure 3 and were used to establish existing traffic conditions. The traffic counts show that
intersections within the study area peak at different times during the 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. peak
period. The analysis is based on the one hour peak of each individual intersection.

A comparison of 2008 and 2013 traffic counts for study intersections shows that traffic
volume growth has ranged from less than one to two percent per year. Future (2014) without-
project traffic volumes were conservatively estimated by multiplying existing traffic volumes
by two percent per year. In addition to the annual growth in traffic volumes, traffic from
"pipeline" development or already approved projects in the study area was added to the
background traffic volumes. The only pipeline project in the study area identified by the City is
the 7-11 Convenience Market located on the northeast corner of the Samish Way/Bill
McDonald Parkway intersection. This project would redevelop an old Blockbuster Video store
into a 2,800 square-foot convenience market. Trip generation for the 7-11 Convenience
Market was based on the currency application with no credit given for the Blockbuster Video
since this building is vacant. The pipeline project trips were assigned to the study
intersections based on existing travel patterns. Figure 4 illustrates 2014 without-project PM
peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are evaluated by determining the
intersection's level of service (LOS). The intersection as a whole, and its individual turning
movements, can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A to F).
LOS A indicates free-flow traffic and LOS F indicates extreme congestion and long vehicle
delays. LOS is measured in average control delay per vehicle and is typically reported for the
intersection as a whole at signalized intersections. Control delay is defined as the
combination of initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final
acceleration delay. At two-way stop-controlled intersections, LOS is measured in average
stopped delay per vehicles for the worst movement of the intersection. A more detailed
explanation of LOS is provided in Appendix B.

Existing and future without-project LOS and delays were calculated at study intersections
based on the methods contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The software
program Synchro 8 was used to evaluate intersection operations. Table 3 shows the
weekday PM peak hour existing and without project operations. Detailed intersection LOS
worksheets are contained in Appendix C. The City of Bellingham's has a LOS E standard.
WSDOT's has a LOS D standard for the I-5 ramp intersections. As shown in the table, all
study intersections operate at LOS D or better. With growth in traffic volumes by 2014, all
study intersections would continue to operate at LOS D or better.

The 95th-percentile vehicle queues were reviewed to determine if any queues currently are
longer than available storage space. The review shows that the existing storage is sufficient
at all intersections except the South Samish Way/Lincoln Street intersection. The 95th-
percentile queue for the southbound right-turn movement at this location is approximately
520-feet, which exceeds the 200-foot turn pocket. With anticipated future growth in the study
area, the South Samish Way/Lincoln Street southbound right-turn queue is anticipated to
increase to 550-feet, which approaches the I-5 northbound on-ramp along Lincoln Street.

Traffic Safety
Collision records at the study intersections were reviewed to help identify existing traffic
safety issues. The most recent three-year period of collision data provided by the WSDOT is
for January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011. Table 4 provides a summary of the total and
average annual number of reported collisions as well as the collision rate for each study
intersection. The annual average of collisions is generally low and does not pose significant
safety issues.

                          Chapter 3. Project Impacts
This section of the report documents potential transportation impacts generated by the
proposed project on the surrounding street network and at study intersections. First,
estimated traffic volumes generated by the proposed site are distributed and assigned to
adjacent streets system. Next, project trips are added to future without-project traffic volumes
and any potential impacts to traffic operations, safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit are
identified. Site access operations are also discussed.

Trip Generation
Trip generation was calculated based on the average trip rate for a standard mid-rise
apartment (LU #223) from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th
Edition. The trip generation was also reduced by 7 percent to account for the site being in
close proximity to the Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride. This is a conservative approach as the
residential units will be marketed as student housing primarily for students attending WWU. It
is anticipated that the actual project will generate fewer vehicular trips than typical apartments
and what is accounted for in this analysis because the student population is more likely to
utilize transit, bike, or other non-vehicular modes of travel during the PM peak period. This is
driven by class schedules often end prior to the PM peak commute period, all WWU students
are provided Whatcom Transportation Authority (WTA) bus passes and parking fees on the
WWU campus are high. In addition, trip generation during summer months is anticipated to
be lower given that school will not be in session, which is not accounted for in this analysis.

The Lincoln Creek Park-and-Ride is within a 10-minute walk from the proposed student
apartments. The WTA's bus rapid transit (Go Line) provides service between the Lincoln
Creek Park-and-Ride and WWU.

Table 5 summarizes the trip generation estimates for the proposed project. The proposed
project would generate 640 daily trips with 59 auto trips during the weekday PM peak hour.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
Vehicular trip distribution for this project is based on existing travel patterns in the study area,
previous traffic studies in the area, and routes to and from WWU. Figure 5 illustrates the
project trip distribution during the PM peak period. As shown on the figure, 35 percent of
weekday PM peak hour site vehicular traffic is anticipated to travel to and from WWU via Bill
McDonald Parkway, 45 percent to and from I-5, 15 percent to and from Downtown, and 5
percent south of the site along Samish Way.

Net new project trips for the study period were assigned to the study intersections based on
the travel patterns. The resulting trip assignment is shown on Figure 5. The project trips were
added to the Future 2014 without project traffic volumes to form the basis of the traffic impact
analysis. Figure 6 shows the 2014 with-project traffic volumes at the study intersections.


Traffic Operations
Future 2014 with-project study intersection operations were evaluated for the weekday PM
peak hour. Intersection LOS was calculated using the method described previously. The
without-project conditions are compared to the with-project conditions to understand the
proposal traffic impacts. Table 6 summarizes the 2014 without- and with-project intersection
operations. LOS worksheets are included in Appendix C.

With the proposed project, all of the study intersections will continue to operate at LOS D or
better and operate at a similar LOS as without project conditions. The 95th-percentile vehicle
queues were reviewed to determine if the project would result in queues longer than available
storage space. Similar to the existing and future without-project conditions, the South Samish
Way/Lincoln Street southbound right-turn queue would exceed storage. The 95th-percentile
queue would be approximately 570-feet for the southbound right-turn movement. Like the
without-project conditions, this means that there is a five percent chance that during the
weekday PM peak hour the southbound right-turning traffic from the South Samish
Way/Lincoln Street intersection would block the northbound I-5 on-ramp along Lincoln Street.
The average or 50th percentile queue is approximately 340-feet; therefore, on average
queues are not anticipated to block the northbound on-ramp. As discussed previously, this is
an existing condition and the City is aware of this congestion.

Site Access Evaluation
Access is proposed along Consolidation Avenue on the southern property line. The driveway
is approximately 20-feet east of the Nevada Street/Consolidation Avenue intersection. The
site driveway will operate at LOS A during the PM peak hour, with eight seconds of delay.
With minimal queues, no conflicts are anticipated between the proposed driveway and the
Consolidation Avenue/Nevada Street intersection, and the proposed spacing would be
adequate.

           Chapter 4. Summary and Mitigation
As shown in the previous sections, all study intersections would meet the operational
standards defined by both the City of Bellingham and WSDOT. Based on this, no adverse
transportation impacts are anticipated. The project would be required to pay the City's Traffic
Impact Fee. The current fee is $1,925 per PM peak hour trip, which results in a preliminary
estimate of $113,575. Additional reductions in traffic impact fees are considered by the City
based on proximity to transit and other transportation demand management elements that
typically reduce the amount of traffic generated by a development. Given that the project will
be marketed as student housing with all WWU students having bus passes, reductions up to
50 percent are anticipated to account for the close proximity to high frequency transit. The
final impact fee will be calculated and approved by the City.

Appendix B:   LOS Definitions
Highway Capacity Manual, 2000

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying
several intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time.
Specifically, LOS criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified
time period (for example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on
many variables, including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the
intersection), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity.
Table 1 shows LOS criteria for signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity
Manual (Transportation Research Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

Table 1. Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections
    Level of        Average Control Delay           General Description
    Service               (sec/veh)                 (Signalized Intersections)
        A                      10                   Free Flow
        B                    >10 - 20               Stable Flow (slight delays)
        C                    >20 - 35               Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                           Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait
                             >35 - 55
                                                    through more than one signal cycle before proceeding)
        E                    >55 - 80               Unstable flow (intolerable delay)
        F                      >80                  Forced flow (jammed)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types:
all-way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS
is expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of
a signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a
two-way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual
movements, rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-
controlled intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total
average vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized
intersections (both all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

Transportation Technical Memorandum | October 2014   ii
NEW CARROLLTON AND LANDOVER YARDS IMPROVEMENTS EA

1.0       INTRODUCTION
The Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA), in coordination with the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA), is preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed New Carrollton Yard and
Landover Yard Improvements Project (“the project”). The EA is being prepared in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other federal, state and local laws and regulations.

This technical memorandum identifies the potential transportation effects of the No Build and Build Alternative
for the project. The memorandum describes the following:

         Project Alternatives
         Methodology
         Existing Conditions
         Environmental Consequences

The findings of this analysis will be incorporated into the EA.

1.1       Project Purpose and Need
The purpose of the project is to provide additional storage capacity and re-organize certain track maintenance
functions at WMATA’s rail yards.

1.2       Project Alternatives
The EA for the project will evaluate a No Build Alternative and a single Build Alternative. The Build Alternative
includes the same area improvements as the No Build Alternative in addition to construction and operation of
the project.

1.2.1         No Build Alternative
The No Build Alternative assumes that operations at New Carrollton Yard would continue, and that no
development would occur at the Landover site. In terms of the broader regional transportation network, the No
Build Alternative is defined as the existing highway and transit network and committed transportation
improvements from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board’s Financially Constrained Long
Range Plan (CLRP). No planned improvements would occur within the project area at New Carrollton Yard or at
the Landover site.
Under the No Build Alternative, WMATA would not be able to provide the necessary service and infrastructure
improvements as outlined in the Rail Fleet Management Plan (RFMP), Momentum, or the Eight-Car Train
Implementation Plan.
1.2.2         Build Alternative
The Build Alternative consists of the expansion of rail car storage capacity at New Carrollton Yard and
construction of a new rail yard adjacent to and east of the Landover Metrorail Station along with a new parking
structure. The proposed Landover Yard would provide storage and maintenance facilities for WMATA’s CTEM
division and TRST, which currently operate at New Carrollton Yard. As part of the project, the CTEM and TRST
functions would move from New Carrollton Yard to Landover Yard. The construction of CTEM and TRST facilities
at Landover Yard would precede the demolition of existing CTEM and TRST facilities at New Carrollton Yard.
Once CTEM and TRST functions are moved to Landover Yard, the resulting space at New Carrollton Yard would
be used to complete the expansion of facilities for rail car storage and equipment storage. The improvements at
each site are described individually below. The EA assumes the project would be operational by 2018 to meet
Metrorail system vehicle fleet expansion requirements needed by 2020.

Transportation Technical Memorandum | October 2014                                                               1

The Build Alternative also assumes the planned regional transportation improvements contained in the CLRP
that are part of the No Build Alternative.

New Carrollton Yard Improvements
 The existing New Carrollton rail yard (“New Carrollton Yard”) is approximately 36.8-acres in size and is located at
 4440 Garden City Drive in Landover, Maryland. The Build Alternative proposes to expand capacity at New
 Carrollton Yard through the construction of an additional 120 rail car storage spaces and support facilities. The
 existing Service and Inspection (S&I) and Yard Control Tower functions would remain unchanged.

The following facilities would be constructed within and adjacent to the existing New Carrollton Yard if the Build
Alternative is implemented:

        Fifteen storage tracks accommodating 120 rail cars:
              o Eight storage tracks accommodating 64 rail cars in the northwest corner of the yard (referred to as the
                  "northwest storage tracks");
              o Seven storage tracks accommodating 56 rail cars in the northeast corner of the yard (referred to as
                  the "northeast storage tracks");
              o Lead service tracks for the storage areas;
        One contractor storage track with access road in the southeast corner of the yard;
        Two maintenance-of-way (MOW) tracks;
        Reconfigured and expanded employee surface parking in the northern and eastern sections of the yard;
        New operations platform and a pedestrian bridge (connecting to the employee parking lot via an elevator/stair
         tower) serving the northwest storage tracks;
        Relocation of the existing control tower from the center of the yard to the top of the elevator/stair tower at
         the location of the pedestrian bridge. The relocated tower would be approximately 40 feet high;
        New operations building for the northeast storage tracks;
        Conversion of the existing Engineering Campaign building to a S&I building (building was originally built
         as a S&I building); and
        Conversion of an existing operations building to an Automatic Train Control (ATC) building and training
         facility.

WMATA would acquire adjacent property from Amtrak and Maryland Highway Administration (SHA) to
accommodate the rail yard expansion. New storage tracks would be constructed within the existing rail yard, as
well as on the Amtrak and SHA properties. The expanded facility would be approximately 39.5-acres in size. A
project concept is provided in Figure 1-1. The total number of existing and future employees at New Carrollton
Yard is summarized in Table 1-1.

Proposed Landover Yard
 The Landover Yard site, currently owned by WMATA, is approximately 18.7-acres in size and is located at 3000
 Pennsy Drive in Hyattsville, Maryland. Currently, the site is undeveloped, except for the two southern tracts,
 which contain surface Park & Ride lots serving the adjacent Landover Metrorail Station. The Build Alternative
 consists of the construction of a new rail yard, commuter parking garage, and support facilities for CTEM and
 TRST at the site. The new commuter parking garage would replace all Metrorail surface Park & Ride spaces
 removed for the project. Existing CTEM and TRST facilities would be moved from their current location at New
 Carrollton Yard to the proposed Landover Yard. Track maintenance vehicles of various sizes and function would
 be stored in and operate from the rail yard. No Metrorail passenger rail cars (revenue vehicles) would be stored
 at Landover Yard. Approximately 190 employees would be based at Landover Yard.

The following facilities would be constructed at Landover Yard if the Build Alternative is implemented:

          Loop track around the southern portion of the rail yard;
          Lead and tail tracks for the rail yard;
          New CTEM and TRST building and eleven storage tracks for track equipment and maintenance vehicles;
          Six-level commuter Park & Ride facility, consisting of 848-spaces to replace the surface spaces displaced by
           construction. The structure would be constructed on an existing commuter lot, south of the rail yard and
           separated from the new yard by the Landover Metro Access Road.
          Employee surface parking lot and delivery area in the southern portion of the proposed yard;
          New track crossover on the Metrorail revenue tracks;
          Retaining wall in the southwest corner would be constructed to accommodate the bypass track; and
          Stormwater management area at the northern end of the rail yard.

No property acquisition would be necessary for the project, as the rail yard would be built on land owned by
WMATA.

See Figure 1-2 for the project concept and Table 1-2 for a summary of existing and future employees at the
proposed rail yard.

2.0      METHODOLOGY
The methodology of this traffic impact study is based on the Transportation Review Guidelines 2012 developed
by Prince George’s County Planning Department and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning
Commission (M-NCPCC), as well as traffic impact study scoping meetings with M-NCPPC staff on January 31 and
April 21, 2014.

2.1      Data Collection
To evaluate the impact of site generated traffic on the roadway network, traffic field data including turning
movement counts and the existing roadway conditions, were gathered and reviewed. Turning movement
counts at New Carrollton and Landover were collected on Tuesday, February 25, 2014 and Wednesday April 30,
2014, respectively, during the AM peak period (6:00–10:00 am) and PM peak period (3:00–7:00 pm). The traffic
data used for this analysis is provided in Appendix B-1 of this report.

The study intersections include the access intersections to the New Carrollton and Landover Yards, and adjacent
intersections. Figure 2-1 shows the study area intersections. The seven study area intersections with the traffic
control types are listed below:

New Carrollton Yard Study Area Intersections
   1. Corporate Drive and Pennsy Drive (signalized)
   2. Garden City Drive and Corporate Drive (signalized)
   3. Garden City Drive and Metro Entrance (signalized)
   4. Garden City Drive and Metro Exit (unsignalized)

Landover Yard Study Area Intersections
   1. Pennsy Drive and Metro Access Road East (unsignalized)
   2. Pennsy Drive and Metro Access Road West (unsignalized)
   3. Landover Road and Old Landover Road (signalized)
The highest hourly volumes within the peak period were used for the traffic impact analysis. The data indicates
that AM peak hour is between 7:15-8:15 am for both sites, and PM peak hour is between 5:00-6:00 pm at New
Carrollton Yard and between 5:15-6:15 pm at Landover. Figure 2-2 shows the AM and PM turning movement
counts at study area intersections. See Appendix B-1 for the detailed traffic counts.

For Landover, parking utilization data was gathered from WMATA to evaluate temporary and permanent parking
impacts due to the removal and replacement of surface parking spaces.

2.2      Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions were assessed for both signalized and unsignalized intersections. The Critical Lane Volume
(CLV) method was used to measure the Level-of-Service (LOS) at signalized intersections. The CLV method was
used to understand the capacity of an intersection by aggregating the critical traffic volumes of critical
movements. The basic data required for the analysis includes hourly traffic volumes and intersection
geometrics. Table 2-1 defines the LOS corresponding to the computed CLV.

Traffic conditions at two-way stop controlled intersections were evaluated based on procedures in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM). If any movement exceeds a delay of 50 seconds and has hourly traffic volumes more
than 100 vehicles, the CLV method was used to supplement the HCM analysis. Table 2-2 shows the LOS criteria
for unsignalized intersections as defined in the HCM. Synchro was used to calculate the approach and
intersection delays in accordance with the HCM methodology.

2.3      Relevant Plans
2.3.1    New Carrollton Approved Transit District Development Plan and Transit District Overlay
Zoning Map Amendment (May 2010)
The plan proposes a transit-oriented mixed-use joint-development (including residential buildings, office
buildings and grocery/retail stores) to the south of the New Carrollton Metrorail Station. The new development
is expected to generate hundreds of vehicles on Garden City Drive and other corridors in the vicinity of the New
Carrollton Metrorail Station. However, as the joint-development project is still at the planning stage and the
available information about this project is limited at this point, this New Carrollton and Landover Yard study did
not include the potential new trips from the joint-development as part of 2018 background traffic. Additionally,
the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) model does not include the potential joint-
development at the New Carrollton Metrorail Station.

2.3.2  Landover Metro Area and MD 202 Corridor Adopted Sector Plan and Section Map
Amendment (May 2014)
The plan proposes mixed-use developments near the existing Landover Metrorail Station and corridors in the
vicinity of the site. Since the traffic impacts from this plan and built year of the developments are unknown at
this point, this New Carrollton and Landover Yard study did not include the new trips from this development
plan as part of 2018 background traffic. Additionally, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments
(MWCOG) model does not include the potential developments in the Landover Metro area and MD 202 corridor.

3.0       EXISTING CONDITIONS

3.1       2014 Existing Conditions
The CLV method was used for evaluating the four signalized intersections and the HCM method was used to
determine the LOS for the unsignalized intersections. Table 3-1 shows the summary of the analysis results of
existing traffic conditions. Detailed calculation sheets are shown in Appendix B-2 of this report.

All the intersections operate at LOS C or better in the existing traffic conditions, therefore no further CLV
analysis was required for the unsignalized intersections.

Table 3-2 shows the existing surface parking utilization at Landover Metrorail Station. Since 2011, parking
utilization has decreased every year at Landover Metrorail Station. The 2014 existing parking utilization at
Landover Metrorail Station is at 41%, meaning the surface parking has sufficient capacity to handle existing
parking demand.

The WMATA standard for providing access lanes is one ingress/egress lane for every 500 parking spots. Based on
the existing 1,866 parking spots provided at the Landover Metrorail Station, four entry and four exit lanes are
necessary. The current lane configurations for the two access roads at the Landover Metrorail Station are:

         West Access: 1 entry, 1 exit, 1 reversible
         East Access: 1 entry, 1 exit, 1 reversible

The existing configuration meets WMATA’s access requirements.

3.2       2018 No Build Alternative
The improvements to New Carrollton and Landover Yards are expected to be completed by 2018. Future traffic
conditions were estimated by applying an annual growth rate to existing traffic volumes. The traffic growth rate
from 2014 to 2018 was generated from the MWCOG model (Version 2.3.52). The MWCOG model reflects the

Transportation Technical Memorandum | October 2014                                                                         11

regional traffic change from the approved developments included in the National Capital Region’s Financially
Constrained Long-Range Transportation Plan (CLRP).

From 2014 to 2018, the MWCOG model indicated an annual traffic growth rate of 1.1% during the AM peak
period and 1.2% during the PM peak period at New Carrollton Yard. These annual growth rates lead to total
growth factors of 4.3% for the AM peak period and 4.7% for the PM peak period from 2014 to 2018. To be
conservative, this analysis assumes a total growth factor of 4.7% for both the AM and PM peak hour from 2014
to 2018 for the No Build Alternative traffic volumes at New Carrollton Yard.

At the Landover site, the MWCOG model indicated an annual growth rate of 3.2% during the AM peak period on
Pennsy Drive from 2014 to 2018. The growth rates on Pennsy Drive in the PM peak period and growth rates on
Landover Road in both AM and PM are negative. A comparison of the 2012 traffic counts to 2014 counts show a
similar growth pattern on Pennsy Drive for the past two years: 1) the annual growth rate in the AM peak period
is approximately 6.3% between 2012 and 2014; and 2) the annual growth rate in the PM peak period is negative
in the past two years. To be conservative, this analysis assumes an annual growth rate of 3.2% on Pennsy Drive
during the AM peak period (equivalent to a total growth of 13.3% from 2014 to 2018), and an annual growth
rate of 1% on Pennsy Drive during the PM peak period (equivalent to a total growth of 4.1% from 2014 to 2018).
The annual growth rate assumed for Landover Road is also 1% in both AM and PM peak periods. Figure 3-1
shows the projected peak hour traffic volumes for the 2018 No Build Alternative.

Table 3-3 shows the summary of the analysis results for 2018 No Build traffic conditions. Detailed calculation
sheets are documented in Appendix B-1 of this report.

For changes to parking utilization at Landover Metrorail Station, the 2018 No Build analysis assumes the
maximum conservative annual traffic growth rate of 4.1% from 2014 to 2018. Table 3-4 shows the summary of
the annual increases in parking utilization at Landover Metrorail Station from 2014 to 2018 for the 2018 No

4.0      ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

4.1      No Build Alternative
All the intersections in the 2018 No Build Alternative operate at LOS C or better. The intersections of Garden
City Drive and Corporate Drive and Landover Road and Old Landover Road downgrade from LOS B in the existing
condition to LOS C in the 2018 No Build Alternative during the AM peak hour due to growth in background
traffic, but the intersections still operate at acceptable LOS. No impact is anticipated to intersection operations
under the No Build Alternative since no additional employees are projected to be entering the site. No impacts
to parking capacity at Landover Metrorail Station are anticipated due to the low utilization of parking spaces.

4.2      Build Alternative
4.2.1         New Carrollton Yard
The improvements at New Carrollton Yard will increase the number of employees accessing the site; and thus
the number of trips entering and exiting the locations during the AM and PM peak hour will increase
accordingly. Table 1-1 provides the current and future number of employees working at New Carrollton Yard.

The existing number of employees working within New Carrollton Yard is 370, growing to 388 by 2025 (growth
rate of 4.9%). To be conservative, this analysis assumes the same number of employees within the yards in
2018. The analysis assumes the traffic volumes entering and exiting the yard are proportional to the number of
employees. The relation between existing traffic counts and number of employees at the current New
Carrollton Yard was used to estimate traffic volumes given the future number of employees. Table 4-1 shows
the traffic volume projection for New Carrollton Yard during the AM and PM peak periods. Figure 4-1 shows the
peak hour traffic volumes for New Carrollton Yard.

Improvements to New Carrollton Yard will generate an additional two entering trips and one exiting trip during
the AM peak hour, and one exiting trip during the PM peak hour. Table 4-2 shows the summary of the analysis
results for 2018 Build Alternative traffic conditions. Table 4-3 provides a comparative summary of traffic results
between the 2014 existing conditions, 2018 No Build Alternative, and 2018 Build Alternative. Detailed
calculation sheets are included in Appendix B-2 of this report.

The additional trips in the peak period result in all the intersections operating at LOS C or better in 2018 for the
Build Alternative. Overall, the traffic impacts from the development of New Carrollton Yard are minimal and no
impact to transportation is anticipated under the Build Alternative.

4.2.2          Landover Yard
The development of Landover Yard will increase the number of employees accessing the site; and thus the
number of trips entering and exiting the locations during the AM and PM peak hour will increase accordingly.
Table 1-2 provides the current and future number of employees working at Landover Yard.

The implementation of the project at Landover Yard will result in 190 employees working at the facility in 2025.
To be conservative, this analysis assumes the same number of employees within the yards in 2018. The analysis
assumes the traffic volumes entering and exiting the yard are proportional to the number of employees. The
relation between existing traffic counts and number of employees at the current New Carrollton Yard was used
to estimate traffic volumes given the future number of employees (since no current Landover maintenance
related employees exist). Table 4-1 shows the traffic volume projection for Landover Yard during the AM and
PM peak periods. Figure 4-1 shows the peak hour traffic volumes for Landover Yard.

The development of Landover Yard will generate 18 entering and 6 exiting trips during the AM peak hour, and
13 entering and 9 exiting trips during the PM peak hour. Table 4-2 shows the summary of the analysis results
for 2018 Build Alternative traffic conditions. Table 4-4 provides a comparative summary of traffic results
between the 2014 existing conditions, 2018 No Build Alternative, and 2018 Build Alternative. Detailed
calculation sheets are shown in Appendix B-2 of this report.

The additional trips in the peak period result in all the intersections operating at LOS C or better in 2018 for the
Build Alternative. Overall, the traffic impacts from the development of the Landover Yard are minimal and no
impact to transportation is anticipated under the Build Alternative.

Under the Build Alternative, no additional access roads into Landover Metrorail Station or Landover Yard are
required since the number of parking spaces provided is the same as the No Build Alternative. No additional
internal roadways or ingress/egress points are needed. The existing configuration meets WMATA’s access
requirements by providing 4 entry and 4 exit lanes.

Parking utilization at Landover Metrorail Station is anticipated to be the same as the 2018 No Build Alternative.
Under the 2018 Build Alternative, approximately 200 spots would be temporarily removed during the
construction of the commuter parking garage from 2016 to 2017. The construction of the commuter garage
would replace surface parking spaces removed for the commuter garage and subsequent CTEM and TRST
facilities at a 1:1 ratio. Even with a conservative growth in parking and the temporary removal of 200 parking
spaces during the construction period, Landover Metrorail Station has over double the parking capacity to meet
demand. Therefore, no impacts to commuter parking are anticipated temporarily or permanently by Landover
Yard.

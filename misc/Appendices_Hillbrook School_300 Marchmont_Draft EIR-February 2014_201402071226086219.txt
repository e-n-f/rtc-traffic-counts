     Attachment to the Notice of Preparation of a Focused Environmental Impact Report for the
                                        Town of Los Gatos
                                  300 Marchmont Drive U-12-002
PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The project applicant proposes to increase student enrollment from 315 to 414, modify operations of an
existing private school (Hillbrook School), and implement a Traffic Demand Management Plan. The
project proposes a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) modification to replace the existing CUP for Hillbrook
School. The CUP modification would also consider modification to conditions, including conditions
regarding the hours, frequency, and controls of afterschool, sports, nighttime, weekend, and activities and
programs. The use would comply with the conditions of approval established in the modified CUP. No
physical changes to the school campus would occur with the proposed CUP modification.

Project Location

The subject property is located at 300 Marchmont Drive, east of Los Gatos Boulevard and south of
Shannon Road. Figure 1 shows the project site's location. The property is located at the east end
terminus of Marchmont Drive. This access point serves as the primary access to the property. There is a
secondary access at the south end terminus of Ann Arbor Way. Currently, the secondary access is used
only for emergency access. Residential neighborhoods bound the property on all four sides ­ north,
south, east, and west.

Project Key Feature

An Initial Study was prepared in November 2012 and the public review period occurred from November
15 to December 5, 2012.1 The Initial Study determined that the following environmental issues would not
be significantly affected by the proposed project: air quality, aesthetics, agriculture and forestry resources,
biological resources, cultural resources, geology and soils, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and
hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use and planning, mineral resources, population
and housing, public services, recreation, transportation and traffic, and utilities and service systems. The
Initial Study also determined that the proposed project would not have a significant noise impact with
incorporation of the specified mitigation measure. However, based on comments received on the Initial
Study, the Town is requiring that a focused EIR be prepared on the following issues:

Air Quality: The focused EIR will evaluate the proposed project's consistency with applicable air
quality plans and evaluate project-specific air quality issues, including those related to traffic and
operation.

Greenhouse Gases: The focused EIR will evaluate the proposed project's contribution to greenhouse gas
emissions and its compliance with applicable GHG reduction strategies and goals.

Land Use and Planning: The focused EIR will evaluate the proposed project's consistency with the local
land use policies and regulations that have jurisdiction over the project.

Noise: The focused EIR will discuss noise compatibility of proposed uses and long-term noise impacts
due to operations.

1
  The Initial Study is available for review at the Los Gatos Community Development Department (located at 110 East Main
Street and available for review during counter hours from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., Monday through Friday) and online through the
Town's website: http://www.losgatosca.gov/Hillbrook.


                                                        Page 3 of 5
Transportation and Traffic: The focused EIR will evaluate the proposed project's impacts to traffic,
circulation, intersection operation, level of service, public transit, pedestrian and bicycle conditions, and
the residential environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS

Following completion of the 30-day Notice of Preparation public review period, the Town of Los Gatos
will incorporate relevant information into the Draft Focused EIR, including results of technical studies.
The Draft Focused EIR will be circulated for public review and comment for the required 45-day public
review period. All individuals and organizations that have requested notification, in writing, will be
placed on a Notice of Availability list for the Draft Focused EIR. In addition, the Draft Focused EIR and
related materials will be available for review on The Town of Los Gatos' website:
http://www.losgatosca.gov/hillbrook, at the Los Gatos Public Library (address above), and at the Town of
Los Gatos Community Development Department and Town Clerk Department, located at the 110 E. Main
Street, Los Gatos, CA 95030. Following receipt of all written comments on the Draft Focused EIR, the
Town of Los Gatos will prepare Responses to Comments as part of the Final Focused EIR, which will be
considered and acted upon by the Town of Los Gatos Planning Commission. The Town of Los Gatos
will provide notification of future public meetings for this project to individuals that have requested to be
included on the project interest list.

Should you have any questions or comments regarding this Notice of Preparation, please contact Jennifer
Savage, Associate Planner, Town of Los Gatos, at (408) 399-5702.

Pleasanton LOS Quality of Life Standards (Received
3/5/13)
Presents information from a San Francisco Bike Study       The NOP commenter specifically referenced quality of life standards set forth in the Pleasanton
document that references Pleasanton LOS guidelines.        Residential Street Level of Service guidelines included in the City's 2003 Baseline Traffic Report
                                                           and Table III-I of the Pleasanton General Plan. The following desirable level of service volumes were
                                                           listed, which closely matched the degree of concern expressed to staff regarding the quality of life
                                                           along residential streets and the relative need for traffic calming under these conditions: two-way
                                                           ADT of 500 on two-lane local streets; two-way ADT of 2,000 to 3,000 on two-lane neighborhood
                                                           streets; and two-way ADT of 6,000 to 9,000 on two-lane collector streets. This Residential Street
                                                           Level of Service standard also closely paralleled Pleasanton's General Plan Program 6.5, "Particular
                                                           sensitivity should be given to new development on streets which are projected to carry more than
                                                           2,000 average daily trips, and with existing houses which front such streets."
                                                           Average weekday counts taken on Marchmont Drive at the school entrance indicate traffic levels of
                                                           less than 900 ADT before the pilot TDM program and less than 800 ADT after the pilot TDM
                                                           program. Such levels would fall between Pleasanton's standard for a local street and a neighborhood

Problems with the Mitigated Negative Declaration that
continue to need to be addressed in the targeted EIR
(Received 3/5/13)
Commenter re-submits issues raised on the IS/MND        This EIR represents an expansion in the CEQA impact analysis that was included in the original
                                                        IS/MND, and replaces the IS/MND, which was never adopted by the Town. The project description
                                                        presented in Chapter 3 has been reorganized, expanded, and clarified per comments received on the
                                                        IS/MND and new traffic counts and additional traffic analysis was completed by TJKM also in
                                                        response to comments received on the IS/MND (see Appendices C and H).
Commenter re-submits comments on TDM Program            The Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan contains recommendations for various traffic
from Commenter (Attachment 1; DODSON-5A)                reduction measures. The deciding body may choose to make one or more of these measures
                                                        mandatory. Traffic trip counts could be used to determine the failure or success of the TDM plan
                                                        measures. The TIA Addendum (Appendix C of this EIR) shows a reduction in school-related trips
                                                        with implementation of some of the recommendations from the Transportation Demand Management
                                                        Plan.
                                                        The streets can accommodate the busses used by Hillbrook. Neither LGMSPD or the Engineering
                                                        Division found safety hazards associated with the bus stops.
                                                        Traffic count data for the entire day is presented in the appendices of the 2012 TIA (Appendix B),
                                                        and the 2013 TIA Addendum (Appendix C). The TIA Addendum (Appendix C) contains an
                                                        alternative method, TIRE, to evaluate traffic impacts on the neighborhood.
                                                        Industry standards for traffic studies call for analysis of a peak hour, such as 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. for
                                                        Hillbrook School. Hillbrook School has a condition in the existing CUP that defines the peak period
                                                        between 2:30 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. "Peak hour" versus "peak period" may be used in different
                                                        analyses. The traffic analyses in this EIR uses the "peak hour" for the industry standard traffic
                                                        analysis and uses the "peak period" for additional analysis specific to Hillbrook School.
                                                        Hillbrook School is not proposing to change nighttime activities. Hillbrook is not proposing to
                                                        change its activities with respect to renting/leasing but rather clarify who provides those activities
                                                        (i.e. an outside organization providing the service rather than Hillbrook staff). Traffic would not
                                                        change as a result. If renting/leasing of the campus, community use of Hillbrook facilities, and/or
                                                        non-Hillbrook person use is permitted, the uses could not exceed limitations of the CUP unless
                                                        further analysis was conducted.

Commenter re-submits comments on TDM Program             Streets near schools carry higher traffic volumes than similar streets that are not near schools. The
from Joseph J. and Sheila M. Sordi (Attachment 2;        TIA Addendum (Appendix C) contains an alternative method, TIRE, to evaluate traffic impacts on
DODSON-5B)                                               the neighborhood.
                                                         The traffic analyses for the proposed project account for traffic from additional staff. Hillbrook
                                                         School installed an electronic counter that is administered by a third party traffic consultant firm.
                                                         These counts can verify the number of trips over a longer period than the hose counts conducted by
                                                         the Town's traffic consultant.
                                                         The volume of traffic on the streets studied in the traffic analyses is below the standard for a local
                                                         street as set forth in the Town's Traffic Calming Policy.
                                                         The Traffic Demand Management (TDM) plan uses the "peak hour" for the industry standard traffic
                                                         analysis and uses the "peak period" for additional analysis specific to the Hillbrook School CUP
                                                         limitations. The TDM concludes that the TDM measures would result in an 18% trip reduction and
                                                         the deciding body may choose to make TDM measures mandatory (conditions of approval).

                                                         Table 3-1), the applicant proposes to continue the uses permitted in the existing CUP.

                                                         studied the major access intersections in the neighborhood and found all intersections operate at
                                                         acceptable levels of service (see Section 4.3, Transportation and Traffic, Appendix B, TIA, and
                                                         Appendix C, TIA Addendum).
                                                         LOS and capacity analysis would only be included for weekend activities if these activities generate
                                                         more intense traffic than weekday school traffic. The applicant is proposing to continue the weekend
                                                         uses permitted in the existing CUP (no changes). Based on accepted traffic engineering standards, if
                                                         weekend traffic is less than that of regular school day traffic, no additional analysis is required.
                                                         TJKM reviewed the study streets and concluded that they are safe with the amount of school bound
                                                         traffic, school buses, and school service-related vehicles. In addition, TJKM conducted an addendum
                                                         study to supplement the original traffic study to address quality of life concerns through an index
                                                         measure known as TIRE index (see Appendix C and Section 4.3.4, Other Traffic Considerations, of

                 Introduction and Summary

                 Introduction
                 This report presents the results of TJKM's traffic impact analysis for the proposed expansion of
                 Hillbrook School which is located at 300 Marchmont Drive in the Town of Los Gatos. The existing
                 Hillbrook School (a K-8 private school), is proposing an expansion of the school enrollment from the
                 current 315 students to 414 students, an increase in enrollment of 99 students. The school is not
                 expecting to build additional classrooms or buildings at the project site. The access to the school
                 site is via Marchmont Drive only and this roadway ends at the school entrance. Figure 1 illustrates
                 the project location and its vicinity. Figure 2 shows an aerial photo of the existing school site.

                 Summary
                 Based on the current school peak hour trip data, the proposed project expansion (an increase in
                 student enrollment by 99 students) is expected to generate 98 a.m. peak hour trips (53 inbound
                 trips and 45 outbound trips) and 84 school p.m. peak hour trips (42 inbound trips and 42 outbound
                 trips) in addition to the existing trip counts.

                 Currently, all study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service during the a.m. peak hour
                 and the school p.m. peak hour (LOS D or better).

                 All the study intersections are expected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS
                 D or better) for the Existing plus Approved, Existing plus Project, Background (Existing +
                 Approved) plus Project and Background (Existing + Approved) plus Project plus Pending Conditions
                 scenarios.

                 Based on queuing analysis, the vehicle accumulation of drop-off/pick-up activity is expected to be
                 contained within the school site during both a.m. and p.m. school peak hours with the proposed
                 increase in school enrollment.

                 The following are the recommended traffic improvement measures for the proposed project:
                     ·    TJKM recommends that the project applicant prepare and implement a more thorough,
                          aggressive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan to improve the current
                          procedures as specified in the "Hillbrook School Handbook". Some of the TDM measures
                          may include proactive plans to encourage carpooling and transit use, including strong
                          incentives, staggered drop-off/pick-up schedules for students, etc.
                     ·    The intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue is timed and
                          coordinated with the intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Shannon Road. With additional
                          trips from the project, these two signals should be re-timed to maximize the efficiency of
                          signal coordination.

                     1. Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue (Signalized)
                     2. Los Gatos Boulevard/Shannon Road (Signalized)
                     3. Shannon Road/Englewood Avenue (One-way Stop Control)
                     4. Englewood Avenue/Marchmont Drive (One-way Stop Control)
                     5. Englewood Avenue/Kennedy Road (All-way Stop Control)
                     6. Shannon Road/Hilow Road (Two-way Stop Control)
                     7. Marchmont Drive/Hilow Road (All-way Stop Control)

                 The following five scenarios were addressed in this study:
                    1. Existing Conditions ­ Current (Year 2011) traffic volumes and roadway conditions.
                    2. Existing plus Approved (Background) Conditions ­ Current (Year 2011) traffic volumes and
                         roadway conditions with the addition of traffic from approved developments within the
                         Town of Los Gatos.
                    3. Exiting plus Project Conditions ­ Current (Year 2011) traffic volumes and roadway
                         conditions with traffic added just from the proposed project expansion.
                    4. Background plus Project Conditions ­ Identical to Background Conditions, but with traffic
                         added from the proposed project expansion.
                    5. Background plus Project plus Pending Conditions ­ Identical to Background plus Project
                         Conditions, except for additional (forecasted) traffic from future pending projects within
                         the Town of Los Gatos.

                 Level of Service Analysis Methodology
                 The operating conditions at all the study intersections were evaluated using the 2000 Highway
                 Capacity Manual (HCM) Operations Method contained in TRAFFIX software. The default
                 saturation flow rates were adjusted to comply with the Congestion Management Program (CMP)
                 methodology, adopted by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). Peak hour
                 intersection conditions are reported as average delay in seconds per vehicle with corresponding
                 levels of service (LOS). A level of service ratings is qualitative descriptions of intersection
                 operations and is reported using an A through F letter rating system to describe travel delay and
                 congestion. Level of Service A indicates free flow conditions with little or no delay and LOS F
                 indicates jammed conditions with excessive delays and long back-ups. The methodology is
                 described in detail in Appendix A.

                 Significant Impact Criteria
                 The Town's level of service standard is LOS D. Intersections that fall below LOS D are considered
                 impacted and should be considered for mitigation. Also, the proposed project is considered to
                 have a significant impact if it causes the levels of service for the study intersections to drop more
                 than one level if it is at LOS A, B, or C, and drop any further if it is at D or worse.

                 Existing Traffic Conditions

                 Level of Service Analysis
                 Peak hour turning movement counts at the study intersections were conducted in May2011 when
                 the Hillbrook School was in regular session. Based on the traffic counts, the school's peak hours
                 are morning peak from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and afternoon school peak from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
                 Raw traffic counts and 85th percentile speed data are provided in Appendix B. Figure 3 illustrates
                 the existing lane geometry, traffic control, and the peak hour turning movement volumes at the
                 study intersections. A graphic illustrating a summary of average daily traffic (ADT) counts is
                 provided in Appendix B. Table I summarizes the results of the intersection analysis under Existing
                 Conditions. The detailed LOS calculations (TRAFFIX Output) are contained in Appendix C.

                 Under the Existing Conditions, all study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service
                 (LOS D or better). During the a.m. peak hour, the intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/
                 Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue operates at LOS D with noticeable vehicle queuing on both
                 Los Gatos Boulevard and Kennedy Road. The congestion due to queuing is particularly visible
                 during the peak 15-minute interval of the school peak periods. Currently, the signal at this
                 intersection is timed and coordinated with the intersection of Los Gatos Boulevard/Shannon Road.
                 With additional trips from the project, these signals should be re-timed to maximize the efficiency
                 of signal coordination.

                 At the Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue intersection, TJKM staff observed a
                 queue length of approximately 19 vehicles on Kennedy Road during a peak 15-minute interval of
                 the a.m. peak hour. This observed queue length is within the range of the 85th-percentile queue
                 length as reported in the detailed LOS calculations in Appendix C.

                 Roadway Conditions on Marchmont Drive
                 Currently, Marchmont Drive/Hilow Road, a gateway intersection to the school site, is a four-legged
                 unsignalized intersection with an all-way stop control. Marchmont Drive runs in the east-west
                 direction and Hilow Road runs in the north-south direction. Marchmont Drive is a two-lane
                 roadway with a posted speed limit of 25 mph between Englewood Avenue and Hilow Road and
                 15 mph between Hilow Road and the school entrance.

                 During the a.m. and the school p.m. peak periods, the queuing conditions were observed at the
                 critical study intersections. TJKM staff performed peak hour queue and delay studies at Marchmont
                 Drive/Hilow Road intersection. Based on the field studies, during the a.m. peak hour, the average
                 stop delay is approximately ten seconds per vehicle with a maximum observed queue of two
                 vehicles. It should be noted that these field observations are in same range as the HCM analysis
                 results and they are shown in Appendix C.

                 The capacity for a roadway is governed by a traffic control device (such as a stop sign or a traffic
                 signal) at an intersection, where a vehicle has to stop/wait for its turn. The first Stop control for
                 Marchmont Drive outside the school gate is at Hilow Road and currently the overall average
                 intersection delay is at 7.9 seconds (LOS A) during both the a.m. and the school p.m. peak hour
                 conditions.

                 85th Percentile Speed on Study Roadways
                 The speed at (or below) which 85 percent of the vehicles are observed to travel under free flowing
                 conditions on a roadway is termed as 85th percentile speed. TJKM collected machine count data
                 and 85th percentile speed data for six study locations and the speed data is summarized as shown in
                 Table II. In general, the 85th percentile speed for the study roadways is well within acceptable limits
                 per State of California standards for setting speed limits. Addition of the project trips along the
                 roadways is not expected to cause higher travel speeds.

                 Existing plus Approved (Background) Conditions
                 This Scenario is similar to Existing Conditions, but with the addition of traffic from the approved
                 developments within the site vicinity. Approved projects consist of developments that are either
                 under construction, are built but not fully occupied, or that are not built but have final development
                 approval from the Town.

                 Based on recent communication with the Town staff, the following eighteen approved projects are
                 expected to generate some traffic through the study intersections:
                     1. 15940 Blossom Hill Road (residential)
                     2. 15881 Linda Avenue (residential)
                     3. 371 Los Gatos Boulevard (residential)
                     4. 55 Los Gatos Saratoga (retail/office)
                     5. 15720 Winchester Boulevard (office development replaces a single-family home)
                     6. 14881 National Avenue (medical office development replaces a single-family home)
                     7. 15400 Los Gatos Boulevard (office/retail)
                     8. 16005 Los Gatos Boulevard (mixed-use)
                     9. 950 University Avenue (self-storage)
                     10. 15928 Union Avenue (residential)
                     11. Samaritan Way (medical office)
                     12. Town Library (new library replaces the existing library)
                     13. 55 Placer Oaks (single-family housing)
                     14. 16213 Los Gatos Boulevard (residential replaces auto dealership)
                     15. 800 Blossom Hill Road (senior adult residential)
                     16. Albright Way Development (office and residential)
                     17. 930 University Avenue (soccer complex)
                     18. 106 Town Terrace (single family residential)

                 These projects are expected to add a total of 1,196 vehicular trips during the commute a.m. peak
                 hour and 921 trips during the school p.m. peak hour in the Town of Los Gatos street network.

                 Level of Service Analysis (Existing plus Approved (Background) Developments)
                 Figure 4 illustrates the Existing plus Approved turning movement volumes and Table III summarizes
                 the results of the intersection analysis. The detailed LOS calculations are contained in Appendix D.

                 Based on the traffic analysis, the increase in average delay at the study intersections is limited (less
                 than three seconds of average delay). Under this scenario, all study intersections are expected to
                 continue to operate at acceptable conditions (LOS D or better).

                 Project Conditions Analysis

                 Existing plus Project Conditions
                 This Scenario is identical to the Existing Conditions, but with added traffic from the proposed
                 project expansion of Hillbrook School.

                 The existing Hillbrook School (a K-8 private school), is proposing an expansion of the school
                 enrollment from the current 315 students to 414 students, an increase of 99 students. The school
                 is not expecting to build additional classrooms or buildings at the project site. The access to the
                 school site is via Marchmont Drive only and this roadway ends at the school entrance.

                 TJKM reviewed Hillbrook School Handbook that provides detailed information on the current
                 procedures on carpooling, shuttle service, traffic and parking, student drop-off and pick up etc.
                 Based on this document, it is noted that the afternoon school peak has a staggered dismissal
                 schedule to alleviate the traffic queuing issues. Junior Kindergarten and Kindergarten classes are
                 dismissed at 2:45 p.m. and the parents are required to pick up their children by 3:00 p.m. Grades
                 one through four are dismissed at 3:00 p.m. and the parents are required to pick up their children
                 by 3:15 p.m. Similarly, grades five through eight are dismissed at 3:15 p.m. and the students are
                 required to be picked up by 3:30 p.m.

                 Project Trip Generation
                 The trip generation for the current land use, a K-8 private school estimated based on rates provided
                 in Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
                 are compared with the traffic counts conducted at the school entrance. Table IV shows the
                 summary of comparison between ITE based trip rates and the observed peak hour trip counts.

                              2008.

                 TJKM conducted a week-long hose counts for Marchmont Drive near the school gate during May
                 2011 and the trip counts shown on Table IV are for the highest day of the study week. TJKM
                 estimated the proposed project trips by extrapolating the five-year average (historical) counts (See
                 tail end of Appendix B for historical counts). This results in a higher number of a.m. peak hour and
                 school p.m. peak hour trips than the ITE peak hour trip rates. Table V shows the summary of
                 project trip generation estimates for the a.m. and the school p.m. peak hours.

                 The proposed project expansion (an increase in student enrollment by 99 students) is expected to
                 generate 98 a.m. peak hour trips (53 inbound trips and 45 outbound trips) and 84 school p.m.
                 peak hour trips (42 inbound trips and 42 outbound trips) in addition to the existing trip counts.

                              Projected counts were used to assign project trips at the study intersections for traffic analysis.

                 License Plate Survey
                 A license plate survey was conducted to obtain travel route information of Hillbrook School bound
                 trips within the study neighborhood streets. In this survey method, travel route information was
                 obtained by stationing one or more observers at each entrance and exit of the study area to record
                 the time and license plate information of each vehicle as it passes the observation station. The
                 license plate numbers are matched later and the travel route/time information for the study
                 roadways are summarized. Generally, video cameras and notepads are used to record the license
                 plate survey data.

                 As part of the project, TJKM and Quality Counts (traffic data collection firm/sub-consultant) were
                 tasked with collecting the license plate data during the regular a.m. and the school p.m. peak hours
                 at the following nine locations:
                     ·    Marchmont Drive west of Hillbrook School Entrance
                     ·    Ferris Avenue south of Loma Street
                     ·    Englewood Avenue north of Kennedy Road
                     ·    Marchmont Drive east of Englewood Avenue
                     ·    Stonybrook Drive north of Kennedy Road
                     ·    Kennedy Road east of Stonybrook Drive
                     ·    Englewood Avenue south of Shannon Road
                     ·    Hilow Road south of Shannon Road
                     ·    Shannon Road west of Bonnie Lane

                 The license plate data includes the license plate numbers, color of the vehicles, type of the vehicle
                 and the time stamp of the inbound and the outbound vehicles at each of the survey locations. The
                 raw data was thus processed to track the peak hour inbound and the outbound trip movement
                 along the study road segments. The summarized license plate survey data in combination with the
                 peak hour turn movement counts was used to determine existing school traffic travel patterns to
                 help assign the project trips to the study intersections. The summarized license plate survey results
                 are provided in Appendix E of this report.

                 Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
                 Trip distribution assumptions for the proposed project were developed based on existing travel
                 patterns, license plate survey data, knowledge of the study area and the input from Town staff.
                 Traffic from the proposed project is expected to travel to and from the site according to the
                 distribution assumptions shown on Figure 5 and described below:
                     ·    20 percent will travel to/from the north via Winchester Boulevard
                     ·    10 percent will travel to/from the west via Los Gatos Saratoga Road (Highway 9)

                                                                                                                              Page 13

                     ·      20 percent will travel to/from north via SR 17
                     ·      5 percent will travel to/from south via SR 17
                     ·      20 percent will travel to/from the north via Los Gatos Boulevard
                     ·      25 percent will travel to/from the south via Los Gatos Boulevard

                 As the proposed project school-bound trips converge into the study neighborhood streets, the
                 trips were manually distributed for each of the streets and study intersections using the
                 summarized results from License plate survey and the turn movement counts.

                 Traffic Impacts on Neighborhood Streets
                 As shown on Figure 5, the proposed project trips are expected to reach the project site located at
                 300 Marchmont Drive via local residential streets bordered by Los Gatos Blvd, Shannon Road, and
                 Kennedy Road. Among these local residential streets, Marchmont Drive, Hilow Road, and Englewood
                 Avenue are expected to carry majority of the school traffic. Based on the peak hour traffic analysis,
                 the study neighborhood streets and the intersections level of service are expected to remain well
                 within acceptable levels with the proposed increase in school enrollment as shown in Table VI.

                 Level of Service Analysis
                 Figure 6 illustrates the Existing plus Project turning movement volumes. The results of the LOS
                 analysis are summarized in Table VI and detailed calculations are provided in Appendix F. With the
                 addition of project trips, all the study intersections are expected to operate at essentially the same
                 level of service as Background Conditions but with slight increases in average delay at each of the
                 study intersections.

                 Based on the traffic analysis for this scenario, the addition of the project trips at the intersection of
                 Los Gatos Boulevard/Kennedy Road/Caldwell Avenue is expected to increase the westbound
                 approach queue by one vehicle length during the a.m. peak hour. Similarly, the addition of project
                 trips at the all-way stop control intersection of Marchmont Drive/Hilow Road is expected to
                 increase the queue length by no more than one vehicle at any approach.

                 Pedestrian, Bicycle and Transit Accessibility




                 Hillbrook School currently provides private shuttle service (Durham School Services) for its students
                 on two routes serving Los Altos, Cupertino, Saratoga, Rose Garden, Willow Glen and segments of
                 greater San Jose. The above graphic illustrates the path of the bus routes that serve an approximate
                 total of 50 students as of spring 2011. The school management informed the Town staff that they
                 started the shuttle service as part of new TDM (Transportation Demand Management) program for
                 the year 2010-2011 and they plan to add additional bus routes in the near future to improve their
                 commitment towards TDM measures which aims at reducing school peak hour trips.

                 Currently, there are sidewalks along Los Gatos Boulevard on both sides. There are no sidewalks
                 along the study road segments to the east side of Los Gatos Boulevard near project site and
                 along Marchmont Drive. Currently, the school bound students either walk or bike along
                 Marchmont Drive share the roadway with the traveling vehicles. There are Class II bike lanes
                 along Los Gatos Boulevard in the study area.

                 Based on field observations, Bus Route 49 runs along Los Gatos Boulevard in the vicinity of the
                 project site. Bus Route 49 operates between the Winchester Transit Center and the Los Gatos
                 Civic Center. The nearest bus stops for Bus Route 49 are located on Los Gatos Boulevard at both
                 Shannon Road and Kennedy Road. This project is not expected to cause any significant impact on
                 the transit system in the vicinity.

                 Collision Analysis
                 TJKM reviewed the SWITRS collision reports for the school traffic routes within the local
                 neighborhood streets including Englewood Avenue, Marchmont Drive, Hilow Road, and Topping
                 Way. The collision reports are provided by Town staff for the two-year period of June 2008
                 through May 2010. Only one accident at the Englewood/Kennedy intersection was reported within
                 the reviewed period. Based on the estimated trip rate numbers, the proposed project is expected
                 to have little or no impact on the collision rate (or safety) at the study segments and study
                 intersections.

                         DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Alternatives            Two alternatives were considered:
Considered:                No Action: The existing facilities are deficient in capacity
                               and not in compliance with environmental regulations.
                           Preferred Alternative: Conceptual plan alternatives were
                               developed. The consultant team synthesized the plans and
                               prepared the Ultimate Site Plan, the plan subject to this
                               environmental assessment.

Potential Impacts and   The Camp Püpükea Master Plan will improve existing facilities,
Mitigation Measures:    address facility deficiencies, and have beneficial impacts by creating
                        safer conditions and improved indoor and outdoor facilities for Boy
                        Scout programs. The potential adverse impacts, while minimal can
                        be mitigated:
                             Short-term construction impacts to air quality, noise, solid
                               waste generation, storm water quality/quantity are
                               anticipated. The project will address these impacts through
                               compliance with County, State and Federal rules, regulations,
                               permit and variance requirements regarding fugitive dust,
                               community noise control, and non-point source discharges.
                               In addition, best management practices that include structural
                               and non-structural controls designed to inhibit run-off,
                               erosion, fugitive dust will be implemented.
                             Long-term potential impacts to storm water quality/quantity
                               are anticipated if not addressed within the project design. To
                               reduce storm water quality/quantity impacts the Master Plan
                               will maintain natural drainage as much as possible and use
                               pervious pavement to ensure storm water quality/quantity is
                               not increased or degraded.
                         The Project is not anticipated to impact species listed by the U.S.
                         Fish and Wildlife Service as Threatened or Endangered or their
                         habitat, wetlands, or any known archaeological or cultural
                         resources. The site is not located within agricultural zoned lands,
                         nor within flood or tsunami zones.

Anticipated             Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
Determination:

2.1       BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Aloha Council Boy Scouts of America (Boy Scouts)

It is the vision of the Boy Scouts to be recognized by people in the communities they serve as the
premier youth organization in Hawai‘i and throughout the Pacific by carrying out the mission of
the Boy Scouts of America. The Boy Scouts’ mission is to prepare young people to make ethical
and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.
The outcomes of Scouting have a dynamic, positive effect on the youth, leaders, and families
they serve and help build stronger communities with more caring citizens.

The Boy Scouts of America, Aloha Council serves over 12,960 registered Scouts in over 684
Cub Scout Packs, Boy Scout Troops, Varsity Scout teams, Venture Crews, Explorer Posts, and
Learning for Life groups sponsored by 360 businesses, churches, schools, and community
service organizations. Over 4,946 dedicated volunteers and a professional staff of 16 deliver
high-quality Scouting programs.

The Boy Scouts of America has a long history of helping to shape and mold the values and
character of youth. According to the Scout Law, scouts are trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly,
courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. The Boy Scouts continue
to help strengthen youth, families, and communities through comprehensive programs for its
members. Boy Scouts empower boys by giving them useful roles in their communities and
encouraging them to serve others. Scouting’s core values of faith in God, personal integrity, and
patriotism are conveyed to members at all activities. Every Scouting activity focuses on
nurturing the six critical elements of healthy youth development:

         Strong personal values and character
         Positive sense of self-worth and usefulness
         Caring and nurturing relationships with parents, other adults, and peers
         A desire to learn
         Productive/creative use of time
         Social adeptness

As Boy Scouts leaders reinforce positive behavior in each of these six areas, they prepare youth
to face the challenging and complicated issues of today’s society. For over a century, the BSA
has helped build future leaders by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun.
The Boy Scouts believe — and, through over a century of experience, knows — that helping
youth is a key to building a more conscientious, responsible, and productive society.

Camp Püpükea

In 1927, the U.S. Army acquired the Camp Püpükea site via a Presidential Executive Order. The
U.S. military used the land to build the Püpükea Military Reservation, including Püpükea Battery
Emplacements 1 and 2, which were part of the U.S. Army Fleet Defense System. The Camp
remained active until the end of World War II. In 1953, another Presidential Executive Order
returned Camp Püpükea to the Territory of Hawai‘i.

Camp Püpükea has been used by the Boy Scouts for overnight camping and recreational use
since the early 1960s. This former military training area is the largest and busiest Boy Scout
activity center in the Pacific. Its summer camp program plays host to troops from throughout
Hawaiÿi and the United States Mainland. The camp operates year-round, with events varying
depending on the season:

      Summer – Scout Summer Camp (June to August)
      Fall – individual unit camps and Camporees (held on weekends)
      Christmas – Scout Winter Camp (one week)
      Winter/Spring – individual unit camps and our Scouting Outreach groups

2.1.1 Location and Property Description

Camp Püpükea is located on Oÿahu’s North Shore, approximately three miles from Waimea, atop
the slopes of the Koÿolau Mountain Range, Püpükea ahupua‘a, Ko‘olauloa District (Figure 1).
The Camp Püpükea site encompasses approximately 64.8 acres identified as TMKs 5-9-05:002
and 5-9-05:077 (Figure 2). The two parcels are bisected by a remnant State parcel.

The site is triangular in shape, bound by Pūpūkea Road to the south, the Kahuku Training Area
to the north northwest, and the Pūpūkea-Paumalu Homesteads and the Pūpūkea-Paumalu State
Park Reserve to the west.

Camp Püpükea is comprised of various cabins, campsites and outdoor physical fitness and
recreational facilities. Figure 3 contains site photographs and Figure 4 contains a map of the
camp showing existing buildings and facilities.

Päkülena Stream and Kälunawaikaÿala Stream both originate within the boundaries of Camp
Püpükea and continue makai of the property in its natural state.

Vegetation within Camp Püpükea is dominated by non-native species consisting mainly of
Swamp mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta) and strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum). The camp
is densely forested except for clearings around camp facilities.

2.2   PURPOSE AND NEED

The Camp Püpükea Master Plan will: 1) provide much needed infrastructure improvements for
the campgrounds; and 2) provide more adequate camp facilities for the Boy Scouts’ training and
leadership programs.

Infrastructure Improvements

Camp Püpükea is in need of an updated wastewater system. Currently, camp toilet facilities are
provided with portable toilets (porta-potties) as a temporary method of complying with the
EPA’s 2005 regulations requiring the closure of large capacity cesspools (LCCs). Previously, the
camp had latrines with wastewater disposal handled by 12 LCCs. As of February 2012, 11 LCCs
were still in operation at Camp Püpükea. By June 2012, the Boy Scouts had submitted a
preliminary work plan to the State of Hawai‘i Department of Health to upgrade their wastewater
system. It was at this time that the latrines were boarded to make them inaccessible and the
porta-potties were installed to minimize the impact to the environment until an approved
wastewater system can be constructed.

Camp Programs and Facilities

New facilities and additional campgrounds are needed for the Boy Scouts expanding programs
and members. These new facilities will be located primarily in the south west portion of the
camp. Some of the existing structures will need to be renovated or relocated on-site.

2.3   THE BOY SCOUTS’ CAMP PŪPŪKEA MASTER PLAN

The Boy Scouts are proposing to provide various improvements at Camp Püpükea. Upgrades
include infrastructure improvements (particularly wastewater improvements to eliminate the use
of portable toilets), renovation or relocation of some existing structures, and new facilities. As
part of the Camp Püpükea Master Plan the Boy Scouts also propose to acquire the remnant State
parcel that bisects the property by either land purchase or land exchange with the State of
Hawai‘i. The Boy Scouts will pursue the appropriate action in consultation with DLNR, Land
Division.

Improvements are expected to be completed in three phases over a period of 20 or more years.
The proposed action includes the following elements (collectively referred to as “Camp Püpükea
Master Plan”):

Phase I

Phase I (Figure 9A) will see infrastructure and other improvements including:

          Water system improvements
          Electrical system improvements
          A junior staff lodging and family cabins complex consisting of five clusters of three
           cabins each.
          Fire sprinkler system improvements for the family camp area
          A widened camp access road that will also provide fire protection access
          An improved parking area at the entrance to the camp with space for 40 vehicles

The most significant improvement in Phase I will be the construction of five new shower and
bathroom facilities (“comfort stations”) with individual wastewater systems to replace the
existing shower facilities and portable toilets. Each comfort station’s wastewater system will
include four 1,500-gallon IAPMO1-approved septic tanks, one 1,250-gallon pre-loader, and one
absorption bed.

On November 7, 2012, the State of Hawai‘i Department of Health approved the Boy Scouts’
twenty Individual Wastewater System Applications, authorizing the installation of the septic
tanks and associated infrastructure. The total estimated wastewater flow of the 20 septic tanks is
approximately 20,000 gallons per day. The 12 existing large capacity cesspools will also be
formally closed and a Cesspool Closure and Backfilling Report will be submitted to both EPA
and the State Department of Health. Some of the cesspools appear to be injection-well cesspools,
and therefore, the Boy Scouts will obtain authorization and instructions from the Health
Department’s Underground Injection Control program to properly abandon those cesspools.

Phase II

Phase II improvements (Figure 9B) are more mid-range in nature and are proposed to include:

          Upgrades to the Camp Director’s Cabin and Ranger’s House.
          Renovation and relocation of the Scout Leader meeting lounge, Chapel, and Health
           Lodge
          Expansion of the trading post
          A new Welcome Center
          New multi-use pavilions

         A new Indigenous Studies facility
         Relocation of the archery range and rifle range, craft pavilion, climbing and zip line
          center (COPE facility)

Phase III

Phase III improvements (Figure 9C) are long-range in nature and will depend on the availability
of funding. Phase III improvements include new programs, facilities, and additional
campgrounds primarily in the south west portion of the camp, including:

         A new facility for Natural Science and Environmental Education
         Additional campground areas
         A mountain bike path
         Additional parking areas

2.4       SUSTAINALBE PLANNING AND DESIGN

In the design and construction of the Camp Püpükea Master Plan, the architect will implement
feasible measures to promote energy conservation and environmental stewardship, such as
standards and guidelines promulgated by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC),
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other similar programs.
Sustainable design practices will be incorporated as applicable, including consideration for the
following:

         Buildings to take advantage of natural light, ventilation, and trade winds.
         Manage and divert storm water on site to reduce flooding and runoff.
         Provide ADA access as required.
         Plan for and design social gathering spaces.
         Provide a system of pedestrian paths.
         Make room for composting on site.
         Provide motion sensor lighting.

2.5       DEVELOPMENT TIMETABLE AND PRELIMINARY COSTS

Construction of the Püpükea Master Plan will commence following the receipt of required
approvals and permits, including a CDUP. It is estimated that Phase 1 will be completed by
2017, Phase 2 by 2020, and Phase 3 by 2030 or later.

The total anticipated cost for Phase 1 is $6 million, $4 million for Phase 2, and $4 million for
Phase 3. The estimated costs include site development costs, landscaping costs, and buildings
costs.

       3    DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT,
           POTENTIAL IMPACTS, AND MITIGATION MEASURES
3.1    CLIMATE

Climate throughout the North Shore region is generally mild. Temperatures range between a high
of 84 degrees to a low of 64 degrees Fahrenheit(F), with an annual mean temperature of 75
degrees F. Historically, the warm season occurs from June to October and is followed by the
colder season between December to March. Climate variance is low due to prevailing ocean-born
trade winds. The region lies more or less perpendicular to the flow of these winds, and annual
wind speed ranges between 12 to 14 mph. Precipitation on the North Shore is moderate. Mean
annual rainfall in the area amounts to 62 inches with each month seeing at least three inches.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The Camp Püpükea improvements are not expected to have a significant impact on the region’s
climate, and no mitigation measures are warranted or planned.

3.2    GEOLOGY & TOPOGRAPHY

Camp Püpükea is situated along the top of Kaleleiki Gulch. Elevations range from approximately
850 feet above mean sea level at the makai end, up to 970 feet at the mauka end of the camp.
Average slope is approximately six percent in an east-west, mauka to makai direction.

The camp also rests adjacent to the northeastern base of the Ko‘olau Volcano. The hilly
topography of the northeastern ridges were thought to have been the result of a giant landslide
causing destruction of the eastern flank of the Ko‘olau shield. However, further study suggests
that a combination of stream and wave erosion may have caused removal of the flank of the
Ko‘olau shield. The resulting rifts have formed natural drainage systems within the Ko‘olau
Range and the interior drains entirely north. Considerable canyons have taken form such as the
nearby Waimea Bay with a depth of 400 feet. The mountainous region lies above Pliocene-age
Ko‘olau Basalt and is the most widespread geologic unit exposed on O‘ahu.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The upgrades to Camp Püpükea are not expected to significantly impact the topographic nature
of the site relative to the surrounding lands; therefore, no mitigation measures are planned. Any
grading necessary will be kept to a minimum to maintain the existing natural state as much as
possible and to keep adjacent lands undisturbed. Clearing and grading will be necessary for the
shower/comfort station buildings, leach fields for the individual wastewater systems, the junior
staff lodging and family cabins complex, and other improvements in subsequent phases. New

buildings in the junior staff lodging and family cabins complex will be of post and pier
construction that will not require grading under the floor.

3.3    SOILS

Three soil suitability studies prepared for lands in Hawaiÿi describe the physical attributes of land
and the relative productivity of different land types for agricultural production; these are: 1) the
U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey; 2)
the University of Hawaiÿi Land Study Bureau (LSB) Detailed Land Classification; and 3) the
State Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Lands of Importance to the State of Hawaiÿi
(ALISH). The three soil suitability studies are discussed below.

Natural Resource Conservation Service Soil Survey

The Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Soil Survey of the Islands of Kauai, O‘ahu,
Maui, Molokai, and Lanai, State of Hawai‘i (1972) classifies the soil of the Camp Püpükea site
as Pa‘aloa silty clay, Helemano silty clay, Kapaÿa silty clay, and Paumalü-Badland complex
(Figure 10).

Pa‘aloa silty clay, 3 to 12 percent slopes, occurs on uplands at elevations ranging from just below
the steeply sloping, deeply dissected areas covered by rain forest. Vegetation is ÿöhiÿa, koa,
guava, fern, and California grass. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is slow to medium,
and the erosion hazard is slight to moderate. This soil is generally used for pasture and
sugarcane.

Helemano silty clay, 30 to 90 percent slopes, occurs in deep gulches and drainage ways.
Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is medium to very rapid, and erosion hazard is severe
to very severe. This soil is generally used for pasture, woodland and wildlife habitat.

Kapaÿa silty clay, 40 to 100 percent slopes, occurs on broad ridges on the uplands. Permeability
is moderately rapid. Runoff is very rapid, and erosion hazard is severe to very severe. This soil is
generally used for water supply, wildlife habitat, and woodland.

Paumalü-Badland complex, occur on uplands with slopes that range from 3 to 70 percent.
Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is medium to rapid and the erosion hazard is moderate
to severe. This soil complex is generally used for pasture and military purposes.

Land Study Bureau Detailed Land Classification


The University of Hawaiÿi Land Study Bureau’s Detailed Land Classification – Island of Oÿahu
classifies non-urban land by a five-class productivity rating system, using the letters A, B, C, D
and E, where “A” represents the highest class of productivity and “E” the lowest.

The Detailed Land Classification – Island of Oÿahu classifies lands of Camp Püpükea as “C” and
“E” (Figure 11). The soils covering Camp Püpükea generally have little or no potential for soil-
based agricultural production.

Agricultural Lands of Importance to the State of Hawai‘i

The Agricultural Lands of Importance to the State of Hawaiÿi (ALISH) classification system is
based primarily, but not exclusively, on soil characteristics and criteria of or similar to that of the
national NRCS classification system. The ALISH system identifies and maps three broad classes
of agricultural land – Prime, Unique, and Other Important Agricultural Land, as well as
Unclassified Land.

Under the ALISH land system classification, the Camp Püpükea lands are designated as Prime
Agricultural Land and Unclassified Land (Figure 11). Approximately 54 percent of Camp
Püpükea is classified as Prime Agricultural Land although the entire property is within the
Conservation District.

According to the ALISH system, when treated and managed according to modern farming
methods, including water management, Prime Agricultural Land has the soil quality, growing
season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields of crops economically.
Prime Agricultural Land is land best suited for the production of food, feed, forage, and fiber
crops.

Potential Impacts and Mitigative Measures

The Camp Püpükea improvements will not reduce the inventory of agriculturally significant
land. The site is comprised of silty clay soils where permeability and runoff is rapid and erosion
can be severe. Soils at the site are classified as “C” and “E” on the LSB classification, indicating
that the site is not agriculturally significant. Although the lands are designated as Prime under the
ALISH system, the entire property is located within the State Land Use Conservation District.

Impacts to the soils include potential for soil erosion and the generation of dust during grading
and construction. All construction activities will comply with all applicable Federal, State, and
County regulations and rules for erosion control. Although not expected, if soil disturbance

exceeds one acre in area, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
for Storm Water Associated with Construction Activity will be necessary.

During construction and landscaping at the site, top soil and vegetation will be disturbed on a
localized basis. Contractors will use best management practices (BMPs) to minimize erosion
during construction and planting. Long term, the landscaping will mitigate the potential of soil
erosion from wind and water runoff.

3.4    HYDROLOGY

Camp Püpükea is located within the Kälunawaika‘ala and Päkülena watersheds, which taken
together measure approximately two square miles. Kälunawaika‘ala watershed reaches a
maximum elevation of 974 feet along the Ko‘olau mountain range and Päkülena reaches just
below that at 938 feet. A watershed area captures rainfall and atmospheric moisture from the air
and allows the water to drip slowly into underground aquifers or enter stream channels and
eventually the ocean. A description of these resources are provided below.

3.4.1 Groundwater

There are two aquifer coding systems in Hawaiÿi used to characterize groundwater resources: 1)
the State Commission on Water Resource Management’s (CWRM’s) coding system and 2) the
State DOH coding system. Both coding systems are resource-based, CWRM’s system estimates
the quantity of sustainable yield in the area while DOH’s system is more for quality/
contamination risk considerations.

Based on CWRM’s coding system, the Camp Püpükea site overlies the Kawailoa Aquifer
System of the North Aquifer Sector. The Kawailoa Aquifer has a sustainable yield of 29 million
gallons per day (mgd) and belongs to a designated ground water management area. Aquifers in
the North Shore region of O‘ahu were historically developed for agricultural uses. According to
the U.S. Geological Survey, principal aquifers serving the North Sector include the Ko‘olau
Basalt in the east and the Wai‘anae Volcanics in the west. Groundwater in the region occurs as a
freshwater lens and recharge occurs naturally through direct rainfall infiltration and groundwater
inflow from adjacent areas. Discharge is by outflow to springs and the ocean and withdrawals
from wells and shafts.

The DOH coding system also classifies the underlying aquifer as the Kawailoa Aquifer System
of the North Aquifer Sector. DOH characterizes the Kawailoa Aquifer System as a basal
unconfined aquifer within horizontally extensive lavas. The aquifer is currently used for potable
uses, has chloride concentrations of less than 250 milligrams per liter, is irreplaceable, and has a
high vulnerability to contamination. Contaminants identified by DOH refer to any large-scale use
of the land where improper disposal of organic and inorganic chemicals into the ground occur.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Phase I improvements to Camp Püpükea will include new shower and bathroom facilities
connected to individual wastewater systems in compliance with EPA regulations. Previously, the
camp had latrines with wastewater disposal handled by 12 large capacity cesspools. However
since 2005, EPA regulations have required large capacity cesspools to be closed and replaced
with an alternative wastewater system. As a result of this requirement, in 2012, the latrines were
boarded to make them inaccessible and portable toilets are now used. As part of the upgrade to
individual wastewater systems, the existing cesspools will also be formally closed and a
Cesspool Closure and Backfilling Report will be submitted to both EPA and the State
Department of Health. These measures will provide long-term protection against cesspool-
related groundwater contamination. In acknowledgement of the State CWRM, the Boy Scouts
will use best management practices (BMP) to minimize the impact of any facility upgrades to the
existing area’s hydrology.

Further, upgrades to the camp are not expected to involve fertilizers, pesticides. or similar
materials that have the potential to contaminate groundwater. Therefore future use of the camp
for Boy Scouts activities are not expected to cause contamination or impact groundwater
resources.

3.4.2 Surface Water

Surface water sources include Päkülena Stream and Kälunawaikaÿala Stream, which both
originate within the boundaries of the Camp site. Both streams are perennial. Intermittent surface
water runoff associated with heavy rainfall drains through these stream beds.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) designates these two streams as freshwater
forested/shrub wetlands. According to the National Wetlands Inventory, the streams belong to a
palustrine system and are forested by woody vegetation at least six meters tall (Figure 12).
Woody plants include broad-leaved evergreen. The wetland is seasonally flooded, with surface
water present for an extended period of time at the start of the growing season and absent by the
season end.

The State DOH Water Quality Standards Map classifies Päkūlena Stream and Kälunawaikaÿala
Stream as Class 2 Inland Waters. Water Quality Standards outlined in HAR, 11-54-3 state that
protection of Class 2 Inland Waters is necessary to support the propagation of fish, shellfish, and
wildlife, and allow recreational uses in and on these waters. Discharges into Class 2 waters must
receive the best degree of treatment or control compatible with the criteria established for this
class.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Hawai‘i’s watersheds are characterized by steep terrain, flash flood-prone streams, and small
drainage basins. Watershed health has a direct impact on the health of coastal and marine
resources. For instance, according to the Hawai‘i Ocean Resources Management Plan, sediment
and pollutants from upland ecosystems and water sources can directly impact coastal waters and
marine life. To address these concerns, the Hawai‘i Watershed Guidance Report (in reference to
the Hawai‘i Ocean Resources Management Plan) outlines three strategic actions relevant to the
Camp Püpükea site to improve coastal water quality:

      Reduce soil erosion from upland forest ecosystems and conservation lands.
      Reduce pollutant loads from residential, agricultural, and commercial land uses in
       priority watersheds.
      Restore and protect wetlands, streams, and estuaries.

In accordance with the Hawai‘i Ocean Resources Management Plan, the Boy Scouts plan to
follow these proposed actions where feasible. This type of holistic, land-to-sea approach to
watershed management fulfills both the Hawai‘i Watershed Guidance Report’s guiding
principles for watershed management and the Hawai‘i Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control
Program (managed jointly by NOAA and the EPA).

The United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has the sole authority to determine if an
aquatic feature is or is not a water of the United States subject to regulation under Section 10
and/or Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. If any waterbodies within the camp are determined to
be waters of the United States, authorization from the Corps will be required prior to discharging
dredge or fill material into the waterbodies. In this scenario, the Boy Scouts would need to
demonstrate that the proposed facility upgrades do not increase sediment erosion or pollutant
discharge.

3.4.3 Marine Waters

The Site is approximately two miles inland from the nearest coastline on the North Shore. Near
shore marine waters off the coast of Sunset Beach are classified as class “A” waters by the State
Department of Health (DOH) (Water Quality Standards Map of the Island of Oahu, 1987).
According to DOH Water Quality Standards, “it is the objective of class A waters that their use
for recreational purposes and aesthetic enjoyment be permitted as long as it is compatible with
the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife, and with recreation in and on these
waters” (HAR §11-54-03).

Downstream of the site is the Pupukea Marine Life Conservation District.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Although Camp Püpükea is located approximately two miles inland, Päkulena Stream and
Kälunawaikaÿala Stream originate within the boundaries of the Camp site and eventually empty
into the Pacific Ocean. To reduce storm water quality/quantity impacts, improvements to Camp
Püpükea will maintain existing on-site drainage conditions as much as possible. Depending on
the severity of a storm, discharge of storm water runoff from the Camp site into marine waters
could occur. If required prior to construction, an NPDES permit will be obtained specifying
measures to prevent stormwater discharges from affecting coastal water quality. Even if an
NPDES permit is not required, best management practices shall be incorporated during
construction to prevent storm water discharges from affecting coastal water quality. Facility
improvements to Camp Püpükea will not significantly increase the amount of impervious surface
area and permanent best management practices like erosion controlling vegetation shall be
incorporated into the design to limit post construction levels of erosion. Also, facility upgrades
are not expected to increase pesticide or fertilizer use on the property.

3.5    NATURAL HAZARDS

Hawai‘i is susceptible to potential natural hazards, such as flooding, hurricanes, volcanic
hazards, earthquakes, and wildfires. This section provides an analysis of site vulnerability to such
hazards.

Flood

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) publishes flood information in the form
of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) used by government and insurance agencies to determine
the relative potential for damage during flood events. According to the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Flood
Insurance Program, the entire Camp site is located in Zone D or unstudied areas where flood
hazards are undetermined but possible (Figure 13).

Currently, surface runoff sheet flows from east to west, in a mauka to makai direction where it
may enter the two streams onsite or continue off site.

Tsunami

Since the early 1800’s, approximately 50 tsunami have inundated the State of Hawai‘i’s shores.
Seven historical events have caused major damage. According to the FEMA Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRM), Camp Püpükea is located well outside of areas which would be impacted by
coastal flooding (from a tsunami). The most recent tsunami to impact O‘ahu, occurred on March

11, 2011, causing damage at several locations around the island especially the north shore. There
are no records of inundation of lands within Camp Püpükea during any of the recorded tsunami.
The Site is located approximately two miles inland from the nearest coastline on the North
Shore, outside of the designated tsunami evacuation zone.

Hurricane

Records show that strong wind storms have struck all major islands in the Hawaiian Island chain
since the beginning of history. The first officially recognized hurricane in Hawaiian waters was
Hurricane Hiki in August of 1950. Since 1982 two devastating hurricanes have impacted
Hawaiÿi: Hurricane ÿIwa in 1982 and Hurricane ÿIniki in 1992. While it is difficult to predict
these natural occurrences, it is reasonable to assume that future events could be likely given the
recent record.

Earthquake

In Hawaiÿi, most earthquakes are linked to volcanic activity, unlike other areas where a shift in
tectonic plates is the cause of an earthquake. Each year, thousands of earthquakes occur in
Hawaiÿi, the vast majority of which are so small they are detectable only with highly sensitive
instruments. However, moderate and disastrous earthquakes have occurred in the islands.

Wildfires

According to Honolulu Fire Department data, 399 wildfire responses occurred in the 2011 fiscal
year although the data shows a decrease of 24 percent from 525 wildfire responses in 2010.
Human carelessness is the number one cause of fires in Hawai‘i. Human error combined with the
spread of non-native invasive grasses, shrubs, and trees, has led to an increased susceptibility to
wildfires.

Much of the vegetation found within Camp Püpükea is identified as non-native, invasive weedy
species. A study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Services reports non-native
grasses as potential threats to Hawaiian ecosystems due to their ability to readily catch fire and
rapidly spread in the event of a fire. Non-native grasses on site include Hilo grass (Paspalum
conjugatum), narrow-leaved carpetgrass (Axonopus fissifolius), and basket grass (Oplismenus
hirtellus). The study specifically notes that Hilo grass poses a high threat to plant communities
due to its rapid post-fire occupation.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The camp upgrades will not present or exacerbate any hazard condition relating to tsunamis,
hurricanes, and earthquakes, and no mitigation measures are planned or warranted at this time.

The camp is not in a designated flood hazard or tsunami evacuation area. The potential impacts
of hurricanes and earthquakes will be mitigated through designing all structures in compliance
with the City & County of Honolulu’s building code. Impacts from natural hazards can be further
mitigated by adherence to appropriate civil defense evacuation procedures.

The Boy Scouts of America recognizes the role humans play in preventing wildfires and has
implemented fire prevention and awareness programs as a result. Scout members are trained on
proper campsite etiquettes to limit their environmental impact during camping. The Leave No
Trace Achievement Award program recognizes scout members who display an exemplary level
of stewardship toward protecting the environment and its natural resources. One of the seven
principles of the Leave No Trace Achievement Award is to minimize campfire impacts. The
Leave No Trace principles practiced by all Boy Scouts (regardless of whether they receive the
award) also give the following recommendations about minimizing campfire impacts:

         Use lightweight camp stoves instead of building a campfire
         If building a fire, use an existing campfire ring in a well-placed campsite
         Avoid fires in areas where wood is scarce: higher elevations, deserts, etc.
         Keep fires small and use wood that can be broken easily by hand
         Burn all wood to ash and remove all unburned trash/food from the fire ring
         Be sure that all wood and campfire debris is dead out

In addition to the above campfire protection measures, at Camp Püpükea, campfires are only
allowed in the campfire bowl gathering area and are required to be kept off the ground. All
campfires in the campfire bowl gathering area are administered and supervised by adult scout
leaders.

3.6       FLORA & FAUNA

Robert Hobdy conducted flora and fauna surveys of Camp Püpükea. The objectives of the
surveys were to:

         Document plant and animal species that occur on the property or may likely occur in the
          existing habitat.
         Document the status and abundance of each species.
         Determine the presence or likely occurrence of any native flora and fauna, particularly
          any that are federally listed as Threatened or Endangered; if such occur, identify what
          features of the habitat may be essential for these species.
         Determine if the camp area contains any special habitats which if lost or altered might
          result in a significant negative impact on the native flora and fauna in this part of O‘ahu.

                              DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

The results of the surveys are summarized below, along with other relevant information.
Appendix B contains the complete survey report.

3.6.1 Flora

No Endangered or Threatened plant species were found during the survey, nor were any plant
species seen that are candidates for such status. A total of 15 native species (both endemic and
indigenous) were recorded during the survey. Most of these were found on the ridge top along
the east side of the camp that overlooks Paumalū Gulch. None of the native plants are considered
rare and all are known from more than one island. In addition, no special native plant habitats
were found. An additional seven plant species found were “canoe plants,” brought to Hawai‘i
during the Polynesian migrations.

The vegetation within Camp Püpükea is dominated by non-native species. The camp is densely
forested except for clearings around camp facilities. Two tree species are abundant throughout
the area. Swamp mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta) forms the upper canopy at 60 feet to 80 feet in
height. Beneath this canopy, the shade tolerant strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) forms
nearly impenetrable thickets. In Hawai‘i strawberry guava is considered a highly invasive
species.

Many of the non-native plants within the camp have been planted as timber trees, fruit trees and
ornamentals, or in demonstration gardens focusing on Hawaiian cultural plants and on poisonous
plants, but the majority of the non-native plants are invasive weedy species.

The USFWS has designated much of the area of neighboring Püpükea-Paumalü Forest Reserve
as critical habitat for Hähä (Cyanea longiflora) and Nïoi (Eugenia koolauensis). These critical
habitat areas are to the northeast and southeast of Camp Püpükea, and there are no critical habitat
areas within the camp site. Figure 14 shows that there are no critical habitat designations within
Camp Püpükea.

Camp Püpükea and the surrounding area was once a diverse native forest with a great variety of
trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, and ferns clothing the ridge tops and gulches. Early western
explorers introduced several species of herbivorous animals in the late 1700s that were initially
allowed to reproduce and spread. They soon began to denude Hawai‘i’s lowlands and mountain
slopes of their native cover. By the end of the 1800s there was great concern that critical
watersheds were being destroyed. In 1904 the Territorial Legislature created the Board of
Agriculture and Forestry to address this crisis. The Pūpūkea-Paumalū Forest Reserve (among
many others statewide) was set aside in 1910 and work began to eradicate goats, sheep, and
cattle from the area. Fast growing non-native trees were planted to reforest barren slopes. As
these trees grew, other species of introduced plants spread and began to take over the understory.
Today this forest is once again dense with vegetation but the species growing here have

completely changed. Only a handful of the hardiest native plants persist within an essentially
non-native forest (Hobdy 2012).

Potential Impacts and Mitigative Measures

The botanical survey concludes that upgrades to Camp Püpükea: 1) will have a minimal effect on
botanical resources; and 2) are not expected to have a significant negative impact on the
botanical resources in this part of O‘ahu. Because of the existing site conditions and the absence
of any Endangered or Threatened plant species, there is little concern regarding the botanical
resources within Camp Püpükea. No special recommendations with reference to plants are
deemed appropriate or necessary.

Limited tree and vegetation removal may be necessary for some of the proposed improvements
to Camp Püpükea, especially related to the leach field creation necessary for the upgrades to the
wastewater system. All trees will be removed in accordance with the Conservation District Rules
(Title 13, Chapter 5, HAR), including obtaining a site plan approval from DLNR, if required.
Areas where tree removal is necessary will be quickly re-vegetated to prevent erosion.

Swamp mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta) is the most commonly planted tree species and most
common eucalypt in Hawai‘i. Most likely they were planted in the area of Camp Püpükea by the
State of Hawai‘i Forestry Division in the 1930s or 1940s as part of their reforestation plan. These
trees are not considered to have any special conservation status.

Strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) is classified as an invasive species in Hawai‘i and is
considered a very serious, habitat-altering pest in many parks and preserves where it poses a
major threat to Hawai‘i's rare endemic flora and fauna. Based on the conclusions of the of the
botanical survey that camp upgrades are not expected to have a significant negative impact on
the botanical resources, combined with the fact that the two most abundant tree species within
the camp are very common (swamp mahogany) or considered invasive (strawberry guava), any
tree removal within the camp will not result in significant impacts to plant species and may result
in beneficial impacts.

3.6.2 Fauna

The fauna within Camp Püpükea is sparse in diversity and mostly non-native. No native birds
were recorded during the faunal survey and only one native mammal, the ‘ōpe‘ape‘a or Hawaiian
bat was detected.

The USFWS has not designated any areas within Camp Püpükea or the Püpükea-Paumalü Forest
Reserve as critical habitat for any animal species.

                               DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Mammals

Three mammal species were detected during the course of the faunal survey. During the daytime
signs of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) were observed in the bottom of the gulches and dog (Canis
familiaris) tracks were found along the ridge top roads.

During the evening a special effort was made to look for the Endangered Hawaiian hoary bat or
‘ōpe‘ape‘a (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) using both visual and electronic techniques. When
present in an area these bats can sometimes be seen in the glow of twilight as they begin to
forage for flying insects that become active during the evening hours. In addition, a bat detecting
device (Batbox IIID) was used after dark, set to the frequency that these bats are known to use
for echolocation. No bat activity was seen at twilight, but later, after dark, at least three bats were
detected using the Batbox over a clearing near the top of the camp. Based on this information the
survey concludes that significant bat population is indicated in the area around Camp Püpükea.

Other mammals that would likely be found in the area, but which were not observed during the
survey, include rats (Rattus spp.), mice (Mus domesticus), mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus)
and domestic cats (Felis catus). Rats and mice feed on seeds, fruits, and herbaceous vegetation,
while the mongoose and cats prey on these rodents and birds.

Birds

Over the course of the survey, birdlife was moderate both in numbers of species present and in
the numbers of individuals seen. Eight non-native bird species were observed. Two bird species
were of common occurrence: the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) and wild chickens
(Gallus gallus). The six remaining species were uncommon or rare in occurrence however none
of these species are listed as Endangered or Threatened.

A few other non-native birds may also occasionally use the camp area. The habitat, however, is
not suitable for O‘ahu’s native forest birds which are presently restricted to good quality native
forests at higher elevations. The habitat is also not suitable for native seabirds such as the
Endangered ‘ua‘u (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and the Threatened ‘a‘o (Puffinus newelli) which
nest in dense, wet fern shrubland near the summits of mountains.

Insects

Insect life was rather sparse in the dense non-native forest that covers most of the camp. Only
eight insect species were observed during the course of the survey. Insects within the camp
include: spiders, mosquitos, wasps, moths, butterflies (three species), and grasshoppers.

                              DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Only one insect species was common throughout the area, the house mosquito (Culex
quinquefasciatus). Less common were the passion flower butterfly (Agraulis vanillae) and the
small rice grasshopper (Oxya japonica). No native insect species were seen and none of the
observed insect species is listed as Endangered or Threatened.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The fauna survey concludes that there may likely be a significant population of ‘ōpe‘ape‘a or
Hawaiian bats around Camp Püpükea, but no other concerns with regard to fauna species or
habitats are apparent.

The Endangered Species status of the ‘ōpe‘ape‘a’s brings it under the jurisdiction of the USFWS.
The Boy Scouts will consult with the USFWS to arrive at a plan that will ensure that no bats will
be injured or killed in the course of upgrades to the camp. In general, Hawaiian bats are known
to roost in native and non-native trees greater than 15 feet tall. During the peak pup rearing
season between June 1 and September 15 young Hawaiian hoary bat pups may be incapable of
flight and harmed or killed if their roost site is disturbed. To minimize the potential for harm to
juveniles, removal and trimming of trees greater than 15 feet tall will be avoided during the peak
pup rearing season between June 1 and September 15. Other measures to protect ‘ōpe‘ape‘a, as
may be recommended by the USFWS will also be implemented.

          POTENTIAL IMPACTS, AND MITIGATION MEASURES
4.1     ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES

Scientific Consultant Services, Inc. conducted an archaeological inventory survey of Camp
Püpükea. Fieldwork included a pedestrian survey and manual excavation of four shovel probes.
All excavated materials were visually inspected for the presence of cultural materials. The report
findings are summarized below. Appendix C contains the complete report.

Land Use History

In the second half of the 19th century, sugar cane planting became a lucrative endeavor. Its
cultivation quickly spread throughout the islands, as more and more large land sections became
available for lease and purchase. Plantations located on the more isolated North Shore benefited
from a railway system built by Benjamin Dillingham in 1889 (Dorrance and Morgan 2000:44).
The O.R. & L. Railroad eventually extended from Honolulu to Kahuku, stopping at the various
sugar plantations along the way. The Waimea Railroad Station, known as Maunawai Station,
was located at the junction of the government road and the Pūpūkea Road.

In the early 1900s, farming in upland Pūpūkea became profitable now that there was a train to
transport crops to the city. Large tracts of land were sold by the government and Frederick
Haley, Sr. planted 400 acres in avocado trees, eventually growing 11,000 tress of many different
varieties (Clark 1977: 123). Three Tables Cove, previously known for the Kalua o Maua stone,
was called Avocado Beach, as mule-powered wagons full of ripe avocados, slowly descended
the steep, dirt road along the cliffs to the Maunawai train stop at the bottom (ibid:124). After
Haley sold most of his farm to Libby, McNeil, and Libby, pineapple was cultivated in the
Pūpūkea highlands. These were also taken by mule-wagons down the cliffs, known by then as
“Jackass Hill,” to the Maunawai train station (ibid.).

As the United States (U.S.) sought to expand its land holdings and become a global power, it saw
Hawai‘i as a key strategic military location. On June 29, 1927, President Coolidge signed
Executive Order 4697, which set aside lands in the Republic of Hawai‘i—including lands in
Püpükea—for U.S. Military Reservations. However, initial land surveys proved to be erroneous.
Thus, on August 21, 1929, President Hoover signed Executive Order 5175, which corrected the
incorrect land survey boundaries. Subsequently, the U.S. military established camps—such as
the Püpükea Military Reservation—and defense infrastructure around the island of O‘ahu. Many
of these military establishments remained active until the end of World War II. On October 14,
1953, Executive Order 10496, signed by President Eisenhower, restored possession, use, and
control of all public lands that had been transferred to the federal government by the Republic of

Hawai’i back to the Territory of Hawai‘i. The Püpükea Military Reservation—now the site of
Camp Püpükea —was included in this land transfer.

In summary, the Camp Püpükea site was occupied by the U.S. military from approximately
1927-1953. Prior to and during World War II, the Püpükea Military Reservation was used as the
site for Püpükea Battery Emplacements 1 and 2, which were parts of the U.S. Army Fleet
Defense System. After World War II, the site was mainly used for housing soldiers.

Prior Archaeological Studies

No past archaeological studies have been conducted specifically on the Camp Püpükea site.
Nevertheless, other archaeological studies have been conducted for areas in the vicinity of Camp
Püpükea.

In 1933, J. Gilbert McAllister described, mapped, and photographed Pu‘u o Mahuka Heiau
(located three miles west of the Camp). Smith and Yent (1991) conducted additional mapping
and subsurface testing of the Heiau, which revealed intact cultural deposits. An Archaeological
Reconnaissance of the property conducted by Dennison (1979) identified a historic stone-walled
enclosure below the Püpükea cliffs. During the Kamehameha Highway/Waimea Bay Emergency
Rockfall Mitigation Project, rock shelters below the Heiau were found to contain human skeletal
remains (McIntosh and Cleghorn 2000). In 2011, no new archaeological sites were discovered
during an Archaeological Monitoring program conducted by Scientific Consultant Services, Inc.

Identified Sites

The archaeological inventory survey of Camp Püpükea did not reveal any Hawaiian cultural
artifacts or human remains. During the survey 15 new archaeological sites, comprised of a total
of thirty surface features, were identified. All fifteen archaeological sites were interpreted as
associated with the United States Army, based on feature type, construction methods, and
construction materials. One site was also interpreted as a historic road associated with the
development of Pupukea-Paumalu Homesteads.

Twenty-four artifacts were discovered from the ground surface survey. A complete list of
artifacts can be found in Appendix C. A subsequent laboratory study evaluated each artifact
based on type, materials, and historical context. All 24 artifacts were determined to be historic
materials related to the U.S. Army. Twenty-two of the 24 artifacts were manufactured between
1929 and1954. This time period is consistent with the U.S. Army’s occupation of the Camp
Püpükea site from 1927to 1953. Moreover, the other two recovered artifacts—a .30-caliber rifle
and a porcelain electrical insulator—were commonly used by the U.S. Military at that time.
These findings suggest that the U.S. Army has been the primary occupant of the Camp Püpükea
site.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The archaeological inventory survey recommends that no further archaeological work is
necessary for the Camp Püpükea property. To be considered “significant,” under Hawai‘i
Administrative Rules §13-275-6, an archaeological site must be characterized by one or more of
five criteria. Upon evaluation of the study area, it was determined that several sites within the
Camp Püpükea property were significant under Criterion D for information purposes only. In
other words, further evaluation of the site is unlikely to yield any archaeological information that
is considered historically significant. Therefore, based on the archaeological inventory survey,
preservation of the existing artifacts is not necessary and future archaeological studies are not
warranted.

While the archaeological inventory survey did not reveal any Hawaiian cultural artifacts or
human remains within the Camp Püpükea site, the Boy Scouts and its contractors will comply
with all State and County laws and rules regarding the preservation of archaeological and historic
sites. The construction documents will include a provision that if undocumented historic sites
such as walls, platforms, pavements and mounds, or remains such as artifacts, burials,
concentrations of shell or charcoal or artifacts are inadvertently encountered during construction
activities, work will cease immediately in the vicinity of the find and the find will be protected.
The contractor will immediately contact the State Historic Preservation Division, which will
assess the significance of the find and recommend appropriate mitigation measures, if necessary.

4.2     CULTURAL RESOURCES

Scientific Consultant Services, Inc. prepared a Cultural Impact Assessment (CIA) for the Camp
Püpükea property. The CIA was conducted in accordance with the Hawai‘i State Office of
Environmental Quality Control’s (QEQC) guidelines for assessing cultural impacts. Thus, it
includes archival research of published/unpublished sources and interviews of
individuals/organizations with knowledge relevant to the Camp Püpükea property. The report
findings are summarized below. Appendix D contains the complete report.

Wahi Pana (Storied Places)

Archival research revealed a mo‘olelo—an ancient Hawaiian story or legend—published in a
19th century Hawaiian newspaper discussing the beauty of Püpükea. According to the mo‘olelo,
as Hi‘iaka (Pele’s sister) traveled with her companion Wahineoma‘o, around the north side of
O‘ahu, she chanted the delights and special qualities of Püpükea. They continued to the plain of
Kuilima and watched the sea of Püpükea throwing its sprays upward. It swept over the leaves of
the ‘ilima, yellowing them, then Hi‘iaka chanted:

Pu‘u o Mahuka, a luakini (human sacrifice) heiau (place of worship), overlooks Waimea Valley.
This heiau is located approximately three miles west of Camp Püpükea and is situated on
Püpükea Hill. Considered the largest heiau on the island of O‘ahu (Handy and Handy 1972:
464), the construction and consecration of a structure of such prominence could only have
occurred at the behest of a paramount chief (Valeri 1985: 179, 234-235). Pu‘u o Mahuka Heiau
was first recorded by Thrum, but little was known of its actual origins. It was said to have been
built by menehune and, “…the fierceness of its dedicatory fires warmed the hills of Kaua‘i. This
gives a clue to its type as of the severe po‘o kanaka or human sacrifice class” (Thrum 1923:30).

Land Commission Awards

In the 1840s, traditional land tenure shifted drastically with the introduction of private land
ownership based on western law. While it is a complex issue, many scholars believe that in
order to protect Hawaiian sovereignty from foreign powers, Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) was
forced to establish laws changing the traditional Hawaiian economy to that of a market economy.
The mahele of 1848 divided Hawaiian lands between the king, the chiefs, the government, and
began the process of private ownership of lands. The subsequently awarded parcels were called
Land Commission Awards (LCAs).

Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) was awarded Pūpūkea Ahupua`a. However, his listed awards on
O`ahu include only Kona, Ko`olau Poko, and `Ewa, suggesting he gave up Pūpūkea to the
government (Waihona `Aina database 2013, Chinen 1961: 26). This is substantiated by the
Boundary Commission Documents, specifically Boundary Commission Document (BCId):
14985, which indicated that Pūpūkea Ahupua`a was Crown Lands. Thirty-one kuleana claims
were recorded for the ahupua`a, nine of which were un-awarded. Eighteen of the awarded LCAs
were located between Ka Awa ika ala and Waihuena Gulches and extended from the mauka
cliffs to the shore. This area received water from the mountains through the two gulches, creating
excellent conditions for agriculture. This section of the coast is now residential/agriculture and
the home of Sunset Elementary School. Land Court Award 08165, awarded to Hiipei, was
located below Pu`u o Mahuka Heiau and the Pūpūkea cliffs, and was claimed as a house site. No

LCAs could be identified in or near the project area. However, archival research indicated that
Land Grant 5172, comprised of 109.7 acres immediately adjacent and west of the project area,
was purchased by H.M. Stalnaker for $1,371, on May 2, 1909.

Consultation and Interviews

None of the individuals consulted indicated that the proposed improvements to Camp Püpükea
would impact traditional cultural practices. Interviews were conducted via telephone, email, and
the U.S. Postal Service. Consultation was sought from the Waialua Civic Club; Phyllis
"Coochie" Cayan, State Historic Preservation Division; Dr. Kamana‘opono M. Crabbe, Chief
Executive Officer, Office of Hawaiian Affairs; William Ho‘ohuli, community member; Kawika
Farm, State Historic Preservation Division, Burial Sites Program; Martha Yent, Department of
Land and Natural Resources, Division of State Parks, community member; Alan Carpenter, of
Land and Natural Resources, Division of State Parks; Dawn Wasson, community member; and
Tony Yardley, Cultural Monitor and Cultural Practitioner. Additionally, a Cultural Impact
Assessment Notice was published on March 17, 20, and 21, 2013, in The Honolulu Star-
Advertiser and in the May 2013 issue of the OHA newspaper, Ka Wai Ola. No public response
has since been received.

With its scouting program at Camp Püpükea, the Boys Scouts are proud to contribute to the
larger cultural context of Oÿahu. The Boy Scouts have not received requests from Native
Hawaiians to access the Camp Püpükea site for cultural purposes; however, access to the site is
permitted with permission from the Boy Scouts.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

According to the CIA report, it appears that the Camp Püpükea property has not been used for
traditional cultural purposes within recent times. Therefore, the CIA states that it is reasonable to
conclude that the proposed improvements to the existing Boy Scouts’ Camp Püpükea will not
affect the exercise of Native Hawaiian rights, or any ethnic group, related to gathering, access or
other customary activities.

                               DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

4.3     VISUAL RESOURCES

Camp Püpükea is located on O‘ahu’s North Shore atop the slopes of the Koÿolau Mountain
Range. Because of its location surrounded by the Püpükea-Paumalü Forest Reserve on three
sides, the camp site is surrounded by tall trees and thick vegetation—predominantly Swamp
Mahogany and Strawberry Guava. This forest setting prevents any views of the coast below,
including Waimea Bay. Likewise, Camp Püpükea is not visible from either Kamehameha
Highway or Waimea Bay. Looking toward the camp from sea level, the only visual image is the
face of the Koÿolau Mountains.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Because of Camp Püpükea’s visually remote location, the proposed facility upgrades will have
no effect on visual resources. Views from the camp site—both mauka and makai—will still be
severely restricted by forest trees, which prevent any coastal views. Similarly, the tall vegetation
will continue to block views of the camp site from lower elevations.

4.4     NOISE

Due to the remote and undeveloped nature of the area, there are no major sources of noise within
the vicinity of Camp Püpükea, with the possible exception of helicopters from sightseeing tours
or other aircraft. Natural sources of noise may include sounds from wind and rain. Noise from
within Camp Püpükea may be generated due to ongoing camp operations and would include the
sounds associated with human habitation and camp activities.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The upgrades to Camp Püpükea are not expected to exacerbate or otherwise affect ambient noise
levels in the area. The current capacity of the camp is 385 campers/staff. The proposed upgrades
to camp are projected to be the built out over the next 20 years and increase the number of
campers and staff by 100 to a total of 485. Relative to existing conditions, the additional number
of campers and staff is not expected to contribute to significant increases in noise levels.

Any increases in ambient noise levels due to the upgrades are primarily limited to short-term
construction activity. However because of the remote location of the camp, with relatively few
nearby neighbors, any noise from construction is likely not to cause any annoyances. In addition,
noise from construction activities will be short-term and will comply with DOH noise
regulations (HAR, Chapter 11-46, Community Noise Control). When construction noise exceeds,
or is expected to exceed the DOH’s allowable limits, a permit must be obtained from the DOH.
Specific permit restrictions for construction activities are:

                                 DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

          No permit shall allow any construction activities that emit noise in excess of the
           maximum permissible sound levels before 7:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m. of the same day,
           Monday through Friday.
          No permit shall allow any construction activities that emit noise in excess of the
           maximum permissible sound levels before 9:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m. on Saturday.
          No permit shall allow any construction activities that would emit noise in excess of the
           maximum permissible sound levels on Sundays and holidays.
          The use of pile drivers, hoe rams, jack hammers 25 lbs. or larger, high-pressure sprayers,
           and chain saws may be restricted to 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Following construction, noise from any additional vehicles traveling on Püpükea Road to the
camp is not expected to be significant.

4.5       AIR QUALITY

In general, air quality in Hawaiÿi is excellent due to the predominant northeast trade winds.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) there are no “non-attainment” sites in
the State of Hawaiÿi. A non-attainment area is defined as a locality where air pollution levels
persistently exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Because there are no “non-
attainment” sites in Hawaiÿi, the entire state is considered by the EPA to be in attainment for all
criteria pollutants. Thus, Camp Püpükea is located within an “attainment area.”

Regional and local climate together with the amount and type of human activity generally dictate
the air quality of a given location. The climate in the vicinity of Camp Püpükea is very much
affected by its elevation and the prevailing ocean-born trade winds. Temperatures range between
a high of 84 degrees to a low of 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Mean annual rainfall in the area amounts
to 62 inches with each month seeing at least three inches.

The present air quality in the vicinity of Camp Püpükea is believed to be relatively good and
there are no sources of potential air pollution.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The upgrades to Camp Püpükea will not exacerbate or otherwise affect air quality in the area. No
State or Federal air quality standards will be violated during or after the upgrades.

Limited, short-term impacts from emission of fugitive dust may occur during site preparation and
construction. As necessary, an effective dust control plan will be implemented. All construction
activities will comply with the provisions of Section 11-60.1-33, HAR related to Fugitive Dust.
Measures to control dust may include:

                                DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

      •   Providing an adequate water source at the site prior to start-up construction activities;
      •   Irrigating the construction site during periods of drought or high winds;
      •   Landscaping and rapid covering of bare areas, including slopes, starting from the
          initial grading phase;
      •   Disturbing only the areas of construction that are in the immediate zone of
          construction to limit the amount of time that the areas will be subject to erosion;
      •   Providing adequate dust control measures during weekends, after hours, and before
          daily start-up of construction activities; and
      •   Installing dust screening in the areas of disturbance.

Overall, air quality impacts will be temporary and limited to the duration of construction. Long-
term impacts are not expected.

4.6       ROADWAYS AND TRAFFIC

SSFM International prepared a Traffic Impact Analysis Report (TIAR) to evaluate the potential
traffic impacts resulting from upgrades to Camp Püpükea. The TIAR includes an analysis of
existing regional traffic conditions (including with current camp use) and projected future
conditions both without and with the upgrades to Camp Püpükea. The report findings are
summarized below. Appendix E contains the complete report.

Access to Camp Püpükea is from Püpükea Road. A description of existing roads and traffic
conditions is provided below.

Roadways

Püpükea Road: Püpükea Road is a 2.6-mile, two-lane, County collector that runs mauka-makai
(inland-oceanside) with a posted speed limit of 25 mph. The road intersects with residential
driveways and local roads providing access to homes. Also included along Püpükea Road is
access to Pu‘u o Mahuka Heiau, a historic site and Hawai’i State Park. Püpükea Road attracts a
variety of users as a result of the available access to these destinations. Parking is permitted
along the majority of Püpükea Road, including at the mauka end where the driveway to Camp
Püpükea exists.

Kamehameha Highway: Kamehameha Highway (State Highway Route 83) is a two-lane rural
primary arterial that runs north-south in the vicinity of Camp Püpükea with a posted speed limit
of 35 mph. The roadway cross-section includes ten-foot wide lane widths and five-foot shoulders
with parking prohibited along both sides of the road.

The makai end of Püpükea Road intersects with Kamehameha Highway at a signalized
intersection. The intersection operates as a four-way intersection with access to beach parking on


      CHAPTER 4 DESCRIPTION OF THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT, POTENTIAL IMPACTS, AND MITIGATION MEASURES
                                                   52

the makai leg approach. On the northwest corner of the intersection, the Sunset Beach Fire
Station exists. A designated left-turn lane exists for the southbound, northbound, and mauka-
bound approaches to the intersection. A couple hundred feet mauka of the signalized
intersection, on Püpükea Road, a dedicated left-turn lane provides access to the Foodland
supermarket driveway and parking lot.

Pa‘ala‘a Uka Püpükea Road (Drum Road): At the mauka end of Püpükea Road, a stretch goes
unpaved before transitioning to the paved Army owned and operated, Pa‘ala‘a Uka Püpükea
Road (also known as Drum Road). Pa‘ala‘a Uka Püpükea Road is a 23-mile road that provides
access to the Kahuku Military Reservation.

The roadways and parking area within Camp Püpükea are unimproved with surfaces composed
of a mixture of dirt and gravel. There are no concrete walkways or any asphalt pavement within
the camp.

Traffic Conditions

Since Camp Püpükea is currently in use, analysis of existing conditions included traffic related to
existing camp operations. Traffic volumes associated with Camp Püpükea include: 1) campers
and staff who are dropped off, participate in rideshare (i.e. arrive by bus, van, or carpool); and 2)
staff who drive themselves and leave their car at the camp overnight. Camp Püpükea directors
noted that nearly all camp users (i.e. campers and staff) arrive through rideshare.

Week-long camps during the summer (June-July) typically have the largest number of users. The
week-long camps generate trips: 1) at the start of camp on Sundays (between 10:00 AM and
noon) when people are arriving at the camp; and 2) and on the following Saturdays (between
10:00 AM and noon) when people are departing from the camp. The year-round weekend camps
are smaller and do not have set times of use. To assess a worst-case traffic scenario, the TIAR
analyzed weekend impacts as a result of vehicles generated from summer week-long programs.

With a current capacity of 385 campers/staff, it was assumed that the majority of campers (who
are under driving age) and staff come through rideshare with an equal distribution of vehicles
staying overnight and vehicles that drop-off/pick-up users at the beginning/end of the program.
Using an average of four campers/staff per vehicle, this equates to 96 vehicles, 48 staying
overnight and 48 traveling to/from the site for drop-off/pick-up. The existing parking lot has a
50-vehicle capacity and therefore is able to accommodate the 48 vehicles estimated to stay
overnight.

The TIAR studied traffic volumes and turning movements at the intersections of Püpükea Road
and Kamehameha Highway and at the Püpükea Road and Foodland driveway. Existing (2013)

                             DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

conditions at these intersections were analyzed for a peak Saturday/Sunday midday hour because
this is the time that the most camp users would be coming to and from the camp.

Based on analysis of existing conditions, the TIAR found that under current conditions level of
service was appropriate for all intersection movements. With all intersection movements
resulting in appropriate level of service, no mitigation is recommended for existing (2013)
conditions.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures

An existing unpaved road through Camp Püpükea will be upgraded to comply with HFD
requirements for fire access. The exiting road begins at Püpükea Road, runs through the parking
area, follows the slope down ridge to the lowest camp site, and then continues downslope to
provide access to the Püpükea-Paumalü State Park Reserve. Per HFD requirements, the road will
be widened within Camp Püpükea to provide for a continuous minimum width of 16 feet and a
fire truck turnaround area will be provided lowest camp site, before the road continues to the
Püpükea-Paumalü State Park Reserve (see Figure 9A). An additional unpaved roadway begins in
the vicinity between the health lodge and the trading post and follows the DLNR roadway lot
down the north side and around the campfire bowl area. Should other buildings be constructed
further along this roadway, the dirt road will also have to be widened to 16 feet wide and
improved to meet HFD fire code requirements.

Projected Traffic Conditions

Plans are for Phase 1 Camp Püpükea improvements to retain the existing maximum capacity of
campers and staff at 385. Phase 2 and Phase 3 improvements are expected to be built out over the
next 20 years and increase the number of campers and staff by 100 to a total of 485. With an
increase in 100 campers/staff for future conditions, averaging four people per vehicle, an
additional 25 vehicles would be attracted to the camp when all improvements are completed
compared to existing conditions. These additional vehicles would be using area roadways during
weekend camp start/end periods.

The TIAR projects that with the addition of Camp Püpükea-related traffic resulting from the
upgrades and the additional camp users, there will be minimal change in level of service at the
study intersections and the level of service will remain appropriate for all intersection
movements at the study intersections.

With all intersection movements resulting in appropriate LOS, no mitigation is recommended at
the study intersections for future conditions without or with upgrades to Camp Püpükea.
However the TIAR recommends that with the upgrades to the camp:

Draft Transportation Impact Analysis
Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery Park
December 2011



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the transportation impact analysis (TIA) results for the proposed operational
expansion of the Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery Park in Pittsburg, California.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Project site is located at 1300 Loveridge Road in Pittsburg, approximately 3/4 of a mile north of the
SR-4/Loveridge Road interchange, on the west side of Loveridge Road between the Burlington Northern
and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad and the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway. Vehicular access to the site is from two
unsignalized, full access driveways on Loveridge Road; the southerly driveway is the main public
driveway to the facility.

Current operations on the project site include receiving, sorting, processing, recycling, and transporting of
municipal solid waste and recyclables, green waste, and mixed construction and demolition materials.
The existing site is comprised of the following facilities:

       Mt. Diablo Recycling Facility (MDRF)

       Recycling Center and Transfer Station (RCTS)

       Green Material Processing Operations Area

       Mixed Construction and Demolition Processing Area

The Project consists of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for the operational expansion and reorganization
of the facility. The Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery Park (MDRRP) would house expanded operations of
the facilities listed above, as well as a new Biomass Gasification Unit. Based on the Project description,
the Project would increase the permitted capacity by 3,340 tons per day (TPD).

This study analyzes two Project scenarios: maximum permitted and typical operating conditions. The
maximum permitted scenario reflects maximum potential trip generation for the site, derived from the
difference between existing observed operating conditions and the proposed maximum permitted levels.
Because the facility does not typically operate at current maximum permitted levels, a second Project
scenario was evaluated based on the difference between existing observed operating conditions and the
projected operating levels of the expanded site under typical conditions.

This study addresses the Project’s impacts on the roadway system under both typical and maximum
operating conditions, and discusses the adjacent bicycle, pedestrian, and transit network.

STUDY INTERSECTIONS AND ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
Project impacts on the study area roadway facilities were determined by measuring the effect Project
traffic would have on operations during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM)
peak periods at the study intersections selected in consultation with City staff. Additionally, the driveways
that serve the site were evaluated.




                                                                                                           iv

For this study, the following scenarios were evaluated:

       Existing – Existing conditions based upon data collected in 2011.

       Existing Plus Project (Maximum Permitted Operating Conditions) – Existing conditions plus
        project-related traffic assuming ultimate site operates at maximum permitted levels.

       Existing Plus Project (Typical Operating Conditions) – Existing conditions plus project-related
        traffic assuming ultimate site operates at typical levels.

       Cumulative – Future (Year 2030) forecast conditions based on the Contra Costa Transportation
        Authority (CCTA) Travel Demand Model (TDM).

       Cumulative Plus Project (Maximum Permitted Operating Conditions) – Future (Year 2030)
        forecast conditions based on the CCTA TDM plus project-related traffic assuming ultimate site
        operates at maximum permitted levels.

       Cumulative Plus Project (Typical Operating Conditions) – Future (Year 2030) forecast
        conditions based on the CCTA TDM plus project-related traffic assuming ultimate site operates at
        typical levels.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Off-Site Findings

Results of the intersection operations analysis indicate that under Existing plus Project conditions, with
the Project operating under typical operating conditions, the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road
intersection is projected to experience a significant Project impact. With operations under maximum
permitted levels, operations of the SR 4 Eastbound Ramps / Loveridge Road intersection is projected to
degrade to an unacceptable level, resulting in a significant impact. Improvements are planned at both of
these intersections that would result in acceptable service levels with the project under maximum
permitted operating conditions. The Project would contribute their fair share to these planned
improvements through the payment of local and regional traffic impact fees, reducing the Existing plus
Project impact to a less-than-significant level.

Under Cumulative plus Project conditions, all study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable
service levels with the addition of Project traffic under typical operating conditions. Operations under
maximum permitted levels would worsen the operation of the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge
Road intersection, resulting in a significant impact. To mitigate this impact, significant capacity
improvements above those already planned would have to be undertaken, including a second westbound
left-turn lane, conversion of the northbound left-through shared lane to an exclusive northbound left-turn
lane, conversion of the existing northbound shared left-turn/through lane to a through-only lane, signal
phasing modifications to allow protected left-turn operation, upgrades to the existing traffic signal
equipment, and potentially upgrades to the rail crossing on Loveridge Road just south of the intersection.
These improvements may be infeasible to construct due to various constraints including right-of-way
constraints and the need to relocate railroad crossing equipment adjacent to the intersection. Therefore,
the Project’s impact would be significant and unavoidable under maximum operating conditions.

Table ES-1 presents the intersection analysis results for the study intersections which experience
significant impacts due to the proposed Project under Existing and Cumulative conditions, as well as the
results under mitigated conditions.

It should be noted that the option to haul waste via the adjacent rail lines is being considered as a future
option, although it is not proposed for implementation at this time. Should rail haul operations be


                                                                                                          v

implemented, it is expected that the rail capacity could accommodate approximately 2,700 TPD, which
would reduce the net-increase in tonnage to be hauled via the vehicular transportation network to
approximately 640 TPD. Under rail haul operations, the significant and unavoidable impact identified
under maximum permitted conditions at the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road intersection
would be reduced to a less-than-significant level.

On-Site Findings

Site access and circulation were reviewed for the proposed Project. The following on-site improvements
are recommended, as depicted on Figure ES-1:

       Maintain the southern driveway as the main entrance to the Project site.

       Maintain access restrictions at driveway between north and south driveways.

       Restrict access at northern driveway to only allow employees and transfer vehicles.

       Maintain on-site pedestrian crossings along main drive aisle adjacent to parking lot.

       Create a more formal intersection connection from drive aisle and Mixed C&D Processing Area.

       Construct a 10-foot wide sidewalk along the Project’s frontage

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the analysis and findings of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) for the
proposed expansion of the Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery Park in Pittsburg, California (the “Project”). The
purpose of the TIA is to evaluate the impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding transportation
system and identify improvements to mitigate significant impacts. This chapter discusses the study
purpose, study area, analysis scenarios, analysis methods, significance criteria used to evaluate project
impacts, and report organization.

STUDY PURPOSE
The study purpose is to evaluate the transportation impacts of the Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery Park
proposed expansion. The site is located on the west side of Loveridge Road between the Burlington
Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad and the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway, approximately 3/4 of a mile
north of the SR-4/Loveridge Road interchange, as shown on Figure 1.

Current operations on the project site include receiving, sorting, processing, recycling, and transporting of
municipal solid waste and recyclables, green waste, and mixed construction and demolition materials,
comprised of the following facilities:

       Mt. Diablo Recycling Facility (MDRF)

       Recycling Center and Transfer Station (RCTS)

       Green Material Processing Operations Area

       Mixed Construction and Demolition Processing Area

The Project consists of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for the operational expansion and reorganization.
The Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery Park (MDRRP) would house expanded operations of the facilities
listed above, as well as a new Biomass Gasification Unit. Based on the Project description, the Project
would increase the permitted capacity by 3,340 tons per day (TPD). The conceptual Project site plan is
shown on Figure 2.

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
The operations of these intersections were evaluated during the weekday morning and evening peak
commute periods for the following scenarios:

       Existing – Existing conditions based upon data collected in 2011.

       Existing Plus Project (Maximum Permitted Operating Conditions) – Existing conditions plus
        project-related traffic assuming ultimate site operates at maximum permitted levels.

       Existing Plus Project (Typical Operating Conditions) – Existing conditions plus project-related
        traffic assuming ultimate site operates at typical levels.

       Cumulative – Future (Year 2030) forecast conditions based on the Contra Costa Transportation
        Authority (CCTA) Travel Demand Model (TDM).

       Cumulative Plus Project (Maximum Permitted Operating Conditions) – Future (Year 2030)
        forecast conditions plus Project-related traffic assuming ultimate site operates at maximum
        permitted levels.

       Cumulative Plus Project (Typical Operating Conditions) – Future (Year 2030) forecast
        conditions plus Project-related traffic assuming ultimate site operates at typical levels.

ANALYSIS METHODS
Transportation engineers and planners use the term level of service (LOS) to qualitatively describe the
operations of transportation facilities. Level of service ranges from LOS A, indicating free-flow conditions
with little or no delay) to LOS F (representing oversaturated conditions with excessive delays). LOS E
described conditions at capacity. The transportation facilities evaluated in this study include signalized
and unsignalized intersection. The analysis methods for each are described in the following sections.

Signalized Intersections

Operations of the signalized study intersections were evaluated using the LOS calculation method
developed by the CCTA and the calculation method described in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM). The CCTA method uses various intersection characteristics (such as traffic volumes, lane
geometry, and signal phasing) to estimate an intersection’s volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio. Table 1
summarizes the relationship between the V/C ratio and LOS for signalized intersections. The HCM
method incorporates additional signal timing information to estimate the average control delay per vehicle
(measured in seconds). Control delay is the portion of the delay attributed to traffic signal operations and
includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay.
Table 1 also summarizes the relationship between the average control delay and LOS for signalized
intersections.

Unsignalized Intersections

For unsignalized (all-way stop-controlled and side-street stop-controlled) intersections, the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) – Special Report 209, Chapter 17 (Transportation Research Board) method was
used. With this method, operations are also defined by the average control delay per vehicle, based on
the delay associated with the stop signs. For side-street stop-controlled intersections, the delay is
estimated for movements that must yield the right-of-way: those from the stopped approaches and left-
turns from the major street. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized
intersections. The delay ranges are different than the ranges for signalized intersections due to



                                                                                                          5

differences in driver’s expectations. Signalized intersections are expected to carry higher traffic volumes
and experience greater delays than unsignalized intersections.

            Progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive
            during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all.                                           < 10.0

            Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
            Progression is good, cycle lengths are short, or both. More

            Higher congestion may result from fair progression, longer

            the intersection without stopping.
            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable.
            Longer delays may result from some combination of
    D       unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, and/or high V/C              0.81 - 0.90            > 35.0 to 55.0
            ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not
            stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.
            This level is considered by many agencies to be the limit of
            acceptable delay. High delay values generally indicate poor
    E                                                                                 0.91 - 1.00            > 55.0 to 80.0
            progression, long cycle lengths, and high V/C ratios.
            Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
            This level is considered unacceptable with oversaturation,
            which is when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of the
            intersection. This level may also occur at high V/C ratios
    F                                                                                    > 1.00                 > 80.0
            below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures. Poor
            progression and long cycle lengths may also be contributing

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
Significance criteria are used to determine whether a project impact is considered significant and
therefore requires mitigation. City of Pittsburg and Contra Costa County (for Measure C compliance) level
of service standards were used to determine whether the project would result in a significant impact to the
study intersections. Multimodal criteria and site access, internal circulation, and parking impact criteria
developed by Fehr & Peers and based on accepted industry practice were also applied.

Roadway System

Based on the adopted policies of CCTA and the Cities of Pittsburg and Antioch, a significant traffic impact
would occur if the addition of project-generated traffic would result in any of the effects listed below:

         Operations of a study intersection to decline from LOS low-D (a volume-to-capacity ratio of 0.84
          for signalized intersections or an average delay of 45 seconds for unsignalized) or better to LOS
          high-D, E or F

         Deterioration in already unacceptable operations at a signalized intersection by a change in V/C
          ratio of more than 0.01 or a change in average delay of more than 5 seconds

         Operations of an unsignalized study intersection to decline from an acceptable level to an
          unacceptable level, and the need for installation of a traffic signal at an unsignalized intersection,
          based on the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Peak Hour Signal Warrant
          (Warrant 3)

Impacts to signalized intersections are identified based in the CCTA LOS method.

Transit System

Transit impacts would be considered significant if any of the following occur:

         The project or any project-related mitigation measure disrupts existing transit services or facilities.
          This includes disruptions caused by proposed project driveways on transit streets, impacts to


                                                                                                               7

        transit stops/shelters, and impacts to transit operations from traffic improvements proposed or
        resulting from the project.

       The project interferes with planned transit services or facilities.

       The project creates demand for public transit services above that which is provided or planned.

       The project conflicts or creates inconsistencies with adopted transit system plans, guidelines,
        policies or standards.

Bicycle System

Bicycle impacts would be considered significant if any of the following occur:

       The project disrupts existing bicycle facilities.

       The project interferes with planned bicycle facilities. This includes failure to dedicate right-of-way
        for planned on- and off-street bicycle facilities included in an adopted Bicycle Master Plan.

       The project conflicts or creates inconsistencies with adopted bicycle system plans, guidelines,
        policies or standards.

Pedestrian System

Pedestrian impacts would be considered significant if any of the following occur:

       The project disrupts existing pedestrian facilities. This includes adding new vehicular, pedestrian
        or bicycle traffic to a facility already experiencing pedestrian safety concerns such as an adjacent
        crosswalk or school.

       The project interferes with planned pedestrian facilities.

       The project conflicts or creates inconsistencies with adopted pedestrian system plans, guidelines,
        policies or standards.

Site Access, Internal Circulation, and Parking

A site access, internal circulation, or parking impact would be considered significant if the project would
result in any of the following:

       Designs for on-site circulation, access and parking areas that fail to meet industry standard
        design guidelines.

       An insufficient quantity of on-site parking for vehicles.

       Increases in off-site parking demand above that which is provided in the immediate project area.

       An insufficient quantity of on-site parking for bicycles.

       Lack of or inaccessible and/or unsafe pedestrian connections between buildings and adjacent
        streets and transit facilities.

       Inadequate accessibility and circulation for service and delivery trucks on site, including access to
        truck loading areas.



                                                                                                            8

       Lack of or an insufficient ingress left-turn lane length at a driveway, causing the ingress left-turn
        vehicle queue to spill out onto the street's through travel lane.

       Lack of or an insufficient ingress right-turn lane length at a driveway, causing the ingress vehicle
        queue to spill out onto the street's through travel lane.

CHAPTER 2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the transportation characteristics of the project study area, including the
surrounding roadway network and transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the project
site. Existing intersection operations are also presented in this chapter.

ROADWAY SYSTEM
The project site is located on Loveridge Road, primarily surrounded by industrial uses. The roadways in
the study area are described below and their locations in relation to the site are shown on Figure 1

SR 4 is an east-west divided highway that provides regional access to East Contra Costa County. SR 4
stretches from Interstate 80 (I-80) to the west to Alpine County to the east. In the vicinity of the Project
site, it is a limited access freeway which serves approximately 110,000 vehicles per day (vpd) and
provides 2 lanes in each direction. However, construction is currently underway to widen SR 4 to provide
four lanes in each direction between Railroad Avenue and Hillcrest Avenue.

Loveridge Road is a north-south arterial roadway that provides direct access to the Project site.
Loveridge Road stretches from the Pittsburg Waterfront to the north and Buchanan Road to the south.
North of the SR-4 Interchange, it is an undivided roadway with two lanes in each direction. South of the
SR-4 Interchange, it is a divided roadway with two lanes in each direction. The posted speed limit on
Loveridge Road is 40 miles per hour (mph) north of Pittsburg-Antioch Highway and 35 mph to the south.
There is an on-street bike lane on the east side of Loveridge Road north of the SR-4 Interchange, and
along both sides of the street to the south.

Pittsburg-Antioch Highway is an east-west arterial roadway located just south of the Project site.
Pittsburg-Antioch Highway stretches from Harbor Street to the west to Auto Center Drive in Antioch to the
                                th
east, where it becomes West 10 Street. In the vicinity of the Project site, it is an undivided roadway with
one lane in each direction and has a posted speed limit of 45 mph.

Auto Center Drive is a north-south arterial roadway located east of the Project site. Auto Center Drive
stretches from West 10th Street to the north, where it becomes West 4th Street. To the south, it becomes
Somersville Road at the SR-4 Interchange. In the vicinity of the Project site, it provides two lanes in each
direction with a center two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) and has a posted speed limit of 35 mph.

Buchanan Road is an east-west arterial roadway located south of the Project site. Buchanan Road
stretches from Railroad Avenue to the west to Contra Loma Boulevard in Antioch to the east. In the
vicinity of the Project site, it provides one lane in each direction with a painted median and has a posted
speed limit of 35 mph. There is an on-street bike lane on both sides of Buchanan Road.

California Avenue is an east-west collector roadway located south of the Project site. California Avenue
stretches from Railroad Avenue to the west to Markstein Drive to the east; it is offset at Loveridge Road,
with the western segment intersecting Loveridge Road approximately 700 feet to the south of the eastern
segment. In the vicinity of the Project site, it provides two lanes in each direction between Carion Court
and Loveridge Road along the western segment, and one lane in each direction between Loveridge Road
and Markstein Drive along the eastern segment.

Leland Road is an east-west arterial roadway located south of the Project site. Leland Road stretches
from San Marco Boulevard in Pittsburg to the west to Century Boulevard to the east, where it becomes
Delta Fair Boulevard. In the vicinity of the Project site, it provides two lanes in each direction with a
landscaped center median and has a posted speed limit of 35 mph. There is an on-street bike lane on
both sides of Leland Road.

BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
Caltrans standards provide for three distinct types of bikeway facilities, as generally described below:

       Class I Bikeway (Bike Path) provides a completely separate right-of-way for the exclusive use of
        bicycles and pedestrians. Vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow is minimized.
       Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane) provides a restricted right-of-way designated for the use of
        bicycles with a striped lane on a street or highway. Bike lanes are generally five feet wide.
        Vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow is permitted. In some cases, vehicle parking is permitted
        adjacent to bike lanes.
       Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) provides a right-of-way designated by signs or pavement
        markings for shared use between bicyclists and motor vehicles.

In the vicinity of the Project, there are Class II bike lanes along Loveridge Road, East Leland Road, and
Buchanan Road. Additionally, there is a Class I bike path along the Delta DeAnza Regional Trail, which is
located south of the Project site between East Leland Road and Buchanan Road. As part of the East
County Bikeway Plan, a bicycle facility is planned along Auto Center Drive and Somersville Road.

Sidewalks are not provided along Loveridge Road north of the SR-4 Interchange, including along the
project frontage. However, sidewalks are generally provided along the other roadways within the project
site.

TRANSIT ACCESS
Tri Delta Transit is the transit provider in the area serving East Contra Costa County, including
Brentwood, Oakley, Pittsburg, and Bay Point. In addition, Tri Delta Transit provides a connection to the
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station at Pittsburg/Bay Point. Figure 4 shows the existing transit
services provided within the Project area. The characteristics of the Tri Delta Transit routes operating in
the area are summarized in Table 3.

EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak period intersection turning
movement counts were collected at all study intersections in October 2011. The existing peak period
traffic counts are provided in Appendix A. For each intersection count period, the hour with the highest
traffic volume was identified as the peak hour. The peak hour turning movement volumes are
represented on Figure 5. These volumes are used in the intersection operations analysis. Figure 5 also
presents the intersection lane configurations and traffic control devices.

EXISTING INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Existing intersection operations were evaluated for the weekday AM and PM peak hours at all study
intersections. Table 4 summarizes the intersection analysis results.

As shown, all study intersections and project driveways operate at acceptable levels except for the
Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road intersection, which operates at LOS E during the PM peak
hour based on the CCTA methodology and LOS F during both peak hours based on the HCM method.
Poor operations are primarily experienced for the westbound left-turn and through movements in the AM
peak hour and the northbound right-turn and eastbound through-movements in the PM peak hour. These
movements accommodate heavy demand for traffic avoiding the congested SR 4 corridor. Improvements
under construction on SR 4 are expected to reduce cut-through traffic at this intersection as well as other
local intersections along parallel routes, resulting in improved operations when completed. Detailed
intersection LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix B.

CHAPTER 3. PROJECT TRAFFIC
This chapter provides an overview of the proposed Project components and describes the methods used
to estimate project traffic. The project traffic estimates are used to evaluate project impacts on the
surrounding roadway network.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Current operations on the project site include receiving, sorting, processing, recycling, and transporting of
municipal solid waste and recyclables, green waste, and mixed construction and demolition materials.
The existing site is currently comprised of the following facilities:

                  Mt. Diablo Recycling Facility (MDRF)

                  Recycling Center and Transfer Station (RCTS)

                  Green Material Processing Operations Area

                  Mixed Construction and Demolition Processing Area

The Project consists of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for the operational expansion and reorganization
of the existing facility. The Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery Park (MDRRP) would house expanded
operations of the facilities listed above, as well as a new Biomass Gasification Unit. Based on the Project
description, the Project would increase the permitted capacity by 3,340 tons per day (TPD). Details of the
existing and proposed operational characteristics are presented in Table 5. The conceptual Project site
plan is shown on Figure 2. Vehicular access to the site is from two unsignalized, full access driveways on
Loveridge Road; the southerly driveway is the main public driveway to the facility.

EXISTING SITE TRIPS
Fehr & Peers collected vehicle counts at the Loveridge Road driveways to estimate existing vehicle trips
generated by the site. Daily and peak hour car and truck counts were collected on Thursday, January 27,
2011 and Friday, January 28, 2011. For purposes of this analysis, trucks are classified as vehicles larger
than cars and compact pickup trucks as they are typically used to haul material (i.e. waste) to/from the
site. The existing site trips were averaged and are shown in Table 6.

As shown in Table 6, the existing site generates 1,870 total daily trips, with 105 trips occurring during the
AM peak hour and 84 trips occurring during the PM Peak hour.

PROJECT TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation rates were calculated based on the existing site trips and the actual tonnage processed at
the site. The actual tonnage processed on the days the driveway counts were collected is presented in
Table 7. As shown, the average tonnage processed at the existing site is 1,121 TPD.

In terms of the average tonnage processed, which is 1,121 TPD, the following trip rates (listed by vehicle
type) were derived:


        Daily:            308.77 car trips per 1,000 TPD
                          1,360.03 truck trips per 1,000 TPD


        AM Peak Hour: 12.49 car trips per 1,000 TPD (57% In / 43% Out)
                          81.21 truck trips per 1,000 TPD (53% In / 47 % Out)


        PM Peak Hour: 14.28 car trips per 1,000 TPD (50% In / 50% Out)
                          60.68 truck trips per 1,000 TPD (51% In / 49% Out)

The estimated trip generation for the Project was derived using the calculated trip rates for cars and
trucks, as well as the maximum permitted capacity information of the expanded facility as contained in the
Project description. Table 8 presents the site trip generation of the existing facility and expanded site
under maximum permitted operating conditions as well as the net new Project trips. Trip generation
estimates are provided for both cars and trucks under daily, AM peak hour, and PM peak hour conditions.

As shown in Table 8, under maximum permitted operating conditions, the Project could increase the total
number of vehicles on the roadway network by approximately 7,376 vehicles per day, including
approximately 413 vehicles during the AM peak hour and 332 vehicles during the PM peak hour.

The trip generation estimates presented in Table 8 conservatively assumes that the expanded facility
would operate at maximum permitted levels every day. Because the actual average tonnage processed
on the days the site driveway counts were collected was 1,121 TPD, which is approximately 50 percent of
the 2,200 TPD maximum permitted capacity, a supplemental evaluation was performed to estimate trip
generation during conditions which are more reflective of typical operations. This supplemental
evaluation assumed that the expanded site would operate at similar levels relative to the maximum
permitted capacity. Although 50 percent of the proposed maximum permitted capacity of the expanded
site is approximately 2,770 TPD, the evaluation assumed that it would operate at 55 percent (3,050 TPD)
of the maximum permitted level.

Table 9 presents the trip generation of the existing site as well as the proposed expansion of the site
under typical operating conditions, as well as the net new Project trips.

As shown in Table 9, under potential typical operating conditions, the Project is expected to increase the
total number of vehicles on the roadway network by approximately 3,220 vehicles per day, including
approximately 180 vehicles during the AM peak hour and 145 vehicles during the PM peak hour.

Large trucks, such as those that currently serve the site, operate differently on the roadway system than
passenger vehicles. They take longer to accelerate and decelerate, and physically consume a larger
space. Due to the large percentage of truck traffic generated by the site, truck-trips were converted into
passenger car equivalents (PCEs) to account for their impact on roadway operations. PCE rates are
based on the size and carrying capacity of the vehicle. According to the Transportation Research Board’s
Special Report 223, heavy vehicles range from 1.5 to 3.7 PCEs. An average PCE rate of 2.7 for trucks
was applied for trucks including garbage/recycling collection trucks, large self-haul vehicles, and transfer
trailer trucks. This rate has been used in previous studies prepared by Fehr & Peers for similar facilities.

The PCE rate was multiplied by the total number of anticipated net new truck trips as a result of the
Project, as summarized in Table 10, to determine the passenger-car-equivalent trip generation. The total
Project PCE trips are presented for both project scenarios.

As shown in Table 10, under maximum permitted operating conditions, the Project is estimated to
generate 17,590 new daily PCE trips, with approximately 1,022 trips occurring during the AM peak hour
and 788 trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Under typical operating conditions, the Project is
estimated to generate 7,680 new daily PCE trips, with approximately 445 trips occurring during the AM
peak hour and 344 trips occurring during the PM peak hour.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
Trip distribution is defined as the directions of approach and departure that vehicles would use to arrive at
and depart from the site. Fehr & Peers developed an estimated distribution of project trips based on
existing travel patterns, general service area of the facility, and relative locations of other similar uses in
the region. The resulting trip distribution is presented on Figure 6. New trips generated by the Project
were assigned to the roadway system based on these general directions of approach and departure.

The project trips generated under both maximum permitted and typical operating conditions, as shown in
Table 10, were assigned to the roadway network according to the trip distribution shown on Figure 6. The
resulting trip assignment by intersection is presented on Figure 7 and Figure 8 for maximum permitted
and typical operating conditions, respectively.

CHAPTER 4. EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
This chapter evaluates potential off-site traffic impacts under Existing Plus Project conditions.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES
The peak hour project volumes were added to the existing traffic volumes to determine Existing Plus
Project traffic volumes. The peak hour traffic volumes under Maximum and Typical operating conditions
are shown on Figure 9 and Figure 10, respectively.

EXISTING AND EXISTING PLUS PROJECT INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
The Existing and Existing Plus Project intersection analysis results are provided in Table 11.

As shown, under Existing Conditions, all study intersections and project driveways operate at acceptable
levels except for the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road intersection, which operates at LOS E
during the PM peak hour based on the CCTA methodology. Impacts for the signalized intersections are
identified based on the CCTA LOS method.

With the addition of project traffic under maximum permitted operating conditions, the SR 4 Eastbound
Ramps / Loveridge Road intersection would degrade to a LOS high-D (V/C of 0.85 to 0.90) during the PM
peak hour, thus resulting in a significant impact. Additionally, the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge
Road intersection would degrade from acceptable levels to LOS F during the AM peak hour, and will
experience an increase in V/C of more than 0.01 during the PM peak hour, thus resulting in a significant
impact.

Based on the HCM methodology, both the SR 4 Eastbound Ramps / Loveridge Road and Pittsburg-
Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road intersections would operate at LOS F during at least one of the peak
hours with the addition of project traffic under maximum permitted operating conditions. The driveways
would continue to operate at acceptable service levels.

With the addition of project traffic under typical operating conditions, the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway /
Loveridge Road intersection would degrade to a LOS high-D during the AM peak hour, and will
experience an increase in V/C of more than 0.01 during the PM peak hour, thus resulting in a significant
impact.

Based on the HCM methodology, both SR 4 Eastbound Ramps / Loveridge Road and Pittsburg-Antioch
Highway / Loveridge Road intersections would operate at LOS E or F during at least one of the peak
hours with the addition of project traffic under typical operating conditions. The driveways would continue
to operate at acceptable service levels.

Detailed intersection LOS calculation worksheets for both CCTA and HCM methodologies are provided in
Appendix B.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Impact 1 – SR 4 Eastbound Ramps / Loveridge Road – Operations at this intersection is projected
degrade from LOS C to LOS high-D with the addition of project traffic during the PM peak hour under
maximum permitted operating conditions. This results in a significant impact.

        Mitigation Measure 1 – The SR 4 widening project would result in improvements at the SR 4
        Eastbound Ramps / Loveridge Road intersection that would increase capacity. These
        improvements include:

                Convert the existing configuration from being a “T” intersection to a 4-leg intersection.

                Modify eastbound approach from its current configuration which provides one shared left-
                 turn/through lane and one right-turn lane to provide two left-turn lanes and one right-turn
                 lane.

                Modify southbound approach from its current configuration which provides one through
                 lane and one shared through/right-turn lane to provide two left-turn lanes and two through
                 lanes.

                Modify northbound approach from its current configuration which provides one through
                 lane and one shared through/right-turn lane to provide two through lanes and one right-
                 turn lane.

        The proposed Project shall contribute their fair share to implement these improvements through
        the payment of local and regional traffic impact fees. As shown on Table 12, after implementation
        of this measure, the intersection would improve to LOS B during the PM peak hour. Therefore,
        this mitigation measure reduces the impact to less than significant.

Impact 2 – Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road – Operations at this intersection is projected
degrade from LOS B to LOS F with the addition of project traffic during the AM peak hour under maximum
permitted operating conditions. Additionally, during the PM peak hour, it is projected to experience an
increase in V/C of more than 0.01 when already operating at unacceptable levels without the Project. This
results in a significant impact.

        Mitigation Measure 2 – Implement the following measures at the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway /
        Loveridge Road intersection:

                Install a dedicated eastbound right-turn lane on Pittsburg-Antioch Highway.

                Install a second westbound left-turn lane on Pittsburg-Antioch Highway.

                Upgrade existing traffic signal equipment to accommodate the changed intersection lane
                 configurations.

        The proposed Project shall contribute their fair share to implement these improvements through
        the payment of local and regional traffic impact fees. The widening of Pittsburg-Antioch Highway
        from a two-lane roadway to a four-lane roadway is identified in the City of Pittsburg’s Capital
        Improvement Program (CIP). Additionally, the reconfiguration of the eastbound approach as
        documented above is consistent with an improvement project included in the CIP. As shown on
        Table 12, after implementation of this measure, the intersection would improve to LOS C during




                                                                                                             30

        the AM peak hour, and result in a lower V/C than without project conditions during the PM peak
        hour. Therefore, this mitigation measure reduces the impact to less than significant.

        It is important to note that the widening of SR 4, upon completion, is expected to result in a
        reduction in cut-through traffic at this intersection as commuters will use the freeway, resulting in
        better operations than presented in Table 12.

Impact 3 – Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road – Operations at this intersection is projected
degrade from LOS B to LOS high-D with the addition of project traffic during the AM peak hour under
typical operating conditions. Additionally, during the PM peak hour, it is projected to experience an
increase in V/C of more than 0.01 when already operating at unacceptable levels without the Project. This
results in a significant impact.

        Mitigation Measure 3 – Implement Mitigation Measure 2.

        As shown on Table 12, after implementation of this measure, the intersection would improve to
        LOS A during the AM peak hour and LOS low-D (V/C less than 0.85) during the PM peak hour.
        Therefore, this mitigation measure reduces the impact to less than significant.

CHAPTER 5. CUMULATIVE (YEAR 2030) TRAFFIC
           CONDITIONS
This chapter discusses Cumulative (2030) traffic conditions both without and with the project. The future
traffic conditions analysis takes into consideration forecasted land use development within the area
surrounding the project site, regional growth from outside the study area, and regional roadway
improvements.

PLANNED ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
The SR-4 corridor widening project, which will widen the highway from four to eight lanes between the
Railroad Avenue and Hillcrest Road interchanges, is currently under construction. This project will affect
the study intersections as follows:

       SR 4 Eastbound Ramps / Loveridge Road (Intersection #2) – The intersection is modified
        from being a “T” intersection to a 4-leg intersection. The eastbound approach (SR 4 Eastbound
        Off-Ramp) is widened to accommodate an additional left-turn lane, providing two left-turn lanes
        and one right-turn lane. Previously, two SR 4 Eastbound On-Ramps provided access from
        northbound and southbound Loveridge Road. Those are now consolidated into one on-ramp,
        which is aligned with the off-ramp. Additionally, the new on-ramp is widened to three lanes, with
        two lanes for mixed flow traffic and one lane for high occupancy vehicle (HOV) traffic. The
        southbound approach is widened from two lanes to four lanes, providing two left-turn lanes and
        two through lanes. The northbound approach is widened to accommodate a new right-turn
        pocket, providing two through lanes and one right-turn lane.

       California Avenue / North Park Boulevard / Loveridge Road (Intersection #3) – The
        westbound approach is modified to convert the shared through/right-turn lane into a dedicated
        right-turn lane, providing two left-turn lanes, one through lane, and one right-turn lane. The
        northbound approach is modified from its current configuration which provides one left-turn lane,
        one shared left-turn/through lane, one through lane, and one right-turn lane to provide two left-
        turn lanes, one through lane, and one shared through/right-turn lane. Additionally, the pork-chop
        islands which currently allow free right-turns at the eastbound and southbound approaches are
        removed.

       SR4 Westbound Ramps / California Avenue (Intersection #4) – The westbound approach is
        widened to accommodate a new through lane, providing two left-turn lanes, two through lanes,
        and one right-turn lane. The eastbound approach is widened to accommodate a new through
        lane, providing one left-turn lane, one through lane, and one shared through/right-turn lane.

Additionally, per the City of Pittsburg’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) project list, Pittsburg-
Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road (Intersection #5) will be modified to accommodate a new
eastbound right-turn pocket, providing one left-turn lane, one through lane, and one right-turn lane.
Additionally, the westbound right-turn pocket will be converted into a trap lane. East of Loveridge Road,
Pittsburg-Antioch Highway will be widening from a two lane roadway to a four lane roadway.

Figure 11 illustrates the lane configurations and traffic controls under Cumulative conditions.

CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS
Cumulative (Year 2030) traffic volumes were derived from the Contra County Travel Demand Model
(TDM). The model volumes and existing turning movement count data were used to estimate future
intersection turn movements using the Furness method. The resulting traffic volumes are shown on
Figure 11.

CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS
The project volumes were added to the Cumulative traffic volumes to develop the Cumulative Plus Project
volumes. The resulting peak hour traffic volumes under Maximum and Typical operating conditions are
shown on Figure 12 and Figure 13, respectively.

CUMULATIVE INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
The Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project intersection analysis results are provided in Table 13.

As shown, under Cumulative Conditions, all study intersections and project driveways are projected to
operate at acceptable levels.

With the addition of project traffic under maximum permitted operating conditions, the Pittsburg-Antioch
Highway / Loveridge Road intersection would degrade to LOS high-D during the AM peak hour and LOS
E during the PM peak hour, thus resulting in a significant impact.

With the addition of project traffic under typical operating conditions, all study intersections and project
driveways are projected to operate at acceptable levels.

Based on the HCM methodology, the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road intersection would
operate at LOS F during both AM and PM peak hours with the addition of project traffic under maximum
permitted and typical operating conditions. The driveways would continue to operate at acceptable
service levels.

Detailed intersection LOS calculation worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
As previously mentioned, the Project will have the following significant impacts under Cumulative
Conditions.

Impact 4 – Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road – Operations at this intersection is projected
degrade from LOS B to LOS high-D with the addition of project traffic during the AM peak hour under
maximum permitted operating conditions. Additionally, during the PM peak hour, it is projected to degrade
from LOS C to LOS E. This results in a significant impact.

        Mitigation Measure 4 – Implement the following measures at the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway /
        Loveridge Road intersection

                Install an additional left-turn lane on the westbound Pittsburg-Antioch Highway approach.

                Install a dedicated left-turn lane on the northbound Loveridge approach.

                Convert the existing shared left-turn/through lane on the northbound Loveridge approach
                 to be a through-only lane.

                Modify signal phasing in the north/south direction from split phase to having protected
                 left-turns.

                Upgrade existing traffic signal equipment to accommodate the recommended intersection
                 lane configurations.

As shown on Table 14, after implementation of this measure, the intersection would improve to LOS B
and C during the AM and PM peak-hours, respectively. However, widening along Loveridge Road to
accommodate an additional northbound lane may be infeasible due to the railroad crossing and right-of-
way constraints. Therefore, the Project’s impact under maximum permitted operating conditions remains
significant and unavoidable. Under typical operating conditions, the Project would not have a significant
impact on the operations at this intersection.

It should also be noted that the option to haul waste via the adjacent rail lines is being considered as a
future option, although it is not proposed for implementation at this time. Should rail haul operations be
implemented, it is expected that the rail capacity could accommodate approximately 2,700 TPD, which
would reduce the net-increase in tonnage to be hauled via the vehicular transportation network to
approximately 640 TPD. Under rail haul operations, the significant and unavoidable impact identified
under maximum permitted conditions at the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway / Loveridge Road intersection
would be reduced to a less-than-significant level.

1.       Introduction
1.1      Introduction
On the western shore of the Potomac River lies the waterfront district of historic Old
Town Alexandria. The Alexandria waterfront is a vibrant mix of residential, retail and
office space along with visitor, historic and recreational destinations. Visitors and
residents alike use numerous modes of transportation, ranging from personal
automobile, bicycling and walking, as well as mass transit, bus and now trolley car, to
access the area’s many amenities.

To ensure the future vitality of the waterfront, the City is undertaking an extensive
master planning exercise. A central component of the master planning efforts is to
analyze the City’s transportation network to determine redevelopment impacts. By
examining existing and projected traffic scenarios, the City can better serve the
community by refining its waterfront framework.

This report presents existing transportation conditions, projected future service levels
with and without waterfront redevelopment, and recommendations to improve the flow
of traffic within the study area.

1.2      Purpose of Report and Study Objectives
AECOM Transportation, in collaboration with AECOM Design+Planning (formerly
EDAW), has prepared a traffic impact study as part of the Alexandria Waterfront Master
Planning project. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the traffic impacts of
the preferred waterfront development concept. To this effect, the report examines and
presents existing and proposed physical conditions, as well as future build and no-build
scenarios and their respective impact on local traffic. Recommendations are provided
to assist the City in advancing a planning framework.

This study examines traffic impacts on key streets and intersections pertinent to
accessing the Alexandria waterfront. To capture transportation movements and
concerns that affect the waterfront area, the traffic impact area is a much larger study
area than just the waterfront. The Traffic Impact Study Area encompasses a street grid of
Old Town Alexandria extending from the Potomac River to the east, Washington Street to
the west, First Street to the north and Franklin Street to the south. The Alexandria
Waterfront redevelopment area is adjacent to the Potomac River, and lies within the larger
traffic study area as shown in Figure 1.

1.3      Study Methodology and Assumptions
To maintain a focus on traffic impacts associated with the affected project area, AECOM
and the City’s Transportation & Environmental Services (T&ES) staff made several
assumptions, as described below.

1. Traffic counts were conducted during weekday 7:00-9:00AM and 4:00-6:00PM peak
   periods (Thursday November 19, 2009) and weekend 12:00-2:00PM peak period
   (Saturday November 21, 2009) at the following six intersections along Washington
   Street:
              •   First Street
              •   Cameron Street
              •   King Street
              •   Prince Street
              •   Duke Street
              •   Franklin Street
2. Horizon year for the Alexandria waterfront development is 2030.
3. Study consists of a level of service (LOS) analysis for the six intersections. LOS was
   evaluated for existing conditions (2009), future (2030) no-build conditions, and future
   build out conditions (2030). The future no-build condition serves as a base for
   comparison, which assumes the traffic patterns continue as they currently exist,
   increased by the expected annual growth rate.
4. Synchro modeling software used to determine LOS (Synchro methodology) for AM
   and PM, and Saturday peak periods.
5. Proposed land uses for the waterfront development build out include office, hotel,
   restaurant, retail, apartments, and townhouses.
6. Annual traffic growth rate of 0.5% compounded per year with a cap of 5% to the year
   2030. The 5% cap on background growth is utilized for an existing build out urban
   environment such as the City of Alexandria and it represents the current saturated
   condition. Any future development at saturated traffic condition will occur without
   traffic increasing significantly.
7. No allowance for internal trips.
8. Modal split is Transit 20%; Walk 9%; Bike 3%; Carpool 10%; and Single Occupancy
   Vehicle (SOV) 58%. Transit, Walk, and Bike were combined in the analysis to
   reflect alternate modes, and Carpool and SOV uses are combined to reflect
   automobile trips.

9. Trip assignment follows existing turning movements and ADT percentages
   considering factors such as logical routing, roadway classification, available
   capacities and projected travel times. The trip distribution used is as follows:
             To/From North GW Memorial Pkwy                        30%
             To/From South GW Memorial Pkwy                        20%
             To/From West Franklin/Gibbon                          12%
             To/From West Duke St                                  5%
             From West Prince St (one-way)                         (6%)
             To/From West King St                                  5%
             To West Cameron St (one-way)                          (6%)
             To/From West Pendleton St                             5%
             To/From West Wythe St                                 5%
             To/From West Madison St /Montgomery St                6%
             To/From West First St                                 6%
             Total                                                 100%
Prince Street and Cameron Street are one-way in and out respectively and 6% is added
only once to a total of 100%.
10. Pass-by trips for proposed restaurant and hotel development are 10% and 0%
    respectively.

1.4       Proposed Development
According to the City’s Planning and Zoning Development Division, there is one
approved un-built development project in the waterfront area at this time. This
development project is:

•   1125 N. Royal Street (Windows of Old Town Condominiums) - Active/Under
    Construction (DSP2005-00018):
      •   30,274 SF. site on Third Street between Royal and Fairfax.
      •   21 townhomes with a reduction of 8 of the 10 required retail parking spaces
      •   18 townhouse-style condominiums
      •   3 condominiums over 1,946 SF of ground level retail
      •   47 parking spaces (one level underground parking garage)
      •   6 parking spaces in above-grade garage integrated into retail building
      •   15% visitor parking spaces provided in below grade garage
      •   36 % ground-level open space and 13% open space in decks and roof-top patios
      •   Traffic/transit: DASH bus stops at 2nd and N. Fairfax and 2nd and Pitt Streets (AT2
          and AT4)




                                                                                                       4
                                                                Alexandria Waterfront Traffic Impact Study




2.        Existing Conditions
The Alexandria Waterfront traffic study area, served by a robust transportation network,
is defined by the Potomac River to the east, Washington Street to the west, First Street
to the north and Franklin Street to the south. Figure 1 shows the traffic study area within a
regional map as well as the proposed waterfront development area. Currently, residents,
commuters, and visitors take advantage of transportation options that include mass transit
(rail, subway, bus and trolley), personal vehicles, motorcoaches/tour buses, water taxi,
walking and bicycling.

2.1       Existing Traffic Network
Roadways are classified according to their urban or rural setting, and the type of service
they provide based on considerations such as connectivity, mobility, accessibility,
vehicle miles traveled, average annual daily traffic, and abutting land use. The purpose
of the roadway functional classification is to describe how traffic is channeled through
the roadway network and to determine project eligibility for inclusion in the Long Range
Plan and short-range Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

Figure 2 shows the functional classification of roadways along with the Average Daily
Traffic (ADT) in the study area. Roadway classification within the project is based on the
VDOT/FHWA Functional Classification. The City of Alexandria has adopted a
classification system that is slightly different, but its characteristics are generally the
same. Roadway classification is as follows, with City classification in parenthesis:

              •   I-95/Capital Beltway – Urban Interstate (Expressway)
              •   Washington Street – Arterial
              •   Duke Street – Arterial
              •   King Street – Primary Collector
              •   Franklin Street – Residential Collector
              •   Wythe Street – Primary Collector
              •   Montgomery Street – Primary Collector
              •   Prince Street – Residential Collector
              •   Cameron Street – Residential Collector
              •   Pendleton Street – Primary Collector
              •   First Street – Local
The functional classification of streets and roadways not specifically mentioned is Local.



                                                                                                         5

2.2        Existing Traffic Operations
To determine existing traffic operations in the study area, traffic turning movements and
pedestrian counts were collected for weekday AM/PM and weekend peak periods.
These counts occurred on Thursday November 19, 2009 and Saturday November 21,
2009. Appendix A contains printouts of the raw turning movement count data. Traffic
turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 3. Weekday AM/PM and weekend
peak hours were determined based on these peak-period counts. Analysis of the turning
movement counts determined the four highest consecutive 15-minute volumes (the
peak hour) during each peak period. The peak hours were determined to be:

                •   AM Peak Hour: 7:00-8:00 AM
                •   PM Peak Hour: 4:45-5:45 PM
                •   Saturday Peak Hour: 12:30-1:30 PM
Pedestrian Counts were conducted on the same dates during the AM (7:00-9:00), PM
(4:00-6:00) and weekend (12:00-2:00PM) periods at the six (6) study area intersections.
Table 1 lists the total number of pedestrians at each intersection for all four crosswalks
for the peak hour.

The City supplied current signal timing and modeling files with basic timings, cycle
lengths, offsets and splits for the intersections studied. Using Synchro software, a
macroscopic analysis and optimization software program for modeling, analyzing and
simulating traffic networks, AECOM analyzed existing traffic capacity for 2009
conditions. This analysis established a base condition to determine the existing traffic
performance in the study area; Appendix B shows the software output.




                                                                                                      7
                                                          Alexandria Waterfront Traffic Impact Study



2.3         Capacity and Level of Service
The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), published by the Transportation Research
Board, contains the standard methodology used to analyze the various elements of
existing and proposed roadways. The Synchro traffic analysis software, using the
Highway Capacity Software module, was used for the traffic analysis of this study.

Level of Service (LOS) is a quality measurement of traffic flow in terms of speed and
travel time, freedom to maneuver, comfort and convenience. There are six LOS
designations, represented by the letters A through F, with LOS A representing the best
operating conditions and LOS F the worst. Signalized intersection LOS is determined
by seconds delay per vehicle. A level of service D or better is considered acceptable in
major urban areas such as the Metropolitan Washington Area. However, it is
recognized that the Northern Virginia area typically experiences considerably lower LOS
at peak periods at many intersections, and residents of the area are accustomed to a
level of service below that considered acceptable by traffic engineers.

Table 2 displays the criteria used to determine LOS and the results of the capacity
analysis performed for Existing Conditions are presented in Table 3 below. The results
indicate that during the 2009 year AM peak hour, two signalized intersections operate at
overall LOS E. During the PM peak hour one intersection operates at LOS E and during
the Saturday peak hour one intersection has LOS F.

2.4      Bicycle Facilities
The Alexandria Waterfront has good bicycle access with on-road and off-road
designated bikeways, bicycle parking locations, and convenient bicycle service facilities;
Figure 4 illustrates bicycle access in the area. Key among the existing access facilities
is the Mt. Vernon Trail. This major regional trail provides scenic connection to the
waterfront for pedestrians and bicyclists coming from the north or south along the
Potomac River. This trail also links Alexandria to bicyclists using the W&OD and Custis
Trail, as well as Ronald Reagan National Airport, The National Mall, and recently
constructed National Harbor in Maryland. The Alexandria Waterfront Framework
discussed a priority bikeway along Union Street, which currently has a on-road shared
lane markings to link the north and south ends of Old Town to the Mt Vernon Trail.

The existing bicycle access network provides on-road shared-use connection to the two
local Metrorail Stations; King Street and Braddock Road. Both of these stations have
bicycle lockers and racks for convenient storage. In addition, Metro allows bikes on
trains with some restrictions, chief among them that no bikes are allowed during
weekday rush hours (7:00 – 10:00 AM and 4:00 – 7:00 PM).

A 24-hour bicycle count along the Mt Vernon Trail just, north of Pendleton Street, had a
weekday average of 535 bicycles and weekend daily average of 2205 bicycles. This
count occurred from Friday September 4 to Wednesday September 16, 2009 (see
Appendix C for bicycle traffic count worksheets). From visual observation, bicycle user
types range from experienced riders to those with basic operating skills including
children.

2.5      King Street Trolley
The King Street Trolley operates between the King Street Metrorail Station and the
Alexandria waterfront. This free service transports visitors and residents between the
hours of 11:30 AM – 10:00 PM seven days a week. The trolley has a headway of 20
minutes.

The City of Alexandria provided Trolley Stop usage data for the ten designated stops,
summarized in Table 4 below. Total ridership for the 12 months ending October 19,
2009 was 522,420 passengers. Appendix D shows the Total Ridership Data -Trolley

2.6      Motorcoaches
Old Town Alexandria is a popular tourist destination,        and many tourists arrive by
motorcoach. Figure 5 shows a motorcoach map for              the City of Alexandria with
designated loading and unloading areas, and assigned         parking locations. To assist
motorcoach and tour bus owners and operators, the City       provides resources and maps
for information on access, regulations, and activities.

To minimize adverse impacts to the environment, resident quality of life, and visitor
experience, while balancing the need for this transportation modality, the City is
undertaking motorcoach management actions. To enforce motorcoach management
efforts, the Alexandria Police Department works to reduce engine idling, double-parking
and unlawful loading/unloading practices throughout Alexandria.

2.7      Water Access
Convenient access to Alexandria’s waterfront is not limited to land based transportation
options; water taxi, sightseeing and marina service is available. Daily water taxi service
operates between Old Town Alexandria and National Harbor, Maryland from March 1 to
December 31. Hours of operation are approximately 10:45 AM until 11:15PM. Visitors
and residents can traverse the Potomac River to and from the Alexandria City Marina to
the National Harbor north dock and the Gaylord National south dock. This fee based
service costs $8 one-way and $16 round trip for adults; fare for children (ages 2-11) is
$5.00 one-way and $10.00 round trip.

Sightseeing cruises originate from the Alexandria waterfront and includes destinations
such as the Washington Monuments, Georgetown, and the Mount Vernon estate.
Marina services are also available for private boating at the City Marina, which is
located at the base of Cameron Street. The marina has overnight boat slips plus
additional short-term docking and offers docking for pleasure boats and commercial
vessels; fees vary.

2.8      Old Town Alexandria Parking Study
The City hired a consultant to evaluate the current parking conditions and operations.
The findings are assisting in creating management and implementation strategies to
address parking in Old Town. A final report was submitted in April 2010. The Waterfront
Master Plan and this traffic impact study incorporate results and recommendations from
the parking study.

The parking study focuses on publicly available on- and off-street parking and does not
include analysis of private parking facilities. Study considerations of public parking
spaces available on-street, in surface lots, and garages within the study area include
the number, occupancy, and utilization. Types of on-street parking included metered,
residential permit, unrestricted, handicap, tour bus, trolley, and special parking. The
parking study area is significantly larger than the traffic impact study area. The parking
study area is bounded by Princess Street to the north, the King Street Metrorail station
and railroad tracks to the west, Duke Street and Wolfe Street to the south, and the
Potomac River waterfront to the east; an area of approximately 85 blocks.

The report revealed that parking is available during all periods studied but that parking
demand increased in proximity to the river. Alfred Street appeared to be the east/west
dividing line for Old Town in terms of higher parking demand. During peak periods, on-
street parking and some publicly accessible off-street facilities were effectively full. In
relation to the waterfront area, parking utilization along Union Street and The Strand is


                                                                                                    15

typically greater than 90 percent; the lowest utilization period occurs weekday evenings;
Fridays evenings record utilization rates in excess of 100 percent.

Parking counts reveal that there are 4,399 on-street and 3,933 off-street publicly
accessible parking spaces in the study area. Of the 8,332 total available spaces, on-
street parking accounts for the majority of available parking and comprises 60 percent
of the system. Although private parking facilities were not included in this study,
information provided by the City of Alexandria indicates that there are approximately
2,600 private parking spaces within the study area. The combination of publicly
accessible parking and private parking totals nearly 10,000 spaces in Old Town.

As a result of utilization calculations, observed conditions and City provided information,
numerous parking issues were identified. The report classified issues as Primary or
Secondary, some of which follow:

       •   Limited on-street metered parking availability (Primary)
       •   Limited on-street parking availability east of Alfred Street in the neighborhood permit
           district (Primary)
       •   Garages and lots are underutilized (Primary)
       •   Parking supply proximity (Primary)
       •   Difficulty in locating off-street parking
       •   Fee collection method
       •   Insufficient tour bus parking
       •   High auto use



2.9        King St. at Washington St. Exclusive Pedestrian Phase
This intersection is heavily used by pedestrians at all four crosswalks especially on the
weekends as shown in Table 1. A traffic analysis was performed for an exclusive
pedestrian traffic signal phase, where all vehicular traffic stops at all four approaches
and allows pedestrians to cross the King Street/Washington Street intersection in every
direction, including diagonally. While an exclusive pedestrian traffic signal phase may
have benefit for a pedestrian friendly appeal with weekend use it cannot be safely
configured exclusively for that time because pedestrian will have expectations of using
this during weekdays too. Finding of the analysis is that an exclusive pedestrian traffic
signal phase would cause additional delay to all vehicles using Washington Street
especially in the AM peak hour. The analysis results are: during the existing AM peak
hour from LOS A and delay 9 sec to LOS F and delay 228 sec, PM peak hour from LOS
A and delay 7 sec to LOS C and delay 24 sec and weekend from LOS B and delay 14
sec to LOS D and delay 51 sec.

3.           Future No-Build Conditions
             (Year 2030)
3.1          Future No-Build Conditions (Year 2030)
To provide a Base Condition with which to compare the Alexandria Waterfront
development scenario, the study developed a future No-Build Condition for Year 2030.

The components of background traffic are through traffic, consisting of all movements in
the study area referred to as “background growth”, and traffic generated by
developments in the area referred to as “background development”. The City of
Alexandria confirmed the study assumption that appropriate traffic growth in the Old
Town area is 0.5% per year. The 5% cap on background growth was set to account for
an urban environment where future build out will operate at saturated traffic conditions
without traffic increasing any further. Using a +0.5% annual compound growth rate with
a 5% cap, existing year 2009 traffic data was projected to Year 2030 for AM, PM and
weekend peak hours.

Traffic from the 1125 N. Royal Street (Windows of Old Town Condominiums as
discussed in Section 2) development was then added to these volumes. Trip generation
data was derived using the Trip Generation Handbook (ITE). Table 5 summarizes the
1125 N. Royal Street (Windows of Old Town Condominiums) trip generation.

The vehicular trips generated by the Windows of Old Town Condominiums development
located at 1125 N. Royal Street were assigned to the study area network and added to
2030 background volumes. Figure 6 presents the 2030 No-Build traffic volumes.

Traffic analysis performed using the Synchro LOS methodology for AM, PM and
Saturday peak hours resulted in the LOS shown in Table 6. This analysis shows three
(3) intersections during the AM peak hour and one intersection during the PM and the
Saturday peak hour that would operate at an overall LOS F in 2030 without the
Alexandria Waterfront development.

4.        Future Build Conditions (Year 2030)
4.1       Trip Generation and Distribution
In order to forecast the traffic impacts of land development, proposed land uses (hotel,
restaurant, etc.) are converted into vehicular trips. For a multimodal study, land uses
are also translated in terms of walking, bicycle, and transit trips. The Institute of
Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition provides trip
generation rates, equations, and data plots based on data collected at close to 5,000
developments across the country.

The manual categorizes land uses by type and provides a means to calculate vehicular
trips entering and exiting sites, and is the industry standard for transportation
professionals analyzing the site impact of proposed new development or infill projects.
Study calculations were based on number of dwelling units, square footage, gross floor
area, and other variables. The study estimated future vehicular trips generated by the
proposed waterfront development, as well as nearby programmed projects, using the
Trip Generation Manual.

The City of Alexandria provided projected waterfront land uses. Tables 7 and 8 present
the results of the trip generation analysis and Figure 7 illustrates the distribution pattern
of vehicular trips through the study area intersections.

4.2      Traffic Analysis
A LOS analysis was performed with the traffic volumes shown on Figure 8. Cycle
lengths, offsets, pedestrian crossing times, and other timing inputs were not modified
from existing conditions. Under build conditions, the results show that three
intersections during the AM peak hour operate at an overall LOS F in 2030. One
intersection operates at an overall LOS F during the PM peak hour and Saturday peak
hour. Table 9 shows LOS results for this condition.

When a street network is laid out in a grid, such as the study area for this waterfront
development project, drivers often find alternate (usually parallel) routes to travel. In
other words, while overall traffic volumes increase with the introduction of new
development, many of the trips would pass through less congested intersections near
the Washington Street corridor. Section 6 of this report includes further discussion
regarding the expected changes in traffic operations from No-Build to Build conditions.

5.        Recommendations
The previous chapters examined in detail the current traffic conditions as well as the
future build and no-build traffic conditions. In this chapter, recommended corrective
actions are presented that would optimize traffic operations should the Waterfront
Framework be implemented.

The goal of the recommendations is to promote a safe and robust multimodal
transportation environment for Alexandria’s waterfront and better serve the community
at large. To this regard, recommendations are categorized based on modal function.
The recommendations are:

   Transit recommendations:

      •   Incorporate the waterfront terminus into the overall waterfront
          destination to create a multimodal hub.
      •   Expand King Street Trolley operating hours and decrease headway.


   Pedestrian recommendations:

      •   Provide pedestrian safety improvements/new crosswalk                      at
          Montgomery/Washington.
      •   Provide Pedestrian signals at Washington Street intersections.


   Bicycle recommendations:

      •   Improve bicycle facilities along Union Street to improve connectivity to
          the Mt. Vernon Trail; Consider vehicular traffic using this bicycle route
          as a direct route in the North-South direction.
      •   Improve signage and way-finding to encourage cyclists to access the
          waterfront and to improve safety.
      •   Provide safe and accessible bicycle parking facilities to encourage off-
          bike activities and multimodal activity.


   Motorcoach recommendations:

      •   Allow left turns from King Street to Washington Street for
          motorcoaches only to remove bus traffic from adjacent residential
          streets.


                                                                                                         27
                                                            Alexandria Waterfront Traffic Impact Study




   Parking recommendations:

      •   Implement the recommendations of the April 2010 Old Town
          Alexandria Parking study.

   Vehicle recommendations:

      •   Evaluate left-turn traffic signal phase for southbound movements at
          intersections of Madison St/Washington St and Wythe St/Washington
          St. as development increases at the Alexandria waterfront.
      •   Enhance current carpool and bus ridership campaign.
      •   Provide way-finding using Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)
          technology to direct traffic to existing public parking lots.


The Alexandria Waterfront Traffic Impact Study is part of a master planning process
with a 20-year horizon. As proposed development projects come on line, more detailed
transportation studies are recommended to assess impacts and offer mitigation
strategies that are consistent with the City’s vision for the waterfront area and adjacent
study areas. Over time, recommendations can be implemented as development (and
traffic volume) increases and/or in response to modal variations.

Institution of the proposed waterfront improvements will add traffic volume to the study
area roadways. However, actions can be taken to mitigate the increases in traffic
volumes and delays that are projected by future growth to promote a pedestrian friendly
and multimodal downtown core. It is important to note that physical and operational
improvements should not be based on special event traffic volumes because resulting
requirements may be unreasonable; delays at and during special events are expected.
Rather, improvements are recommended based on their benefit during daily peak
periods and for safety benefits.

Alexandria has a well-connected street grid system that provides drivers with routing
options, especially during congested peak hours. This spreads the traffic burden from a
handful of intersections to many intersections within the system. The shared load on
multiple corridors also allows the City to avoid expanding street cross-sections to the
point that hinders pedestrian movement.

The findings of this traffic report will be incorporated into the master planning effort
currently underway.

5.1       Comparison of No-Build Actions with Build
The Waterfront development would increase traffic volumes and increase delays at all
six studied intersections in the area. However, the LOS and average delay per vehicle
change from No-Build to Build is negligible in most cases.

During the 2030 Build condition, the overall average intersection delay at the
Washington Street/Franklin Street intersection is projected to be almost 230 seconds
per vehicle. As described in the Recommendations chapter, drivers begin to use
parallel routes to a congested mainline when a grid pattern exists. This phenomenon
can be routinely observed throughout the City.

Additionally, congested intersections may be improved by a Level of Service letter
grade or more (i.e. LOS F to D) as multimodal transportation opportunities are
increased in the region. The study has assumed the same modal split for 2030 as
currently occurs in 2009. As alternative transportation means increase across the
region, the move away from SOV use will result in a ‘better’ modal split and
corresponding improvement in the LOS figures shown. Table 10 provides a comparison
of the LOS analysis results between the No-Build 2030 and Build 2030 scenarios.

I.     Site Location and Description

               The proposed Residential development is comprised of approximately 27.94 acres

       located in Section 7, Township 9 South, Range 3 East, Southeastern Land District, East

       of the Mississippi River, Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The site is further located on the

       southern right of way of Germany Road approximately 0.35 miles east of Airline

       Highway (U.S. 61) as shown on Exhibit 1, the Vicinity Map.

               The properties to the north, east, and southeast of the development are zoned as

       Medium Intensity, and are primarily residential. The residential properties to the north

       and east are large tracts with wooded areas and open pasture. The adjacent properties to

       the west and southwest are zoned as Mixed Use, and currently being used for auto and

       RV sales.

               The pre-developed site is primarily open pasture and the majority of the site

       drains to the ditch sloping east to west through the upper middle portion of the site. There

       is one (1) existing outfall ditch serving the property along the western boundary. A

       majority of the site drains to the main outfall ditch, either directly or via a tributary

       sloping south to north into the main outfall ditch. The property accepts runoff from

       several off-site drainage areas and adjacent properties. An existing cross-drain under

       Germany Road connects the north and south roadside ditches directly to an existing ditch

       that runs from north to south through the site, tying into the main outfall ditch. A portion

       of the lot to the northwest of the site also drains directly into the main outfall ditch. The

       existing conditions are depicted on Exhibit 4, Pre-Development Watershed Map.

               The proposed development plan for this property is to construct a combination of

       residential lots and apartments. The proposed subdivision will have 34 lots with varied

       dimensions, the proposed apartment complex will consist of 14 buildings containing 280

       units, and there is a park area for residents as shown in Exhibit 5, Post-Development

       Watershed Map. Preliminary Designs consist of two entrances, one a boulevard entrance

       from Germany Road with curb & gutter streets and subsurface drainage with the other

       from Airline Highway. Three proposed detention ponds will be utilized to reduce the 10-

       year post-development runoff from the site to the 10-year pre-development flow rate.

               The subject site is located within Flood Zones X and A as shown on the Flood

        Insurance Rate Map Number 22005C0040E attached as Exhibit 3. According to the

        FIRM map, this area is protected from the Mississippi River 1% annual chance flood

        hazard by levee, dike or other structure. Flood Zone A abuts the property line near the

        northwestern corner of the site. The Base Flood Elevation was estimated to be 16.0'

        based on the FEMA FIRM Panel, Exhibit 2. Site elevations range from 16’ near the

        ditch banks to 18.5’ at the perimeter of the site



II.    Design Considerations and Analysis

               The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how storm water management

       techniques will be utilized to mitigate the increase in flows from the proposed

       development. HydroCAD Storm Water Modeling Software was used for calculation

       purposes. This program combines both the capabilities of the Soil Conservation Service

       Method TR-20 and TR-55.          The flows produced by the 10-year Post-Development

       conditions will be mitigated to Pre-Development flows by utilizing a single storm water

       detention pond. A 24-hour storm of 10 and 100-year frequencies were analyzed and

       results can be found in the Appendices.

                 In order to minimize the impact due to the increased rate of storm water runoff

          from this project to the adjacent properties, existing and proposed conditions were

          analyzed. The SCS method was utilized to determine peak flows and hydrographs for

          each of these conditions. These peak flows and hydrographs were analyzed to design a

          storm water detention pond capable of performing the necessary detention. All detention

          facilities were designed based on a 10-year 24-hour storm as required by the Ascension

          Parish Drainage Ordinance.

                 The Pre-Development condition of this property is open pasture, in fair condition.

          The majority of the land slopes to the interior of the site where the main ditch lies, with

          the property draining to the outfall ditch on the western boundary. The outfall from this

          site travels west, then south through an existing cross-drain (2-4’x5’ RCBs) under Airline

          Highway, into Bayou Narcisse.

               As shown on the Pre-Development Watershed Map (Exhibit 3), Drainage Area 1S

       consists of the majority of the site, as well as some offsite area from properties adjacent

       to the south property line. Drainage Area 8S along the northern property line and sheet

       flows directly to the Germany Rd. roadside ditch. Germany Road is a 2-lane open ditch

       section. The southern roadside ditches provide drainage of the road Right-of-Way and

       some property frontage as indicated by Drainage Area 6S and 7S for approximately 350’

       west and 625’ east to the existing ditch that runs south and then west through the project

       site to Outfall Ditch 1. An existing 24” cross-drain under Germany Road also provides

       drainage for Drainage Area 3S, north of the road to the existing ditch that runs south

       through the project site to Outfall 1. Off-site Area 9S is comprised of two low-density

       residential properties that drain south to the existing site ditch and Outfall 1. The total

       10-year peak discharge for the 48.66 acre watershed to Outfall Ditch 1 is 86.9 cfs.



               Under Post-Development conditions, approximately 27.94 acres of the site will be

       multi-family residential apartments while the remaining 9.98 acres will be residential

       subdivision lots. The apartment complex area is considered as residential townhomes

       (65% impervious) with a CN value of 92, while the residential subdivision with 36 home

       sites is considered 1/4 acre lots (38% impervious) with a CN value of 87. Both CN

       values used are representative of soil type D. Appropriate CN values are applied to the

       developed site areas including the values listed above, pond water surfaces, green space

       and park areas. Storm water generated from the post-development condition will be

       captured in sub-surface drainage systems and routed to the proposed detention ponds.

          The apartment complex area generally drains to the parking lots where subsurface

          drainage systems will route the runoff to Ponds 1 and 3. The rear lot areas along the

          perimeter of the residential subdivision will be graded to subsurface drainage systems and

          tied to Pond 2. These conditions can be seen on the Post-Development Watershed Map,

          Exhibit 4.

                 The proposed detention pond system will reduce the 10-year post-development

          flow to pre-development levels. The Post-development 10-year and 100-year peak flows

          were calculated in the same method as the flows in the pre-development condition. All

          offsite flows will be the same as the flows generated in the pre-development condition.

          The Post-Development 10-year storm produces the peak flows shown in the table below:

       will utilize approximately 57,440 cubic feet of pond volume; have a peak 100-year water

       surface of 18.14, and a peak discharge of 27.20 cfs. An overflow weir with 8.0' crest

       with an invert of 17.50’ and 10:1 side slopes will connect the pond to the proposed 2-30”

       PVC culverts along the western boundary and on to Outfall Ditch 1.

               The mitigated on-site flows from the proposed pond will be directed to the

       existing Outfall Ditch 1 and on to Bayou Narcisse. The off-site areas from Germany

       Road will be directed to through the site via 2-30” PVC culverts to Outfall Ditch 1. The

       existing 24” RCP Germany Road Cross-Drain Culvert was analyzed for a 25-year storm

       event. The upstream water surface will be lowered from a Pre-development elevation of

       19.12 to a Post-Development elevation of 18.87. Cross-Drain calculations are included

       in Appendix C.

               The detention ponds will detain the flows from the developed areas so that the

       post development 10-year peak discharge will be less than the pre-development flows.

       Offsite areas will remain in their existing conditions and the flow received will be routed

       through the site, to the existing Outfall Ditches as shown in Exhibit 4, Post-Development

       Watershed Map. The calculations provided in Appendix B show that the proposed pond

       structures are adequately sized for these purposes.

               By use of the detention methods included herein, no increase in flow to any

       outfall will be allowed from this site. With the implementation of these measures, this

       watershed draining to Bayou Narcisse will have a total 10-year peak discharge of 61.29

       cfs, which is 25.61 cfs less than the pre-development peak discharge of 86.90 cfs.

III.   Recommendations and Conclusions

               The purpose of this Drainage Impact study is to identify the potential drainage

       impacts from the development of this project, and to demonstrate that the proposed storm

       water detention methods will result in no significant impacts to the surrounding drainage.

       The existing and proposed drainage conditions were analyzed and the results shown.

               As the computations indicate, the post-development 10-year peak flow contained

       within or passing through our project is 61.29 cfs. In fact, the project will result in a

       decrease in the 10-year peak discharge for the regional watershed of approximately

       25.61cfs. It is also demonstrated in the calculations that the 100-year storm event is

       contained within the proposed pond without over-topping the banks and maintaining a

       peak water surface that is less than the existing ground elevation. This hydrologic

       analysis concludes that this development with the aforementioned storm water

       management methods will not adversely impact the upstream or downstream properties.

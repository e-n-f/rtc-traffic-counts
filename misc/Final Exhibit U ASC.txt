This exhibit provides information about significant potential adverse impacts of construction and
operation of the proposed facility on the ability of public and private providers in the analysis
area to provide the services listed in Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 345-022-0110, and
evidence to support a finding that construction and operation are not likely to result in significant
adverse impacts. The proposed project is the 420 megawatt (MW) natural gas-fired South Dunes
Power Plant (SDPP) to be located on the North Spit in Coos Bay, in Coos County, Oregon.
Communities located within the 10-mile boundary of the analysis area are provided in Table

As described below, the proposed construction of the SDPP would have minimal adverse
impacts on public and private services and in many instances will greatly benefit public services.
Examples of benefits include an economic benefit from property taxes and workers spending in
the community, schools receiving funds for each student, and the Southwest Oregon Regional

       2.0 IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL
                                         IMPACTS

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(A). The important assumptions the applicant used to evaluate
potential impacts.

 To assess the impact of new development on public services, it is necessary to establish the level
of service currently provided to communities and to project how the level of service would
change as a result of the natural background population growth, in addition to the proposed
facility under evaluation. One way to establish the level of service is to compare the current
operating service levels to a set of public service standards. Regional or local standards for
public services are not available for the analysis area, which is a 10-mile radius of the project
location. Therefore, service system capacities (including sewers and sewage treatment, water
supply, stormwater drainage, solid waste management, housing, traffic safety, police and fire
protection, health care and schools) are described and estimated.

While an influx of approximately 500 personnel is expected during construction activities, it is
assumed that of the itinerant workers, few will move their families to Coos County due to the
fact that construction workers will only work for the time necessary to complete their
construction task. 2 Of the 500 anticipated construction workers, it is estimated that
approximately half will be local, i.e. living within North Bend or within commuting range of
North Bend. ECONorthwest’s analysis found that in 2011 there were 3,710 underemployed
trained construction workers within commuting distance of North Bend. However, not all
available workers in the local area are experienced in heavy construction. The estimated number
of local, available construction workers experienced in heavy construction is 1,076. 3 Given past
experience with construction of other power plants by the Applicant’s contractor Black and
Veatch, the availability of local experienced construction workers, the Applicant assumed that
approximately half the construction workforce, 200-300 workers, will be within commuting
distance of North Bend.

Following facility construction, it has been estimated that the SDPP will require a total of
approximately 45 full-time workers during facility operation. It is assumed that if availability of
public and private services were sufficient for 500 construction workers, that services would also
be adequate for 45 operational employees. It should be noted that the traffic impact analysis,
Appendix U-4, went beyond the 45 operational employees directly supporting the SDPP and
included an analysis of 90 operational employees. The additional 45 employees represent
employees supporting other nearby industrial facilities such as the gasification and LNG terminal
which are not directly related to operation of the SDPP.

Given the well-established public and private providers for the aforementioned systems and the
minimal public services the proposed facility would require during construction and operation, as
detailed throughout Exhibit U, it was assumed that the facility would not adversely impact a

particular service system if the system were currently operating below capacity. 4 Moreover, if a
system was reported to be operating at capacity and the public service provider had plans for
system expansion in the future, it was assumed that the proposed facility would not adversely
impact the planned system capacity. For example, the Coos Bay School District has plans for
new building configurations that may include additional school buildings if needed (Coos Bay
School District, 2014, Appendix U-3).

 This principal is generally applied throughout the exhibit and is specifically applied by ECONorthwest 2012,

Table U-2 identifies the public service and utility providers for the communities in the analysis
area that provide the essential governmental services listed in OAR 345-022-0110. The
following is a description of the public service providers within the communities in the analysis
area.

In addition to the community services listed in Table U-2, the project site has three other service
providers.
   • Water is provided by the Coos Bay North Bend Water Board (CBNBWB);
   • Wastewater is managed onsite and through the introduction of water into the industrial
     wastewater pipeline that runs from the Project site, through the Oregon International Port
     of Coos Bay’s (the “Port”) property, and to the Port’s ocean outfall facility. The water is
     then discharged from the Port’s ocean outfall facility; and
   • A public-use airport (Southwestern Oregon Regional Airport) is operated by the Coos
      County Airport District.

 3.1     SEWAGE AND INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND
         TREATMENT

 3.1.1 Construction
 A sanitation service would be contracted to provide and maintain portable toilets for the
 construction crew during construction. Maintenance will be determined following initial usage
 and adjusted according to the SDPP workforce at a given time. Sanitary wastes collected during
 periodic maintenance will be hauled off site to a permitted disposal facility.

 3.1.2 Operation
 It is anticipated that there will be approximately 45 permanent employees spread over three shifts
 daily. During operations, it is anticipated that sanitary wastewater will be managed onsite in a
 permitted onsite sewage disposal facility and disposed through the industrial wastewater
 pipeline. The volume of industrial wastewater is within the capabilities of the industrial
 wastewater pipeline.

 During operation of the SDPP, wastewaters would include heat recovery steam generator
 blowdown, water treatment wastes, filter backwash, and oil/water separator effluent.
 Wastewaters will be disposed of through the industrial wastewater pipeline or transported offsite
 if they are not suitable for disposal through the industrial wastewater pipeline. Wastewaters will
 be collected onsite and treated, if necessary, before disposal. Once the composition of the
 wastewaters is confirmed and the appropriate treatment applied, the treated wastewater will be
 discharged to the industrial wastewater pipeline which has a minimum estimated capacity of 3.6
 to 4 million gallons per day (gpd), significantly greater than the maximum estimated volume of
 wastewater from the SDPP (433,440 gpd).
EXHIBIT U
Public Services
OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)
Page 10

Wastewaters that are not suitable for pipeline discharge will be collected as a separate waste
stream and contained in on-site tanks designed for this operation or appropriate truck mounted
tanks. The waste water will be characterized for transportation and disposal options. Depending
on the final characterization of the wastewater’s chemical properties these volumes will be sent
offsite for treatment, storage, and or disposal. Both the City of Coos Bay and the City of North
Bend maintain approved wastewater treatment plants that could accept this wastewater. In
addition, PPV Inc., a wastewater treatment facility in Portland, Oregon, has more than adequate
capacity to accept JCEP’s anticipated wastewater. A written confirmation statement is provided
in Appendix O-5, which confirms PPV Inc.’s ability to receive wastewater from the SDPP. For
more detail regarding deposition of wastewater, see Exhibits O, Section 3.3 and V. No
significant adverse impacts to service providers are anticipated.

3.2    WATER SUPPLIES

3.2.1 Construction
Water required for construction activities would be purchased from the Coos Bay North Bend
municipal water system, which is managed by the Coos Bay North Bend Water Board
(CBNBWB). The purchased water for construction activities would include potable water
conveyed through one onsite connection to an existing 12-inch main. The potable water
connection would be permanent and used for operations. A separate, temporary, untreated water
connection from CBNBWB may also be installed to support construction activities; however, it
is anticipated that the potable water supply will be sufficient for all construction activities.

The source water for the potable water would be from the Dunes Aquifer Wellfield, which is
utilized for industrial and municipal purposes. The potable water used during construction
would be sourced from the Dunes Aquifer Wellfield and treated at the North Spit Water
Treatment Plant, which has a 1.0 million gallon per day (mgd) capacity. The Dunes Aquifer
Wellfield consists of 18 production wells, which can produce up to four million gallons per day
(gpd) of untreated water. 5 According to the December 29, 2009 CBNBWB Water Management
and Conservation Program, the CBNBWB maintains current water appropriation rights of 29.7
million gallons per day from the Dunes Aquifer Wellfield. 6 The CBNBWB has a system
capacity of 4,000 gpm. 7

The Applicant estimates approximately 32 million gallons of water would be required during the
39-month construction phase. Table U-3 identifies the construction activity and corresponding
estimated water usage rate. Details regarding construction water use are included in Exhibit O –
Water Use.

The untreated water, if a temporary connection is installed, would be used during construction
for dust control, washing equipment and vehicles, washing concrete trucks after delivery of

concrete loads, fire suppression during construction, and water supply for flushes, and testing
and commissioning. Potable water would be required for items such as ice machines, coolers,
and sinks for construction facilities to support construction personnel. Water may be trucked in
until the municipal connection is operational and bottled water will likely be available in the
construction trailers.

The applicant will emphasize water conservation to minimize losses during construction. Such
conservation measures include leak detection and repair, recovery, reuse and recycling. Some
waters will be lost, such as water used for dust control, civil work, and steam blow waters.
Chemical cleaning waters will be collected and transported offsite for treatment. Opportunities

will exist for reuse of some of the flushing and hydrostatic test waters for additional flushes or
testing.

Based upon the total estimated water use during construction, the CBNBWB system capacity,
and the Dunes Aquifer Wellfield production rate, there is sufficient water available for the
duration of construction. As such, no significant adverse impacts to water supply are
anticipated from construction of the project. A copy of the September 5, 2013 transmittal letter
is included in Exhibit 0 – Water Use, Appendix O-1 Letter from the Coos Bay North Bend Water
Board.

3.2.2 Operation
Water required for operation of the SDPP would be purchased from the CBNBWB municipal
water system.

The source water for the potable water would be from primarily from the Dunes Aquifer
Wellfield, which is utilized for industrial and municipal purposes. The potable water purchased
for operations would be sourced from the Dunes Aquifer Wellfield and treated at the North Spit
Water Treatment Plant, which has a 1.0 million gallon per day (mgd) capacity. Additional
treated water is available from the Pony Creek Filtration Plant, which has a capacity of 12 MGD.
The current peak treated water demand for the CBNBWB system is 6.02 MGD. Details
regarding the water source for operations are the same as that for construction.

The primary consumptive uses of water during SDPP operation would be for steam cycle make-
up water and pollution control; nitrous oxide (NOx) control injection water, both uses are for
demineralized water. The treated source water would be demineralized onsite. Potable water,
Storm Water service water, and fire water supply are comparatively minor uses.

Average daily operational water use is estimated at 806,400 gallons per day (gpd). The estimate
for potable and sanitary systems use is approximately 4,300 gpd and is based on a 24-hour daily
staff of 45 full time equivalents spread over three shifts per day. The estimated average and
maximum daily operational water uses are summarized in Table U-4. Details regarding water
use during operations are included in Exhibit O – Water Use.

Based upon the total estimated water use during operations, the CBNBWB system capacity, and
the Dunes Aquifer Wellfield production rate, there is sufficient water available for operation of
the SDPP. Further, in a letter dated September 5, 2013, the CBNBWB states that it can provide
two, permanent potable water service connections and one, permanent raw water service.3 The
CBNBWB also states that the community’s water supply and production needs, and the
Applicant’s water availability needs are comfortably accounted for.3 As such, no significant
adverse impacts to water sources are expected from operation of the project. A copy of the
September 5, 2013 transmittal letter is included in Exhibit 0 – Water Use, Appendix O-1 Letter
from the Coos Bay North Bend Water Board.

3.3    STORM WATER

3.3.1 Construction
Storm water runoff will not occur during most of the construction activities due to the high
infiltration rate of the sandy soils on the SDPP site. Further discussion of soil conditions and
infiltration is presented in Exhibit I and Exhibit V, where it is shown that the SDPP site is
predominantly sand and that infiltrometer test results of the soils in March 2013 demonstrated
that storm water will be infiltrated into the sand backfill. During the latter months of
construction, as impervious surfaces in parking lots and roofed building areas increase, storm
water that does not contact industrial process or hydrocarbon sources will be collected in
drainage swales to infiltrate, evaporate, or be directed to the storm water infiltration pond. Any
storm water that contacts hydrocarbon sources will be contained and directed to oil/water
separators before discharge to the existing industrial wastewater pipeline.

The existing industrial wastewater pipeline extends generally east to west along the north side of
the north property boundary and conveys wastewater to the Port’s ocean outfall. The industrial
wastewater pipeline is capable of conveying 3.6 to 4.0 million gpd. 9

The volume of construction storm water that is discharged to the industrial wastewater pipeline
will be limited to storm water that contacts pollutants other than those allowed by the
Construction Stormwater Discharge Permit (1200-C). It is anticipated that such storm waters
will be significantly less than the carrying and outfall capacity of the industrial wastewater
pipeline; therefore no significant adverse impacts are anticipated.

8
  The quantity of demineralized water in the Average Use and Maximum Use columns does not add up to 493 and
635, respectively, due to the process of demineralizing water and disposal of concentrates.

3.3.2 Operation
Following construction, disturbed areas of the site will be stabilized, using approved erosion
control measures, until vegetation is reestablished or permanent cover is applied. Non-contact
storm water that does not immediately infiltrate, will be conveyed through a series of vegetated
ditches/swales and underground storm water pipe before discharging into the new storm water
infiltration pond. Biofilters will be installed in ditches at specific locations around the site
perimeter. The biofilters will convey and allow the infiltration of storm water and will also
remove contaminants from storm water.

Storm water that comes into contact with, or has the potential to contact, hydrocarbons will be
discharged to the industrial wastewater pipeline. Such waters will be diverted to an oil/water
separator that will discharge into a new sump before being routed to the industrial wastewater
pipeline.

As noted previously, the industrial wastewater pipeline is capable of conveying 3.6 to 4.0 million
gpd. It is estimated that the maximum daily volume of process wastewater discharged to the
industrial wastewater pipeline will not exceed 433,440 gpd (refer to Figure O-1). Contact storm
water discharged to the industrial wastewater pipeline will be significantly less than the
remaining capacity of the pipeline (3.5 million gallons), so no significant adverse impacts to the
industrial wastewater pipeline are anticipated.

3.4   SOLID WASTE

3.4.1 Construction
During SDPP construction, a variety of non-hazardous, inert materials would be generated.
Solid waste would consist of materials such as domestic refuse, office waste, packaging
materials (e.g., pallets, cardboard, packing paper, steel banding), steel cut-offs, and construction
materials such as concrete waste, wood, plastic, glass, erosion control materials, and
miscellaneous debris. Only materials that cannot be recycled will become wastes. Paper
products (including office waste and packaging), wood, most erosion control materials, metals,
glass, and plastics will be sorted and recycled. It is estimated that approximately five tons per
month of solid waste would be produced during construction, which is estimated to be
approximately 39 months.

Non-hazardous waste that cannot be recycled would be transported to an approved landfill and is
expected to have a minimal impact on the local community as multiple regional solid waste
providers are prepared to ship solid waste to landfills outside Coos County. While the final
disposal site has not been determined, one option is the Dry Creek Landfill in Eagle Point,
Jackson County, located about 180 miles southwest of the proposed SDPP project site, which is
available for non-hazardous solid waste. The Dry Creek Landfill also offers recycling services
and accepts approved construction debris, which will be separated from other non-hazardous
wastes. Two other regional solid waste companies have indicated that their operations have
capacity to meet this solid waste disposal demand. These include Republic Services in Corvallis,
OR and Waste Management in Arlington, OR. A summary of the identified waste disposal

Written confirmation demonstrating that the identified waste disposal facilities have adequate
capacity available to receive waste from the SDPP is provided in Appendix U-1.

With regard to hazardous wastes, the SDPP is expected to be either a small quantity generator
(SQG), a SQG produces more than 100 kilograms per month (kg/mo) but less than 1000 kg/mo,
or a conditionally-exempt small quantity generator (CESQG) of hazardous wastes (a CESQG
produces less than 100 kg/mo) during both construction and operation. At a production rate of
less than 100 kg/mo to up to a maximum of 1000 kg/mo, fewer than one truckload of hazardous
waste would be transported every three months. Quantities during construction will vary from
zero generation to potentially more than 100kg/mo depending on construction and
commissioning activities underway during a given month, but is not anticipated by the Applicant
to exceed 1000 kg/mo in any given month of construction. Factors which may cause a variance
in the amount of waste are periodic or seasonal maintenance or repairs. One example of this is
that cleaning operations will result in an accumulation of waste at a ‘satellite accumulation area’
next to the maintenance process. When the accumulated volume finally exceeds 55-gallon
drums, the drum will need to be sealed and the operator has three days to move the drum from
the ‘satellite accumulation area’ to the storage area. For a SQG or a CESQG, accumulation of
55-gallons of hazardous waste may take several months.
EXHIBIT U
Public Services
OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)
Page 16

Unless recycled, potential wastes would include oily rags, spent batteries, and equipment and
vehicle maintenance solvents and oils.

Hazardous wastes will be segregated from and kept in a separate storage area away from non-
hazardous materials. Waste storage areas will be inspected at least weekly and wastes will be
removed from the project site by licensed transporters to landfills permitted to accept the wastes.
The hazardous waste disposal sites to be used by the SDPP have not been selected at this time.
However, there are currently three permitted commercial hazardous waste facilities within
reasonable proximity to the SDPP and are operated by Chemical Waste Management, U.S.
Ecology (formerly EnviroSafe Services), and Clean Harbors (formerly Laidlaw) 10 (located in
Oregon, Idaho, and Utah, respectively) and all three are available to receive hazardous waste
from the SDPP (CWM, 2014; U.S. Ecology, 2014; Clean Harbors, 2014). A summary of the
identified waste disposal facilities and their capacity to receive waste is included above in Table
U-5. Written confirmation demonstrating that the identified waste disposal facilities have
adequate capacity available to receive hazardous waste from the SDPP is included in Appendix
U-1.

The use of hazardous materials will be kept to a minimum, and wastes will be recycled to the
extent practicable. Please refer to Exhibit V for a discussion of the waste minimization program.

3.4.2 Operation
Non-hazardous solid waste generated during operation would not have significant adverse
impacts to communities in the analysis area. As discussed in Exhibit V, solid waste generation is
expected to be approximately ten tons per year. Transportation and disposal services for such
waste will be contracted to a local provider, which currently includes Waste Management, Waste
Connections/Dry Creek Landfill, and Republic. Non-hazardous solid waste is transported by
Waste Connections to the Dry Creek Landfill, which has an estimated capacity of 65,512,400
tons (Dry Creek, 2014), Waste Management has an estimated capacity of 143 years of life
remaining for their Columbia Ridge Landfill and Recycling Center (WM, 2014), and Republic
Services has approximately 40 years of capacity remaining at their Coffin Butte Landfill
(Republic, 2014). Because the three disposal services for solid waste have capacity to accept the
aforementioned quantities of waste and the SDPP is only expected to generate 10 tons per year,
there is adequate capacity to accept solid waste generated by the SDPP with no significant
impact to disposal service providers. Written confirmation demonstrating that the identified
waste disposal facilities have adequate capacity available to receive hazardous waste from the
SDPP is included in Appendix U-1. A summary of the identified waste disposal facilities and
their capacity to receive waste is included above in Table U-5.

As discussed above, the amount of hazardous waste produced during operation of the facility is
expected to allow the site to be designated as either a SQG or a CESQG (see Exhibits E and V).
While the hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities have not been selected, the closest
sites include facilities in Oregon, Idaho, and Utah. Transportation services would be provided by
licensed hazardous waste transporters.

     Clean Harbors purchased the disposal facility in 2005.

In summary, waste materials will not have significant adverse impacts during construction or
operation for the following reasons:

      • The Applicant assumes that a waste minimization program will recycle materials, monitor
         waste production to reduce wastes, and replace hazardous materials with non-hazardous
         options whenever suitable replacements are available. This program will reduce volumes
         of wastes produced (both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes) at the SDPP. The
         program and production rates are further described in Exhibit V.
      • The anticipated volumes of non-hazardous and hazardous waste generated during
         construction and operation of the SDPP has been minimized, so the additional trips per
         month between the site and disposal facilities will not have an adverse impact on the
         transportation network.
      • In addition to the Dry Creek Landfill, which may be used for disposal of construction
          debris or other non-hazardous wastes, there are other DEQ- permitted landfills that could
          be used.
      • Other facilities provide specialized services (e.g., used oil, composting of wood and
         vegetative debris, tires, metals, and paper recycling) providing options other than disposal
         for most non-hazardous waste.
      • As either a small quantity or conditionally-exempt small quantity generator of hazardous
         waste, the low frequency of “trips” from the site to offsite disposal sites will not result in
         significant adverse impacts.
      • The hazardous waste disposal facilities considered for this application are large
         commercial facilities located well outside the analysis area. The volume of waste
         generated by the SDPP would represent an insignificant increase in the waste managed at
         these sites.

For additional details, see Exhibits V and W.

3.5     POLICE AND FIRE

The Southwest Oregon Resource Security Center (SORSC) to be located off Jordan Cove Road,
west of the main body of the SDPP site, will provide security, fire protection, and emergency
services. The SORSC is regulated under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and as
such, is not considered a supporting or related facility under the Energy Facility Siting Council’s
jurisdiction. In accordance with the June 2014 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between
Jordan Cove Energy Project (JCEP) and the State of Oregon, the SORSC personnel and
equipment will be in place 30 days prior to operation of the SDPP. The MOU requires JCEP to
provide funding at the county level for a fire training center as well as analysis of the available
resources. 11 The proposed construction schedule is to begin work in 2016, and complete the


11
  Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement No. 14-008 by and between Jordan Cove Energy Project and the
State of Oregon for LNG Emergency Preparedness dated June 10, 2014. Attached as Exhibit B, Appendix B-1.

SDPP in September of 2019, with peak construction occurring during summer of 2018. 12
Construction of the SORSC would be concurrent with or prior to the SDPP construction.

During construction, the average number of construction personnel for the 39-month
construction duration is estimated to be 500. 13 It is further estimated that approximately 50
percent of the construction work force will be hired locally (Appendix U-7). 14 In the case of
locally hired construction personnel (200 to 300 individuals), there would be no significant
impact to police or fire because that population would already be included with and accounted
for in terms of emergency response complying with state or federal staffing levels.

Similarly, it is possible that approximately 200 to 300 construction personnel would be from
distances such that those workers would temporarily relocate during construction, but the skills
and staffing needed will vary during the 39-month construction duration. Local police and fire
departments would be dispatched in the event of an emergency, but the need of such responses is
expected to be minimal.

 The Coos County 2013 population estimate is 62,282. 15 As previously mentioned, it is
estimated that up to 300 construction personnel would temporarily relocate for the duration of
their construction assignment at the SDPP; temporarily increasing the Coos County population to
62,582. This is a temporary population increase of approximately one percent. Because the
increase is only one percent, the impact is anticipated to be negligible; thus, no significant
adverse impacts on county police or fire departments listed below are anticipated during
construction.

The above information pertains to the county level because it is not known in which
communities the temporarily relocated construction workers would reside. Further, it is unlikely
that all temporarily relocated construction workers would reside exclusively within either Coos
Bay or North Bend. If as many as 300 construction personnel temporarily relocated exclusively
to Coos Bay or North Bend, it is expected that those personnel would reside in houses or hotels
that are already established and represented in the city’s police and fire department staffing
levels. Thus, no significant adverse impacts to city police or fire departments listed below are
expected during construction.

Construction of the SORSC must be completed prior to operation of the JCEP facilities. As
such, the SDPP will have security and emergency responders at the time of operations. It is
estimated that there will be approximately 45 total personnel over three shifts per day during
operations of the SDPP. It is possible that, depending upon the emergency at SDPP, County

and/or city police and/or fire department personnel could be dispatched to support emergency
responders from the SORSC. No significant impacts to county or city police or fire departments
listed below are expected due to operation of the SDPP because the SORSC will have personnel
and firefighting apparatus. At a minimum the SORSC will have at least three pumpers, one
ladder truck (or a combination apparatus with equivalent capabilities), other specialized
apparatus as may be needed, no fewer than 16 firefighters, one chief officer, one safety officer,
and a Rapid Intervention Team (four - five fire fighters on standby at event scene) as required by
the MOU, attached as Appendix B-1, Section V(1)(a).

3.5.1 Coos County Sheriff’s Office
The Coos County Sheriff’s Office is headquartered in Coquille (the County Seat of Coos
County), approximately 17 miles from the project site. The Sheriff’s Office provides police
services to the residents of Coos County not located within cities. Coos County covers an area of
approximately 1,596 square miles (US Census Bureau Quick Facts, 21 November 2012). Coos
County reports to have 25 full time police officers and 17 other police employees. 16 The
category of other police employees includes one supervisor and 11 dispatchers.

Emergency dispatch services for Coos County are provided by the County Communications
Center located at the Sheriff’s Office. The dispatch center operates 24-hours a day and provides
the county with 911 capabilities for fire, police, and medical emergencies (Coos County, County
website. http://www.co.coos.or.us, Accessed 21 November 2012). In addition to the emergency
communications center, the County Sheriff's Office provides law enforcement services and
supports the County Courthouse, serving papers and assuring security to the court
(http://www.co.coos.or.us/departments/sheriffoffice.aspx).

3.5.2 Coos County Fire Protection Districts
Coos County has several rural fire protection districts, with the closest one, the Hauser Rural Fire
Protection District, located to the north beyond the study area. The Hauser Rural Fire Protection
District has a volunteer staff of one paramedic, four emergency medical technicians, and 14 first
responders (Hauser Fire and Rescue, 2012). The SDPP site is located outside of their district and
is not expected to have any impacts to the services provided to the district.

3.5.3 City of Coos Bay Police Department
The City of Coos Bay Police Department is responsible for all law enforcement activities within
the City of Coos Bay. The Department contains 38 staff members. The department includes the
Chief of Police and 18 officers, plus three Detectives, one Traffic Enforcement Officer, and a
School Resource Officer. Non-sworn staff and volunteers are used in the Communications
Division, which operates the 911 system (Coos Bay Police Department, 2012).

3.5.4 City of Coos Bay Fire Department
The City of Coos Bay Fire and Rescue Department has two manned stations and a third,
unmanned facility, known as the Eastside Station. The department is made up of the Fire Chief,
three Battalion Chiefs, three Lieutenants, nine career firefighters/ engineers, and 15 volunteer
firefighters. Additionally, there are opportunities for student firefighters enrolled in the fire
science program at Southwestern Community College (Coos Bay Fire Department, 2012).

3.5.5 City of North Bend Police Department
The City of North Bend Police Department is responsible for all law enforcement activities
within the City of North Bend and is comprised of the Patrol Division, with 14 uniformed
officers, plus the Detective Division, Administration, Dispatch, Records and Communications,
and the K-9 Unit. The Department also contains Reserve Officers. There are a minimum of two
to four officers on duty per shift (North Bend Police Department, 2012).

3.5.6 City of North Bend Fire Department
The North Bend Fire Department includes 11 paid personnel, the Chief, an Assistant Chief, a
Captain, three shift Lieutenants, and 6 firefighters. Additionally, there are 32 trained volunteer
firefighters available to respond to calls (North Bend Fire Department, 2012).

3.5.7 State Police
The Oregon State Police number 672 personnel. 17 There is an Oregon State Police Coos Bay
Area Command post, which is located in North Bend. They patrol state highways and provide
services to support local communities with a variety of programs, including forensic services,
computerized data, emergency response, and other specialized services.

Given the ample resources listed above and the small overall population increase of construction
workers (approximate population increase of 1 percent), and that the SDPP will have their own
designated response facility during operations (the SORSC), the Applicant will not have an
adverse impact on police and fire departments in the community.

3.6    HEALTH CARE

Coos County has a population of 63,043 people spread over 1,600 square miles, which is an
average of 39.5 people per square mile. 18 An analysis of the available health care resources in
the vicinity of Coos Bay and North Bend was conducted to determine the potential effect on the
available resources during both the construction and operation phases of the SDPP.

The analysis indicated that the available health care resources can handle the routine medical
emergencies that commonly occur during the construction and operation of the SDPP project
without taxing the available resources or lowering the level of care that is currently available to

Coos Bay and North Bend. More complicated cases would be dealt with through medical
evacuation to resources in Portland or other larger cities nearer to Coos Bay and North Bend.

An analysis of facilities found that there are 3 acute care hospitals in Coos County, with a total of
171 beds currently existing and 223 beds currently licensed by the state. Within the City of Coos
Bay, the Bay Area Hospital is licensed for 172 beds and currently has 130 existing beds for acute
care (Bay Area Hospital, 2014).

The Bay Area Hospital in Coos Bay is an accredited medical facility located approximately 6
miles from the SDPP project site. This facility completed a major expansion in February 2013.
The facility has more than 1,000 employees and 130 physicians 19. It is capable of handling all
routine and all but the most severe emergency medical needs of personnel during construction
and operation of the SDPP (Bay Area Hospital, 2012). The Bay Area Hospital offers the
following medical services:

Additionally, the North Bend Medical Center has a clinic located in Coos Bay (North Bend
Medical Center, 2012). Both facilities are located south of the project site. Two additional
hospitals, the Lower Umpqua Hospital and Coquille Valley Hospital, are also located within
close proximity to the SDPP at distances of approximately 20 miles north and 25 miles south,
respectively. A summary of the number of beds available at each of the aforementioned
hospitals is included in Table U-6 below. Written confirmation from each of the hospitals
regarding the number of licensed and available beds is provided in Appendix U-2.

Hospital capacity confirmation statements are provided in Appendix U-2.

A Community Health Assessment comparing Coos County to the national benchmark and
Oregon hospitals states that the county is classified as a Medically Underserved Area,
particularly for service needs for low income, homeless, and those with mental health issues 20.
The report indicates that the capacity to provide adequate medical care is particularly acute for
rural residents in Coos County that may not have ready access to hospitals and clinics in the
county. The report discusses access to healthcare, but also community issues (e.g., chronic
illness management, dental health, maternal and child health, mental health, socioeconomic
disparities, illness prevention, and lack of transportation from rural areas to healthcare
providers). While such a broad discussion is valuable from a community perspective and
contributed to the determination that the County is “medically underserved”, most of these
factors would not be exacerbated during construction or operation, due to the small number of
out-of-town workers and the fact that the employees will be highly-skilled experts in their field
and will be gainfully employed and thus, are highly unlikely to fall into the above socioeconomic
factors and categories listed above.

The local medical facilities, including three acute care hospitals in Coos County, capable of handling
all routine and all but the most severe emergency medical needs of personnel during construction
and operation of the SDPP with a total of 171 beds currently existing and 223 beds currently licensed
by the state, have the capacity to address any increase in patients during construction or operation
of the SDPP. Specifically, the Bay Area Hospital, located nearest the SDPP project site at a
distance of approximately 6 miles, reported that it has adequate capacity with 130 beds currently
staffed and could potentially increase their capacity to 172 beds per their existing state issued
license. In the event of a natural disaster or catastrophic event, the Bay Area Hospital can
temporarily increase their capacity with tent triage (Bay Area Hospital, 2014). The Southern
Coos Hospital and Health Center, the second nearest hospital to the SDPP project site at a
distance of approximately 20 miles, is a rural hospital that could presently staff 16 beds and
could potentially increase their capacity to 21 beds per their existing state issued license. In the
event of a natural disaster or a catastrophic event, the Southern Coos Hospital and Health Center
can temporarily increase their capacity with a triage tent equipped with an additional 6 beds

(Southern Coos Bay 2014). The Coquille Valley Hospital, the third nearest hospital to the SDPP
project site at a distance of approximately 25 miles, can presently staff 25 beds and could
potentially increase their capacity to 30 beds per their existing state issued license. In the event
of a natural disaster or catastrophic event, the Coquille Valley Hospital can temporarily increase
their capacity with tent triage (Coquille Valley Hospital, 2014). Written confirmation of the
aforementioned hospital’s capacities is included in Appendix U-2.

 Jordan Cove management personnel and/or construction managers will choose an Engineering,
Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor(s) with a satisfactory safety record to complete
the SDPP project. Such contractors routinely have an environmental health and safety program,
accident prevention, and other programs in place to minimize both the chance of injuries as well
as the severity of such injuries, thereby minimizing the need for emergency services or the
support from local health care services in Coos County.

Significant adverse impacts to the availability of community health services are not anticipated
because:
      • Due to the short duration of construction assignments (typically less than one year), the
         population increases will mostly be limited to construction workers (family members
         generally will not relocate to construction area);
      • The project will result in only an additional 500 personnel throughout the entire
         construction period and approximately 45 personnel during facility operation. It should
         be noted that the average personnel present during construction will be fewer than 500, it
         will only be during the peak construction period during the summer of 2018 where all
         500 may be present. It is expected that 200 to 300 of the construction personnel will be
         local hires and some of the new full-time operation personnel will already reside in the analysis
         area; therefore, the expected population increase of less than 1 percent will be temporary;
      • The Bay Area Hospital is the largest coastal hospital in Oregon. Public and private health
         care providers in the Coos Bay/North Bend area include 3 hospitals with 218 beds and 1
         public health clinic; and
      • The firms selected as the contractors for the project will be those that can demonstrate a
         consistent exemplary safety culture.

3.7      PUBLIC EDUCATION

The SDPP construction site is within the North Bend School District. See Figure U-1, which
illustrates the North Bend and Coos Bay School District boundaries. The nearest school to the
SDPP site is Oregon Virtual Academy, about 1.5 miles south of the site in North Bend. At that
distance, and in particular since it is an online school with no students on site, it is unlikely that
the construction and operation of the SDPP would have any effect on the school. The nearest
school with students on site is North Bend High School, approximately 2 miles south of the
south end of the project site.

Given the temporary nature of the SDPP construction project, it is unlikely that much of the non-
local construction workforce would take up residence with their school-age children. It is
estimated that the entire Jordan Cove Energy Project will add an additional 22 school-age
children to the public school system during the first school year, and approximately 125 students
during the subsequent two school years. It is expected that a fraction of the aforementioned
school-age children will be related to the construction of the SDPP (Appendix U-5). 21 According
to the Oregon Department of Education, the number of student enrollments in the Coos Bay
School Districts has fallen from 2007 to 2014 by 506 students. 22 In the North Bend School
District, from 2007 to 2014, the number of student enrollments increased by 1,901. All but 200
of the increased students were enrolled at the Oregon Virtual Academy. 23

It is estimated that approximately 45 permanent full-time positions will be provided during
operation of the SDPP, with many from the local area. The local schools have adequate
resources to serve their school-age children. The influx of construction workers for the proposed
facility could result in some families moving to the area, and permanent employees required to
operate the generating station could also impact local schools. While additional staff will be
required for periodic maintenance of the SDPP, the short-term nature of such maintenance would
not result in a permanent staffing increase or the addition of school-age children in the system.

Due to the staffing numbers, no significant adverse effects are expected, as capacity exists in
each of the potentially affected school districts, as described below. The decline in school-aged
population for North Bend, Coos Bay, and Coos County are summarized in Table U-7.

3.7.1 North Bend School District
The North Bend School District has three elementary schools (one is a charter school), a middle
school, a high school, a technology magnet school, and an online school (North Bend School
District, 2012). The North Bend School District has a maximum capacity of 4,056 students and
2,480 students are currently enrolled. Specifically, Hillcrest Elementary School has a capacity of
594 students with 478 students currently enrolled, North Bay Elementary School has a capacity
of 870 students with 444 students currently enrolled, North Bend Middle School has a capacity
of 992 students with 767 students currently enrolled, and North Bend High School has a capacity
of 1,600 students with 739 students currently enrolled (North Bend School District, 2014).
Based on the numbers provided, the North Bend School District has a 64 percent potential for
growth, while the SDPP project is expected to cause an increase of less than 2 percent of school-
age children in the North Bend School District. Therefore, the SDPP is not expected to have any
significant adverse effects on the local public education system. Written confirmation regarding
the North Bend School District capacity is provided in Appendix U-3.

3.7.2 Coos Bay School District
The Coos Bay School District has two K-3 primary grades, two intermediate schools for grades 4
through 7, and one high school serving grades 8 through 12 (Coos Bay School District, 2012).
According to the Coos Bay School District, 3,131 students were enrolled as of October 2014 and
two of their elementary schools were at capacity. Based on projections, the District is
considering reopening a school in 2015 that was closed in 2011. Additionally, another
previously closed school could be brought back into use with some capital improvements. With
the existing facilities and the reopening of the two previously closed facilities, the Coos Bay
School District could accommodate an increase of 600 to 700 students (Coos Bay School
District, 2014). Based on the numbers provided, the Coos Bay School District has a 46 percent
to 53 percent potential for growth, while the SDPP project is expected to cause an increase of
less than 2 percent of school-age children in the Coos Bay School District. Therefore, the SDPP
project is not expected to have an adverse impact on the local public education system. Written
confirmation regarding the Coos Bay School District capacity is provided in Appendix U-3.

3.8    HOUSING

There are approximately 11,775 housing units within the cities of Coos Bay and North Bend.
Based on 2009 to 2011 estimates, on average, there are a total of 7,325 housing units in Coos
Bay and 4,450 units in North Bend. Coos County contained 30,593 units, with 3,977 as vacant
units (a 13% vacancy rate) (US Census, 2010). Housing availability and supply in the analysis
area is described in Table U-9.

It is estimated that an average of 500 workers would be at the SDPP site during the 39 month
construction. Somewhere between 40% and 60% of the construction workers would likely be
hired locally (200 to 300 workers would not be local hires). 26 Thus, no housing issues would be

26
  This is based upon Black & Veatch’s experience with other construction projects in mid-sized Oregon
communities and number of available experienced construction workers, see Section 2.0.

Page 26

created for those workers. As work progresses, it is estimated that the average worker would be
on site for about 12 months. In that situation, most workers would seek temporary
accommodations available within a commuting distance of the SDPP site. The Applicant has
approval for a conditional use permit and variance for temporary workforce housing to
accommodate construction workers that was approved by the City of North Bend Planning
Commission.27 (City of North Bend, CUP-1-14 and VAR-1-14.) The temporary workforce
housing would accommodate 2,100 construction workers, which is more than adequate to house
all construction workers for the SDPP. It is expected that temporary workers will either live in
their existing community within the region or obtain temporary housing in the region, such as the
temporary workforce housing.

Coos County population grew by a negligible amount (0.4%) between 2000 and 2010, but it is
still about 1,000 residents below its 1980 population. Of the existing housing units in Coos
County, there is a vacancy rate of 11.3% or about 3,460 non-seasonal vacancies in housing units
available for workers. In addition, there are about 1,236 available motel and other temporary
housing units within Coos County. 28

Not all workers will use housing units. Many workers from out of the local area are expected to
bring campers or trailers and use the many campgrounds and trailer parks for their housing
during construction. The following is a list of recreational vehicle sites within 75-minutes of
North Bend, Oregon. 29

In summary, there is adequate housing stock in the Coos County/Coos Bay/North Bend area to
accommodate the work force during construction of the SDPP. Operation of a gas-fired power
plant involves relatively few people, approximately 45 full-time jobs. Housing in the Coos
Bay/North Bend area should be able to accommodate this workforce without significant or
adverse impacts.

In summary, the proposed SDPP would impose no new demand on local utility and service
providers for either construction-related or operation-related needs. As described, the facility
would be supplied with process, cooling, and potable water from the CBNBWB that has ample
capacity to provide these services. Storm water run-off will be managed onsite.

Construction workers from outside the region would be utilized as needed. However, it is likely
that many personnel will be able to commute from permanent residences during the week, and
that the existing industrial base/ skilled labor in the region will be an important component to the
labor used on the SDPP project.

In general, it is not anticipated that workers would bring their families because of the short
duration of the work. The addition of a small number of temporary residents to the analysis area
is expected to have no adverse impact on the demand for water supply, sewerage service, health
care, and police and fire services.
EXHIBIT U
Public Services
OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)
Page 29

The proposed energy facility will create about 45 full-time jobs per day over the course of the
lifetime of the facility. The new jobs would pay considerably above the average wage and would
likely be attractive to current residents. It is expected that some of the new employees already
reside in the analysis area. Creation of the new jobs would have a minimal effect on the demand
for local services.

3.9   TRAFFIC

Construction and Operation: Access to the SDPP site will be from the TransPacific Parkway
via Oregon Coast Highway (US 101). The TransPacific Parkway also provides access to each of
the industries on the North Spit, as well as to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The
intersection of the TransPacific Parkway and US 101 (approximately one mile east of the site) is
not currently signalized. As discussed in Appendix U-2, the increase in traffic demands would
have no significant impacts to traffic on US 101 as a result of construction or operations from the
SDPP facility. Affected intersections along both TransPacific Parkway and US 101 are expected
to meet all jurisdictional standards both during construction and operation of the SDPP facility.
There will be no need for additional police services to assist in the direction of traffic at the
SDPP site entrance on TransPacific Parkway or at the intersection of TransPacific Parkway and
US 101. Therefore, no adverse impacts from traffic would be expected to public and private
facilities that are accessed from US-101.

During construction, facility-related traffic would consist of material deliveries arriving on site
and construction workers. It is anticipated that construction of the SDPP would last
approximately 36-39 months, and employ up to 500 workers maximum (across multiple shifts)
during the peak of construction. Because of the number of workers required and the lack of
available parking areas near the SDPP site, workers will predominantly be transported to the site
by approximately 13 buses or other transit vehicle, alleviating a large influx of vehicle traffic at
shift changes. Buses would arrive from the south along US 101.

One potential impact to traffic safety was recognized resulting from construction of SDPP at
TransPacific Parkway where it intersects with US 101. Specifically, the increase in expected
vehicle trips heading eastbound along TransPacific Parkway are expected to result in an increase
in queue lengths approaching US 101. An increase in queue lengths corresponds to an increase
in vehicle delay. As delays increase typical drivers will begin to accept smaller gaps in traffic
which can result in an increase in crashes. To mitigate this potential safety concern, it is
proposed that TransPacific Parkway be widened to include separate lanes for vehicles turning
left (northbound) and right (southbound) onto US 101. As a result of this improvement, visitors
leaving private and public facilities accessed via TransPacific Parkway will experience a safer,
more convenient transition as they head east on TransPacific Parkway and then onto US 101.
Visitors traveling to private and public facilities via TransPacific Parkway would be unaffected
by the lane widening as traffic flow would be maintained as it is currently. For these reasons, no
adverse impacts to private and public facilities resulting from construction traffic at TransPacific
Parkway are expected, and in fact, road improvements would benefit visitors as they left public
and private facilities along the North Spit.

Page 30

As demonstrated in Appendix U-4, the SDPP Traffic Impact Analysis memorandum, regular
SDPP operations are expected to require about 45-90 employees daily while the construction of
the SDPP is expected to require about 500 workers daily at the peak of construction in the
summer of 2018. The impacts associated with construction far outweigh the impacts associated
with regular plant operations (i.e. the number of operations employees are less than two-tenths of
the construction employees), and because there are no mitigations required for the impacts
associated with construction, there will be no mitigations nor adverse impacts to traffic on US
101 or the TransPacific Parkway during the operations phase . Other identified public and
private facilities, are located at a great enough distance from the US 101/TransPacific Parkway
intersection as to be unaffected by construction or operational traffic flows related to the SDPP.
Therefore, increased traffic resulting from SDPP construction or operations will not result in
significant impacts to public or private facilities.

3.10 AIR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
The Southwest Oregon Regional Airport (SORA) is located in North Bend, approximately one
mile south of the SDPP (refer to Figure C-1). The SORA is operated by the Coos County
Airport District as a public-use facility and has commercial, corporate, and general aviation
services, as well as related support facilities (e.g., ground transportation, aircraft re-fueling,
travel agents, a small business development center). The FAA issued Determinations of No
Hazard in response to the 7460-Forms, Notices of Proposed Construction which the Applicant
submitted to the FAA. The Notices of Proposed Construction and FAA No Hazard
Determinations are attached to Exhibit E, Appendix E-6 and E-7, respectively.

3.10.1 Construction
The applicant has submitted the required Notices of Proposed Construction or Alteration (form
7460-1) to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2013 for the proposed SDPP. In
addition, the notices were submitted to the Oregon Department of Aviation. These notices
included the structures for the SDPP as well as the transmission line along the utility corridor.
Submittal of these forms allows the FAA to evaluate the effect of the construction on operating
procedures, determine any potential hazards to air navigation, chart new objects (in this case the
SDPP and transmission line structures), and determine appropriate mitigation measures. The
FAA would also issue Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) and revise the Airman’s Information
Manual advising of safe distances from the SDPP and the JCEP, as a whole. The SDPP will be
charted; no additional marking or lighting is required by the FAA as stated in the No Hazard
Determinations. As stated above, the FAA issued No Hazard Determinations in response to the
7460 Forms.

3.10.2 Operation
Air-cooled condensers to be employed at the SDPP will not create vapor plumes, but they will
create a thermal plume. The FAA currently has guidance encouraging pilots to exercise caution
when flying in the vicinity of potential sources of thermal plumes (e.g., power plants, industrial
production facilities, and other industrial operations). There are currently no regulations
concerning thermal plumes. The Applicant has further researched thermal plumes and the results
EXHIBIT U
Public Services
OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)
Page 31

of the investigation are attached as Appendix U-6. The results of the study confirm the FAA
guidance for pilots to fly upwind of possible thermal plumes in order to avoid the potential for
the high temperature thermal exhausts to cause air turbulence around the aircraft. Specifically, in
the airspace directly above the SDPP there exists the possibility of exceeding the Australian Civil
Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) thresholds such that pilots should avoid flight in the vicinity
of those plumes.

      4.0 EVIDENCE THAT ADVERSE IMPACTS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE
                                       SIGNIFICANT

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(D). Evidence that adverse impacts described in (C) are not likely to
be significant, taking into account any measures the applicant proposes to avoid, reduce or
otherwise mitigate the impacts.

4.1   EVIDENCE REGARDING ADVERSE IMPACTS

Limited in-migration is expected to occur as a result of the construction or operation of the
proposed facility. It is expected that residents from the local communities would fill some of the
estimated 45 full-time jobs. The proposed facility is not expected to result in significant long-
term population increases.

4.2   SEWAGE COLLECTION AND TREATMENT

As discussed in response to OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(C), above, during construction, sanitary
wastewaters will be collected onsite in portable toilets. These units will be privately contracted
and will not present a significant adverse impact to local wastewater treatment facilities.

During operations, an onsite wastewater treatment system will treat sanitary wastewaters prior to
its discharge to the Industrial Wastewater Pipeline (IWP). The anticipated wastewater flow
(between 2 and 3 gallons per minute) would be an insignificant addition to the IWP and would
not adversely affect the pipeline capacity. It is also expected that many permanent employees
would be hired from the local area. Therefore, the facility employees would neither measurably
increase the local population nor increase demand on local sewage collection and treatment
systems.

4.3   INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER

Industrial wastewaters will either be discharged through the Industrial Wastewater system, which
has an estimated capacity of 3.6 to 4.0 million gallons per day (gpd) (see Appendix V-1, a letter
from the Port to the JCEP) or contained in on-site tanks or truck mounted tanks and transported
to a wastewater disposal firm. The Applicant estimates that the average daily wastewater
discharge from the SDPP will be approximately 338,400 gpd, which is significantly less than the
capacity of the wastewater system. Depending on the final characterization of the wastewater’s
chemical properties these volumes will be sent off-site for treatment, storage, and or disposal.
Both the City of Coos Bay and the City of North Bend maintain approved wastewater treatment
plants that could accept this wastewater. In addition, PPV Inc., a wastewater treatment facility in
Portland, Oregon, has more than adequate capacity to accept JCEP’s anticipated wastewater. A
written confirmation statement is provided in Appendix O-5, which confirms PPV Inc.’s ability
to receive wastewater from the SDPP. Therefore no significant adverse impact to the industrial
wastewater system are anticipated.

4.4   WATER SUPPLY - PROCESS AND COOLING WATER AND DOMESTIC
      WATER SUPPLY

Water would be provided by the CBNBWB, utilizing an existing water supply system formerly
used by the closed containerboard facility. Construction uses will mainly be equipment or
system flushing, chemical cleaning, steam blows, and dust control over the 39 month
construction period. The CBNBWB previously supplied the containerboard mill and has the
capacity to provide the requested 717 gpm at a pressure of 40 pounds per square inch for the
SDPP operations (see Appendix O-1, a letter from the CBNWB).

Dry, air-cooled condenser cooling will not require a continuous supply of cooling water. Periodic
supplements may be required during maintenance. Water will be used for potable/service water,
power augmentation, the NOx emissions control (injection) system, and steam cycle makeup, as
well as occasional combustion turbine cleaning.

The CBNBWB has reported that there is excess unused water supply capacity within the
CBNBWB system and that they can install additional water lines to support the SDPP without
impacting other uses. The SDPP is not expected to adversely impact the CBNCWB water
supply system.

4.5   STORM WATER

Storm water run-off during construction and operation would be managed onsite in accordance
with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Storm water Discharge Permits
and required storm water pollution prevention plans.

Only storm water that contacts hydrocarbons (or has the potential to contact hydrocarbons) will
be routed through an oil/water separator and sent to the Port’s Industrial Wastewater Pipeline
which has the capacity to handle from 3.6 to 4 million gpd. Other storm water will be treated
onsite in the infiltration pond, vegetated swales, or through biofilters and allowed to infiltrate or
evaporate, and will not be discharged to the Port’s wastewater pipeline. No significant adverse
effects are expected during construction or operation of the facility.

4.6   SOLID WASTE

4.6.1 Construction
Construction wastes from the proposed energy facility would mainly consist of pallets, wood
packing, steel banding, steel cutoffs, cardboard packing, wood cutoffs, concrete waste, and office
refuse. Waste will be minimized and recycled to the maximum extent practicable at the site.
Therefore, without a significant permanent population and a limited construction period, the
proposed energy facility would not compromise the capacity of the solid waste handling facilities
in the area. Debris that meets the landfill disposal requirements would be transported to the Dry
Creek Landfill or other permitted landfills. Recyclable materials will be segregated and
transported to acceptable sites for recycling. Construction is not expected to have any impact on
EXHIBIT U
Public Services
OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)
Page 34

local community recycling or disposal capacities, because only about five tons of waste will be
disposed monthly.

4.6.2 Operation
Approved recyclable materials will be segregated for pick-up or transported to approved
recycling sites. Non-hazardous, non-recyclable, solid waste will be transported to the Dry Creek
Landfill site, or other suitable permitted landfills. It is estimated that 10-tons of non-hazardous
wastes will be produced per year.

The SDPP facility is expected to be either a SQG or a CESQG of hazardous waste, which will be
transported and disposed offsite at an approved hazardous waste facility. Such wastes will
represent an insignificant quantity of waste received at the permitted commercial hazardous
waste disposal facilities.

No significant adverse impacts are expected because of the small volume of waste that would be
generated as a result of the SDPP operations.

4.7   POLICE AND FIRE

The proposed SDPP would place an insignificant additional demand on local police services.
The new facility would be fenced within an industrial area with a gated entrance and would
operate 24 hours a day with personnel on site at all times, thereby minimizing opportunities for
theft and vandalism. The fact that many of the construction workers are likely to live in the area
already is expected to provide stability that would not result in a significant increase in calls for
law enforcement during the construction period.

The proposed SDPP would be constructed with hydrants, in addition to sprinkler and deluge
systems. Facility employees would be trained in emergency response and first aid procedures.
The proposed SDPP facility would provide all fire protection equipment and facilities in
accordance with the Oregon Fire Code.

The applicant will be establishing an emergency response station along the North Spit that will
be equipped to handle situations that could occur during the construction of the SDPP.
Following construction, it is unlikely that additional resources will be required that would
degrade the level of service provided in Coos Bay, North Bend or Coos County.

The construction or operation of the SDPP would not significantly impact the existing Coos Bay
or North Bend Fire Department’s abilities to provide service to the community.

4.8   EDUCATION

4.8.1 Construction
Since the anticipated duration of most construction staff is unlikely to exceed 12 months, the
workforce population is not expected to include many families. Therefore, temporary increases
in the analysis area population due to construction workers’ families living in the 39 months’
expected construction schedule are likely to be negligible. However, if trends reverse
themselves and the influx of construction workers result in some families moving to the area,
findings about the existing capacities in the area school districts illustrate that each District has
available capacity for the school children of construction workers.

4.8.2 Operation
As the proposed energy facility would only require approximately 45 full time employees, many
expected to be hired from the local community, no significant numbers of new households would
be created. Therefore, there would be no significant increase in the student population. In
addition, the Coos Bay and North Bend school districts and other districts in Coos County are
operating either within or well under capacities. Therefore, even if employees with school-age
children were hired from outside the area, this would not adversely impact the education systems
in the analysis area.

4.9   HEALTH CARE

For information regarding hospitals in the vicinity of the proposed facility, see the response to
OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(B) above. As noted, during the peak of construction, approximately
200 to 300 out-of-town workers are anticipated, with many returning home on weekends. Due to
the short duration of most construction assignments (less than 12 months), few workers are
expected to relocate their families to Coos Bay/North Bend during construction. During
operation, approximately 45 full-time positions are anticipated. Based on the above, significant
adverse impacts are not expected during construction or operation of the SDPP.

4.10 HOUSING
4.10.1 Construction
It is estimated that the average construction work force of 500 personnel would be at the SDPP
site during the 39-month construction period, with approximately 40 to 60 percent of the workers
to be hired locally, creating no housing issues for these workers. Since the average worker
would be on site for less than 12 months, it is unlikely that they would seek permanent dwelling
accommodations, but would take up many of the temporary housing opportunities within the
commuting distance of the SDPP site. In addition, the Applicant is anticipating being able to
accommodate up to 2,100 workers at the temporary housing facility in North Bend. Analysis of
the labor supply, also suggests that workers would come from the surrounding area, commuting
home to Willamette Valley areas during the weekends. By commuting home on weekends, they
would free-up places for overnight stays by tourists (Whelan, 2006; Appendix U-5).

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)
Page 37

4.10.2 Operation
The demand for permanent housing in the analysis area is not anticipated to increase
significantly because the proposed generating project would require few full-time employees. It
is expected that many of these employees would be hired from the local community.

 Both historic and recent vacancy rates were examined using US Census figures as well as those
from the Bay Area Chamber of Commerce. As shown in Table U-9, there were approximately
30,593 housing units in Coos County, with 3,977 vacancies (13 percent). The current vacancy
rate in Coos Bay and North Bend is 6 percent, which represents 707 vacancies (7,325 housing
units in Coos Bay and 4,450 in North Bend) within these two communities alone 30.

Given the substantial vacancies in housing, significant adverse impacts are not anticipated. The
local communities of Coos Bay and North Bend, as well as other areas of Coos County, would
be able to adequately provide housing for both construction and permanent workers.

4.11 TRAFFIC
A Traffic Impact Analysis was performed to identify the potential effects of the SDPP on traffic
operations and roadway facilities in the study area. The analysis focused on seven intersections
that are expected to be affected by construction traffic, with three intersections along US 101 and
four on the TransPacific Parkway (DEA, 2014; Appendix U-4). Analyses of traffic impacts
during operation of the SDPP were also considered.

The analysis evaluated both existing and future background traffic operations, including an
analysis of the peak use period in the summer month of August, when recreational traffic
conditions are expected to coincide with the peak of SDPP construction. The analysis concluded
that construction of the SDPP would have little to no operational degradation at any of the study
area intersections. In lieu of proposed operation mitigation strategies, the report proposes a
voluntary operational improvement to improve safety at the intersection of Transpacific
Parkway and US 101. The proposed mitigation would widen Transpacific Parkway to
provide dedicated left- and right-turn lanes onto US 101 with the purpose of providing
storage for turning vehicles and trucks, allowing drivers to wait for acceptable gaps along
US 101 when turning on to mainline traffic (DEA, 2014; Appendix U-4).

4.12 AIR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
4.12.1 Construction
The Project has filed Notices of Construction or Alteration required by the FAA for the
permanent structures associated with the SDPP and transmission line structures and received
Determinations of No Hazard in response from the FAA. Further, the FAA stated that no
mitigation measures such as lighting or marking are required.

4.12.2 Operation
Review of the SORA website indicates that pilots using the SORA are already advised that there
is a shipping channel within 1000 feet of the end of one runway or two-thirds of a mile of the
other runway and that vessels within the channel may have masts of 140 feet. Pilots are
required to assume that vessels could be within the channel at any time. Vessels would pose a
more substantial hazard to the SORA than the SDPP. The SDPP is unlikely to pose a significant
adverse impact to the SORA.

Within the EFSC Site Boundary for the SDPP there are no structures above the 167.1 foot
elevation that defines the protected air space around the SORA above the location of the SDPP.
There are structures associated with the Gas Conditioning Facility, Figure B-1, Sheet 2 that do
penetrate the 167.1 foot elevation. However, these structures are outside the EFSC boundary and
are not within EFSC jurisdiction. All structures have be reported to the FAA with appropriate
locations and elevations.

Although the FAA currently does not have any guidelines for conducting thermal plume
assessments, they are conducting studies to further characterize the effects of thermal plumes.
The Applicant has conducted its own study regarding thermal plumes which is attached as
Appendix U-6 Thermal Plume Study. The results indicate potential for thermal plumes to affect
airspace primarily in the area directly above the SDPP’s exhausts and that pilots should adhere to
the FAA guidance which recommends that pilots fly upwind of possible thermal plumes in order
to avoid air turbulence caused by the thermal exhaust.

                               5.0 MONITORING PROGRAMS

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(u)(E). The applicant’s proposed monitoring program, if any, for impacts
to the ability of the providers identified in (B) to provide the services listed in OAR 345-022-
0110.

As stated in the Traffic Impact Analysis, it will be the sole responsibility of the Oregon
Department of Transportation (ODOT) to monitor the transportation impacts during the
construction of the project. Because US 101 is a state highway, ODOT already monitors traffic
operations on US 101, so there is no additional burden on ODOT. 31 However, if, during the
project, significant transportation issues arise, a representative from Jordan Cove Energy Project,
L.P. shall convene to resolve the issue.

Because the traffic impact analysis concluded that construction of the SDPP would have little to
no operational degradation at any of the study area intersections, no applicant imposed
monitoring programs are proposed (DEA, 2014; Appendix U-4).




31
  There is a traffic camera on US 101 on the north end of McCullough Bridge that ODOT can pan around and see
both north and south on US 101. This camera is always on and someone is always monitoring it.

Hi Jen, 
 
 
The purpose of this email is to confirm that Dry Creek Landfill’s Department of Environmental Quality permitted capacity 
is approximately 70,000,000 tons of solid waste.  As of December 31, 2013, Dry Creek Landfill had accepted 4,487,600 
tons of solid waste, leaving a capacity of 65,512,400 tons.  The facility accepted approximately 1,100 tons per day in 
2013 (approximately 340,000 tons per year).  Therefore, DCL has well in excess of 100 years of remaining capacity.    
 
Thanks, Lee

Subject: RE: Dry Creek Landfill
 
Hello Lee, 
 
Thank you for returning my call today regarding solid waste disposal for the proposed South Dunes Power Plant (SDP), 
which is currently undergoing an application process through the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE).  As I 
mentioned, the Dry Creek Landfill was identified as a potential solid waste disposal facility and we need written 
confirmation from the Dry Creek Landfill to include in the project application.  Specifically, we need a document (email 
or short letter) stating that your facility is available for non‐hazardous solid waste and has adequate capacity to accept 
SDP hazardous waste in the quantities estimated below.      
 
SDP non‐hazardous solid wastes generated during construction activities are expected to include domestic refuse, office 
waste, packaging materials, steel cut‐offs, and construction materials consisting of waste steel, other waste metals, and 
normal miscellaneous construction debris consisting of wood, concrete, and other refuse (estimated 5 tons per month 
for ~ 36 months).  During facility operation, approximately 10 tons of refuse are expected per year, primarily consisting 
of office and maintenance waste.   
 
Thank you very much for your assistance and please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.   
 
Kind Regards, 

                                                             1

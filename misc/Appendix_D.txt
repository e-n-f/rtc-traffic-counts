1.0 Introduction
This chapter provides an overview of the study context, scope, and approach as well as the proposed Project location and
description.


1.1 Study Context
This analysis has been conducted to assess the potential transportation impacts associated with the implementation of the
Alameda Point Transfer, Clinic, and Cemetery, located at Alameda Point in Alameda, California, herein referred to as the
proposed Project. This Transportation Impact Study (TIS) has been prepared in order to support the NEPA document, the
Environmental Assessment, currently being prepared for the Project. Three NEPA alternatives, including the No Action
Alternative, were retained for detailed traffic analysis and the results are summarized in this TIS. As such, the following
transportation topics were addressed:
    ·   Traffic conditions;
    ·   Transit conditions;
    ·   Pedestrian conditions;
    ·   Bicycle conditions;
    ·   Parking conditions;
    ·   Loading conditions;
    ·   Construction conditions; and
    ·   Traffic Safety conditions.


1.2 Project Location
The proposed development site is located on the western half of the Naval Air Station (NAS) Alameda site. The NAS
Alameda base closed on April 25, 1997. The site is bordered on the eastern side by Monarch Street. The Project location and
vicinity is illustrated in Figure 1.


1.3 Project Alternatives
Currently under consideration are two build alternatives, Alternative 1 and Alternative 2, and a No Action Alternative.
Alternatives 1 and 2 would both include an outpatient clinic, a cemetery, and a conservation management office. Both
alternatives would be built in several phases; the first to be completed and operational in Year 2017, the second to be
completed and operational in 2027, the third to be completed and operational in 2037, and the remaining eight phases to be
completed in 10-year increments through 2116.

The following provides a more detailed description of each alternative:

Alternative 1 would include the transfer of 549.4-acres of land from the Navy to VA. Development of VA facilities would be
built on approximately 111 acres of the transfer parcel and would include the following components:

       ·    A 158,000-square-foot Outpatient Clinic (clinic) building, which would also house behavioral health facilities, a
            Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) outreach office, and a National Cemetery Administration (NCA) public
            information center and offices;

       ·    A NCA cemetery on 80 acres, including administrative and maintenance facilities located within the clinic building;

       ·    A 2,500-square-foot conservation management office to support management of the California Least Tern colony
            on the VA Transfer Parcel; and

       ·    On- and off-site utilities and roadways (including upgrades) necessary to serve the above-listed facilities.

The site plan for Alternative 1 is illustrated in Figure 2.

Alternative 2 would include transfer of 623.7-acres of land from the Navy to VA. Development of VA facilities would include
the same buildings as listed under Alternative 1. However, under Alternative 2, the VA Development Area would be 112.4
acres, located further north at Alameda Point and extend into an area referred to as the Northwest Territories. In addition,
the cemetery, clinic, conservation management office, and access road would have a different configuration compared to
that of Alternative 1.

The site plan for Alternative 2 is illustrated in Figure 3.

For Alternative 3 (No Action), the federal-to-federal transfer would not take place and no VA facilities would be constructed
on the site.

There are several key common components of the two build alternatives which are discussed below.

                                                                                                                  th
Shuttle: A shuttle that is owned and operated by VA would transport Veterans and staff between the 12 Street Oakland
City Center Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station and the Project site. The shuttle would operate seven days a week with
60-minute headways and a capacity of up to 24-passengers.

Phasing: The Project would be built in eleven phases for both alternatives. The details of construction and subsequent
expansion during each phase are outlined below:
Phase 1 consists of the following development activity:
       ·    Full build-out of the 158,000-square-foot clinic building and associated parking, access road and utilities
            infrastructure; and

                                                 1
       ·    Up to 25,000 columbarium niches and support facilities, including two committal service shelters, internal roads,
            assembly area, and landscaping.

Phase 2 would include construction and the operation of an additional 25,000 columbarium niches. The rest of the cemetery
area would remain undeveloped until there is a need for additional columbarium niches. Build-out of the cemetery is
anticipated to occur at the rate of 25,000 columbarium niches every 10 years through 2116.

Pedestrian Access: Pedestrian access for visitors would be provided within the Project site. There would be a sidewalk
provided on the south side of the proposed main access road located along the northern boundary of the Project site, which
would allow pedestrians to access the facilities.

There would also be pathways linking the clinic to the cemetery. Additionally, committal service shelters in the form of a
covered pavilion-like structure that would provide protection from weather during inurnment services would be provided at
the cemetery.

Vehicular Parking and Access: Vehicular access within the Project site would be provided via a proposed main access road
located along the northern boundary of the Project site and that would connect with the existing City of Alameda
intersection of Red Line Avenue / Monarch Street. There would be no parking allowed along the proposed main access road.

The Project proposes to provide 630 parking spaces adjacent to the clinic. A shuttle drop-off/pick-up area used by Veterans
and staff would be located at the curb directly in front of the entrance to the clinic. Additionally, a small parking area is
proposed adjacent to each of the three proposed committal service shelters to accommodate a funeral cortege. A funeral
cortege refers to a train of attendants, i.e., funeral procession. These parking areas would typically accommodate
approximately 30 vehicles (arranged in two rows of approximately 15 vehicles), with an open center lane for traffic
circulation. Furthermore, a small parking area with approximately 10 parking spaces is proposed adjacent to the
conservation management office.

Loading and Access: The Project would provide loading bays for individual building needs within the Project site. Delivery
vehicles would enter the site via the proposed main access road.

Bicycle Access: Bicycle access to the Project site would be available for site users, including Veterans and staff, along the
proposed main access roadway.


1.4 Study Scope and Approach
The following scenarios were evaluated to identify the potential transportation impacts of the Project:

     ·     Existing (2011) Conditions;
     ·     Phase 1 (2017) Conditions:
               o No Project (Alternative 3);
               o Plus Project (Alternative 1, Phase 1); and
               o Plus Project (Alternative 2, Phase 1).
     ·     Cumulative (2035) Conditions:
               o No Project (Alternative 3);
               o Plus Project (Alternative 1 Phase 1-11); and
               o Plus Project (Alternative 2 Phase 1-11).

The Existing (2011) Conditions was analyzed to describe the current conditions in Year 2011. The Phase 1 (2017) Conditions
was analyzed to describe conditions when the first phase of the Project would be operational. The trip generation for Phase
2 of the Project was calculated, but no quantitative analysis was conducted for this scenario. The trip generation for Phase
2 was needed because each subsequential phase would generate the same amount of Project trips. The Year 2035 was
chosen for analysis as this is the same year as the forecast year for the regional travel demand model. A conservative
analysis was completed for the Cumulative (2035) Plus Project Conditions. All the trips generated for every phase of the
Project was added to the Cumulative (2035) No Project Conditions, even though the Project would not be fully built out till

Year 2116. In addition, this approach for Cumulative Conditions was used to be consistent with other VA documents for
cemeteries.

Intersections: Existing, 2017 and 2035 peak hour traffic conditions were evaluated at the intersections that would most
likely be impacted by the Project. The study intersections are located in the Cities of Alameda and Oakland. The following
study intersections were selected for analysis with the jurisdiction indicated in parenthesis:

    9.   Willie Stargell Avenue / Main Street (City of Alameda)
    10. Atlantic Avenue / Main Street (City of Alameda)
    11. Atlantic Avenue / Webster Street (City of Alameda)

The location of these study intersections surrounding the Project are illustrated in Figure 4.

Traffic conditions at the intersections were analyzed during the weekday AM and PM peak traffic hours and the Saturday
peak traffic generation hour of the Project. The weekday AM peak period is typically between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, while the
weekday PM peak period is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. The Saturday peak traffic generation period is typically
between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM. This report focuses on the highest volume traffic hour for each intersection during the
weekday AM, weekday PM, and Saturday peak periods.

Roadway Segments: Existing, 2017 and 2035 peak hour traffic conditions were evaluated only at the regional roadway
segments that would generate trips onto the Congestion Management Program (CMP) Network or the Metropolitan
Transportation System (MTS). The CMP Network is a designated roadway system that includes all interstate highways,
state routes, and portions of the street and roadway system operated and maintained by the local jurisdictions. The MTS is
a broader designated system that includes the entire CMP Network and transit services, rail, maritime ports, airports and
transfer hubs. The entire MTS and the CMP Network are defined in the Alameda County Transportation Commission's
(ACTC) Congestion Management Program. The following roadway segments were selected for analysis:

    1.   SR 260 (Posey tube) south of I-880
    2.   SR 260 (Webster tube) south of I-880

Traffic conditions at the roadway segments were analyzed during the weekday AM and PM peak traffic. The weekday AM
peak period is typically between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, while the weekday PM peak period is typically between 4:00 and 6:00
PM. The Saturday peak traffic generation period was not analyzed because roadway volumes are typically higher on
weekdays than weekend days and therefore, more traffic impacts would occur on weekdays. This report focuses on the
highest volume traffic hour for each roadway segment during the weekday AM and PM peak periods.

Transit: Impacts to transit operations and facilities as a result of Project-generated trips were qualitatively assessed.

Pedestrians: Pedestrian conditions throughout the study area were qualitatively assessed, including the number of new
pedestrian trips that would be added to the existing pedestrian network. The adequacy of pedestrian connections to
nearby transit routes was also determined. Furthermore, potential pedestrian safety issues were identified, including
potential conflicts between vehicular traffic and pedestrian circulation. Impacts to pedestrian conditions as a result of
Project-generated activities, including Project-generated traffic, were also qualitatively assessed.

Bicycles: Bicycle conditions throughout the study area were evaluated qualitatively as they relate to the Project study area
­ including safety and right-of-way issues ­ and existing and potential new bicycle facilities were noted. Impacts to
bicycle conditions as a result of Project-generated activities, including Project-generated traffic and driveway movements,
were also qualitatively assessed.

Parking: Parking supply and occupancy for on- and off-street public parking facilities in the study area were obtained via
field observations. The Project's proposed supply of parking was evaluated against City of Alameda Municipal Code
requirements.

Loading: There are no existing loading conditions at the Project site. The Project's proposed loading spaces were evaluated
against City of Alameda Municipal Code requirements.

2.2 Traffic Conditions
This section discusses the methodology used to analyze the proposed facilities and the existing traffic operations of the
proposed facilities.
Level of Service
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative indication of the level of delay and congestion experienced by motorists. Levels of
Service are designated by the letters A through F, with A corresponding to the lowest level of congestion and F
corresponding to the highest level of congestion. The City of Alameda considers an intersection to be operating acceptably
at LOS D or better, while the City of Oakland considers an intersection to be operating acceptably at LOS E or better if it is
located in the downtown area of Oakland. The following study intersections are within the jurisdiction of the City of
Alameda and, per City of Alameda standards, are considered to operate acceptably at LOS D or better:

     ·     Webster Street / Willie Stargell Avenue;
     ·     Main Street / Willie Stargell Avenue;
     ·     Main Street / Atlantic Avenue; and
     ·     Webster Street / Atlantic Avenue.

The following study intersections are within the jurisdiction of the City of Oakland and also lie within the downtown area of
Oakland and are, therefore, considered to operate acceptably at LOS E or better:

            th
     ·     8 Street / Webster Street;
            th
     ·     7 Street / Webster Street;
            th
     ·     7 Street / Harrison Street;
            th
     ·     6 Street / Broadway;
            th
     ·     5 Street / Broadway;
            th
     ·     6 Street / Jackson Street; and
            th
     ·     5 Street / Jackson Street.


In addition, the CMP legislation requires a LOS standard of E for all CMP roadways. All study roadways are CMP roadways
and thus, the roadways are considered to operate acceptably at LOS E or better.

Different types of analyses are used for calculating LOS for intersections and roadway segments. The methodologies used
for signalized intersections and roadway segments are shown below.

Signalized Intersections
All the study intersections evaluated are signalized.

For signalized intersections, the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology is utilized to determine the capacity of
each lane group approaching the intersection. The LOS is then based on average delay (in seconds per vehicle) for the

various movements within the intersection. A combined weighted average delay and LOS are then presented for the
intersection.
Level of Service definitions for signalized intersections are included in Table 1. Since all intersections are signalized, the
LOS definitions for unsignalized intersections are not presented.

Notes:
Delay in seconds per vehicle.
For signalized intersections, average delay represents the average of all approaches.

Roadway Segments
Operations of the roadway segments were assessed using a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio methodology. For freeway
segments, a per-lane capacity of 2,000 vehicles per hour (vph) was used, consistent with ACTC's 2011 CMP document.
Level of Service definitions for roadway segments are included in Table 2.

Existing Traffic Volumes

Signalized Intersections
The existing traffic volume levels in the vicinity of the Project were determined by collecting weekday AM and PM peak
period turning movement counts (between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM and between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM) and Saturday peak trip
generation period turning movement counts (between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM) at the study intersections. The traffic
counts were collected on Wednesday, November 16, 2011 and Saturday, December 3, 2011, while area schools were in
session and under clear and dry weather conditions.

Lane geometries for each study intersection are shown in Figure 5. The existing weekday AM and PM peak hours and
Saturday peak trip generation hour of the Project intersection volumes are shown in Figure 6. Intersection turning
movement count data is provided in Appendix A.

Roadway Segments
The existing roadway segment traffic volumes were collected from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) website
operated by Caltrans. Caltrans collects historical and real-time freeway data from freeways in the State of California. This
freeway data is collected from individual detectors installed in the freeways. The historical and real-time freeway data is
loaded onto the PeMS website, which can be accessed by anyone.

The roadway segment volumes on I-880 were collected for the AM and PM peak hours during a Wednesday for the peak
month of travel in the Year 2011. In addition, the Webster/Posey tubes weekday roadway volumes were collected from the
City of Alameda Department of Public Works staff for Year 2010. The volumes for the Webster/Posey tubes were adjusted
to account for seasonal variations.

Existing Intersection LOS

Table 3 presents the summary LOS results for the study intersections under Existing Conditions. These results indicate
that all the study intersections are currently operating at an acceptable LOS D or better during the weekday AM and PM
peak hours and Saturday peak trip generation hour of the Project, as defined by the City of Alameda and City of Oakland
LOS standards.

Detailed LOS analysis and worksheets are provided in Appendix B.

Existing Roadway Segment LOS

Table 4 presents the summary LOS results for the roadway segments under Existing Conditions. These results indicate that
all the roadway segments are currently operating at an acceptable LOS D or better during the weekday AM and PM peak
hours, as defined by the CMP LOS standards.

2.3 Transit Conditions
The primary transit agency that serves the area surrounding the Project site is Alameda-Contra Costa (AC) Transit District.
AC Transit provides local and regional bus service within Alameda and Contra Costa Counties and between the East Bay and
San Francisco's Transbay Terminal. The AC Transit bus routes in the vicinity of the Project site are summarized in Table 5 by
bus line, including frequency and nearest stop.

Line 851 provides overnight service between Downtown Berkeley and Fruitvale BART. Buses operate every 60 minutes
between 12:00 AM and 4:00 AM. The nearest stop to the Project site is located approximately 3.0 miles away at Webster
Street and Atlantic Avenue.

The City of Alameda operates two free shuttles:

     ·     City of Alameda Paratransit Shuttle; and

     ·     Estuary Crossing Shuttle.

The City of Alameda Paratransit Shuttle, which serves Alameda seniors 55 years and older and individuals with disabilities,
makes runs every 60 minutes between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. A West Loop route
operates on Tuesdays, and the nearest stop to the Project site is located approximately 1.5 miles away at West Midway
Avenue and Orion Street. The Estuary Crossing Shuttle between Alameda's west end and the Lake Merritt BART Station
makes runs every weekday between the Lake Merritt BART Station and two stops near the College of Alameda every 30
minutes between 7:00 AM and 11:30 AM, and between 3:30 PM and 7:00 PM. The shuttle seats 18 passengers and can carry
13 bicycles.

Additionally, VA owns and operates two 12-passenger shuttles and one 6-passenger van. The two 12-passenger vans
currently provide shuttle service between the Oakland VA Outpatient Clinic and Martinez VA Outpatient Clinic (four trips per
day) and San Francisco VA Medical Center (two trips per day). The 6-passenger van currently provides local trips between
the Oakland VA Outpatient Clinic and Oakland VA Behavioral Health Clinic. The transportation is provided free of charge to
accommodate Veterans with scheduled appointments. Veterans must make reservations in advance to schedule shuttle
service. Once the proposed Project clinic is operational, the Oakland VA Outpatient Clinic and Oakland VA Behavioral Health
Clinic would be closed. The shuttle service would be re-routed from the Oakland clinics to the Project site and is expected
to continue between the Project site and Martinez and San Francisco.

BART provides local and regional rail service throughout the Bay Area. The Lake Merritt BART Station is the closest station
to the Project site(approximately 4.5 miles away) and can be accessed via bus or shuttle. AC Transit bus lines 11, 62, 88,
and 611 all have bus stops at the Lake Merritt Station. In addition, the City of Alameda's Estuary Crossing Shuttle also has
a stop at the Lake Merritt Station. Three BART lines serve the Lake Merritt Station (Richmond to Fremont, Daly City to
Fremont, and Daly City to Dublin Pleasanton). Service to / from the Lake Merritt Station generally operates every 15 minutes
or less during the weekday peak periods.

The Alameda / Oakland Ferry is a public transit ferry service connecting the Cities of Alameda and Oakland to San Francisco
by crossing the San Francisco Bay. The City of Alameda, which runs this public service together with the Port of Oakland,
contracts the privately run Blue & Gold Fleet to provide the service. The Alameda (Main Street) Ferry Terminal is located at

2990 Main Street, approximately 1 mile away from the Project site. Ferries run between Alameda / Oakland and San
Francisco approximately every 60 minutes between 6:00 AM and 9:00 PM on weekdays. Every ferry ticket comes with an
attached AC Transit bus transfer, allowing ferry riders free AC Transit ridership to and from the Alameda (Main Street) or
                                                                                                       4
Clay Street (Jack London Square) Ferry Terminals. An additional charge is required for AC Express buses .


2.4 Pedestrian Conditions
All major streets in the Alameda Point Area have sidewalks and all major intersections have marked crosswalks. Generally,
a low amount of pedestrian activity was observed during the weekday and weekend peak periods in the Alameda Point Area.
During the peak periods, the nearby sidewalk and crosswalk conditions were observed to be operating at free-flow
conditions with pedestrians moving at normal walking speeds and with freedom to bypass other pedestrians.

Access to the VA Transfer Parcel and VA Development Area is currently restricted, and no formal pedestrian facilities (i.e.,
improved sidewalks) currently exist on the property.


2.5 Bicycle Conditions
The Caltrans' Highway Design Manual defines three types of bikeways:

       ·   Class I bicycle facilities (bike paths) provide a completely separated right-of-way for the exclusive use of bicycles
           and pedestrians with cross flow minimized. Examples include shoreline bike paths, abandoned railroad rights-of-
           way, or within parks;

       ·   Class II bicycle facilities (bike lanes) provide a striped lane for one-way bicycle travel on a street or highway,
           adjacent to the curb lane; and

       ·   Class III bicycle facilities (bike routes) provide for shared use with pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic. Bike routes
           are typically used to provide continuity to other bicycle facilities (usually bike lanes), or to designate preferred
           routes through high demand corridors.

Within the Alameda Point Area, several bicycle facilities are provided or planned for implementation as identified in the City
of Alameda Bicycle Plan Update (November 2010). The existing bicycle facilities within the vicinity of the VA Transfer Parcel
are as follows:

       ·   Class I bicycle paths
               o Main Street (east side), between the Ralph Appezzato Memorial Parkway and Singleton Avenue;

                o      Main Street (west side), between the Main Street Ferry Terminal and north of the Lincoln Avenue / Central
                       Avenue intersection;

                o      Willie Stargell Avenue, between Mariner Square Loop and Webster Street; and

               o Constitution Way, between Marina Village Parkway and south of Atlantic Avenue.

The City of Alameda Bicycle Plan Update identifies several planned bicycle facilities within the vicinity of the VA Transfer
Parcel including:

     ·   Extension of the Ralph Appezzatto Memorial Parkway and Willie Stargell Avenue bike lanes;

     ·   Extension of the Alameda Point and Main Street Bay Trails;

     ·   Extension of the Pacific Avenue bicycle route;

                                                 rd
     ·   Addition of a Class III bicycle route on 3 Street, between Ralph Appezzato Memorial Parkway and Central Avenue;
         and

     ·   Development of bike lanes along major streets within Alameda Point.

Bicyclists are allowed to use the Estuary Crossing Shuttle, which operates every weekday between the Lake Merritt BART
stop and two stops near the College of Alameda. The shuttle runs every 30 minutes between 7:00 AM and 11:30 AM, and
3:30 PM and 7:00 PM. The shuttle seats 18 passengers and can carry 13 bicycles. All AC Transit buses have front-mounted
racks, which can accommodate two bicycles at a time. Bicycles are permitted on BART trains except as indicated on the
BART schedule during weekday commute peak hours. However, a pilot program is currently being implemented to allow
bicycles on BART all day only on Fridays. If this program is successful, bicycles will be allowed on BART everyday all day. All
ferries are equipped with racks where bicycles can be parked for the duration of the trip.

The City of Oakland Bicycle Plan Update (December 2007) identifies several existing and planned bicycle facilities. The
existing bicycle facilities within the vicinity of the VA Transfer Parcel are as follows:

     ·   Class I bicycle paths

             o    Posey Tube / Harrison Street (northbound), between 6th Street and Constitution Way; and

             o    Jack London Waterfront and Lake Merritt Trail, between The Ferry Terminal and 1st Street / Embarcadero.

Access to the VA Transfer Parcel and VA Development Area is currently limited, and no formal bicycle facilities or lanes exist
on the property.


2.6 Parking Conditions
In general, on-street parking in the Alameda Point Area consists of time-limited parallel parking. Existing on-street parking
conditions were qualitatively assessed by field observations conducted during the weekday peak periods. Based on the
field observations, it was determined that on-street parking is generally well-utilized throughout the day, although
particular occupancy percentages can vary depending on location and peak period.

Currently, there is no designated parking provided on the VA Transfer Parcel.


2.7 Loading Conditions
Currently, there are no designated loading facilities provided on the VA Transfer Parcel.


2.8 Site Access and Circulation Conditions
Currently, access to the property is restricted and the Project site is developed with runways, former aircraft maintenance
facilities, and several small bunkers formerly used for ammunition storage. Panoramic Drive, an unpaved roadway, enters
the site north of its intersection with Avenue A.

3.0 Project Travel Demand
This chapter describes the travel demand forecasting process and provides the travel demand specific to the proposed
Project.


3.1 Project Travel Demand Methodology
Travel demand refers to the new vehicle, transit, pedestrian, bicycle and other trips that would be generated by a proposed
action. The travel demand estimates were based on information contained in the 2000 U.S. Census Journey-to-Work data
                                                                       th
and the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation (8 Edition).

There are four steps in the travel demand forecasting process:

     ·   Trip generation ­ Given the land use program for a specific area, the travel demand forecasting process must
         estimate how many total trips the area will generate;

     ·   Trip distribution ­ Given the number of trips for a specific area, the travel demand forecasting process must
         estimate the origins and destinations of these trips;

     ·   Mode choice ­ Given the trip distribution, the travel demand forecasting process must estimate the number of
         trips expected on each of the available travel modes serving the area; and

     ·   Trip assignment ­ Given the distributed trips by mode, the travel demand forecasting process must predict the
         routes that people making these trips will select, resulting in traffic forecasts for specific elements of the roadway
         system and ridership forecasts for the transit services.

Since Alternative 1 and 2 would 1) both be located at the former NAS Alameda property that is currently unaccessible to the
public, 2) both include the same land use types and sizes, and 3) both affect the same study intersections, the same trip
generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and trip assignment was assumed for both alternatives.

The person-trip generation for the Project was developed for Year 2017, 2027, and 2035. Only actions that result in active
trip-generating uses were considered; accessory uses such as parking are not trip generators or attractors in and of
themselves, and are, therefore, excluded from the travel demand calculations.
Trip Generation
Trip generation relates land uses to the number of persons or vehicles entering or exiting the site. The trip generation for
the Project was based on the provided land use information using standard trip generation rates from ITE Trip Generation
(8th Edition) and information provided by VA. Trip generation estimates from the ITE Trip Generation are based on a sample
of trip generation studies at sites across the United States, for each land use provided. An average trip generation rate is
then calculated, which can be used to estimate trips generated by land use.

ITE trip generation rates are developed through the summarization of numerous surveys conducted for various land uses in
suburban areas throughout the United States. Specifically, areas were selected for trip analysis whose trip characteristics
tended to be solely by automobile. Thus, ITE rates account for vehicle-trips only. However, for this analysis, the study
examines trips made by all modes of travel. The vehicle trips generated by the Project, shown in Appendix C, were adjusted

Traffic Impact Study                                                                                    Department of Veterans Affairs




using an appropriate average vehicle occupancy rate to determine total "person trips". The national average vehicle
                                             5
occupancy rate of 1.08 passengers per vehicle was used to convert from vehicle trips to person trips.
Trip Distribution
To evaluate the traffic related effects of the Project, trips that would be generated by the Project were distributed onto the
roadway network. Trip distribution simulates the geographical pattern of travel, matching trips generated by one type of
land use (e.g. residential) with trips generated by other types of land uses (e.g., education, employment, and shopping). Trip
distribution patterns to and from the Project were estimated based upon the residence zip codes of the employees that
currently work at the existing Oakland clinic and BHC and the residence zip codes of the Veterans that currently receive
treatment at the existing Oakland clinic and BHC as provided by VA. The zip code information of employees and patients
would best represent the trip distribution patterns for the Project, because the staff and patients would now work and
receive treatment, respectively, at the Project site.
Mode Choice
The proposed action-generated person-trips were assigned to travel modes in order to determine the number of auto,
transit, BART, and "other" trips, where "other" includes motorcycle, taxi, and additional modes. Applicable data regarding
mode split for the proposed action was limited--as the proposed action consists of uses, which would attract trips,
therefore U.S. Census data regarding mode choice for home-based work trips would not be appropriate for use. Home-
based work trips are trips that have one end at home and one at work and are considered "typical" commute trips. As a
result, additional sources of mode choice data were required to derive an appropriate mode choice composition for the
proposed action.

Given the close proximity and somewhat similar development pattern within the Broadway Auto Row / Medical Center
neighborhood, it was determined that the City of Oakland would provide an adequate point of reference for the Project.
The Downtown Transportation and Parking Plan (October 2003), which provides empirical mode splits for commute trips by
employees working in various parts of the downtown area of Oakland, was consulted. The mode split for the Broadway
Auto Row / Medical Center neighborhood was also assumed to be a reasonably similar match, but further adjustments were
made to the mode split to account for Alameda Point's more auto-oriented, suburban nature and isolated location (on an
island with limited transit service and limited connectivity with the existing regional roadway network). Differences in
visitor mode choice between a general employment generator (such as an office building) and a VA clinic were also
considered.
Trip Assignment
Trips generated by the proposed action were assigned to the roadway network and study intersections from the Project
main access roadway based upon the determined trip distribution pattern.


3.2 Project Travel Demand
This section provides an estimate of the travel demand that is anticipated to be generated by the Project.
Trip Generation
The person-trip generation for the Project was developed for Year 2017, 2027, and 2035. The following presents the person-
trip generation for each forecast year.

Phase 1 (2017)
In Year 2017, the clinic and the conservation management office would be fully built-out and in operation and the first
phase of the cemetery providing space for 25,000 niches would be completed and in operation. The trip generation for the
clinic and conservation management office was based on ITE trip generation rates (ITE land use code 630 and 710), while
the trip generation of the cemetery was based on information provided by VA National Cemetery Association (NCA). The
clinic would have approximately 250 staff and also include 10,000 square feet of office space for the VBA and NCA within
the building. A 2,500-square-foot conservation management office would be constructed to support the management of the
California Least Tern colony. A cemetery is a unique land use and has unique operating characteristics and thus,
information from VA NCA was used in this analysis instead of trip generation rates from the ITE Trip Generation manual.
Vehicle trips to and from the cemetery would come from staff, visitors, deliveries, and corteges. The following information
was used to develop the trip generation for the cemetery:

     ·   Memorial or inurnment services would occur Monday through Friday between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM (based on NCA
         statistics);

     ·   Approximately six services would take place Monday through Friday with up to 15 vehicles per service and last
         approximately 15 to 30 minutes (based on NCA statistics);

     ·   There would be seven cemetery staff working in the clinic building Monday through Friday between 8:00 AM and
         5:00 PM;

     ·   One delivery would occur in the weekday AM peak hour and PM peak hour;

     ·   Visitors would amount to 40 vehicles each weekday and 60 vehicles each weekend day (based on NCA statistics);
         and

     ·   Build-out of the cemetery would occur in 10-year increments providing space for 25,000 niches (based on NCA
         projections).

The clinic, conservation management office, VBA office, and cemetery employees trip generation was converted to person
trips using the 1.08 occupancy factor. The cemetery visitors and deliveries were assumed as one person per vehicle.
According to the VA, funeral corteges average three persons per vehicle. Table 6 presents the Project person-trip
generation for Year 2017.

As can be seen in the table below, the Project would generate 2,900 person-trips during the weekday, 371 of which would
occur during the weekday AM peak hour, 370 of which would occur during the weekday PM peak hour, and 38 of which
would occur during the Saturday peak trip generation hour of the Project.

  The total number of daily person trips associated with corteges is 540 for each phase.

Phase 2 (2027)
As discussed earlier, the cemetery would be built in 10-year increments. Even though intersection operations in Year 2027
was not analyzed in this study, the cemetery Project person-trips to account for an additional 25,000 niches to meet the
projected burial needs for Phases 2 was estimated. The amount of person-trips generated by the Project for Phases 3
through 11 would be exactly the same as Phase 2. The only new Project person-trips that would be generated in Year 2027
would be from cemetery visitors and corteges. The number of staff and deliveries would remain the same as those from
Year 2017. As stated earlier, cemetery visitors were assumed as one person per vehicle and funeral corteges average three
persons per vehicle. Table 7 presents the Project person-trip generation for Year 2027.

Cumulative (2035)
The Project person-trips that would be generated in Year 2035 include the person-trips from Phase 1 and 2, discussed
above, and the person trips from Phases 3 through 11. As discussed above, the person-trips generated in Phase 2 would be
the same for each subsequential phase.

Table 8 presents the Project person-trip generation for Year 2035. As can be seen in the table below, the Project would
generate 8,700 person-trips during the weekday, 451 of which would occur during the weekday AM peak hour, 450 of which
would occur during the weekday PM peak hour, and 178 of which would occur during the Saturday peak trip generation hour
of the Project.

Notes:
SF = square feet
While the number of employees is used as the independent variable to calculate the trip generation for the clinic, the number of trips
generated are from both employees and patients.

  The weekday daily person trips are the cumulative total trips generated for all phases of the project, i.e., 11 phases. For example, the total
number of daily person trips associated with corteges is 540 for each phase. However, there are a total of 11 phases of the Project which
results in a total of 5,940 person trips (11 phases x 540 daily person trips).


Trip Distribution
The estimated approach and departure directions and traffic distribution percentages for the Project are presented in

Mode Choice
Table 10 shows the mode split for the proposed action. It was assumed that any person taking BART as their mode of
transportation to the VA Development Area would then take the VA shuttle that would operate between the VA Development
                th
Area and the 12 Street Oakland City Center BART Station.

Phase 1 (2017)
The trip generation by mode for the proposed Project for both Alternative 1 and 2 in Year 2017 is summarized in Table 11. It
should be noted that only the clinic staff and visitors, office staff, and cemetery staff were assumed to possibly take all
modes of transportation, whereas it was assumed that the mode of transportation majoritively used by cemetery corteges,
deliveries, and visitors would be the automobile.

Phase 2 (2027)
The trip generation for the weekday AM and PM peak hours and Saturday peak hour of generator by mode under 2035 plus
Project Conditions is identical to those for person-trips as presented in Table 7. The automobile would be the only mode of
transportation with an average vehicle occupancy of one person per vehicle.

4.0 Project Analysis
This chapter evaluates the effects of the Project on the surrounding roadway network.


4.1 Phase 1 (2017) Conditions
Methods and Assumptions
The 2017 No Project Condition accounts for planned and approved developments, such as the Navy Environmental
Restoration Program activities at Alameda Point, transportation network changes in the study area, as well as background
growth throughout the region in Year 2017. In addition, the Phase 1 forecast Year 2017 coincides with the planned year of
inception of service of the clinic and the first 18 acres of the cemetery providing space for 25,000 niches. The Phase 1 (2017)
No Project Condition is used as a future baseline with which to compare against 2017 Plus Project Condition, in order to
identify Phase 1 Project-related impacts. Transportation impacts under the 2017 Plus Project Condition are presented for
all three alternatives at the 11 study intersections and ten roadway segments.

Planned Growth and Background Growth
The Phase 1 (2017) No Project Condition was performed for a horizon year of 2017 in order to reflect foreseeable growth
within the area. Forecasts of future year traffic volumes were prepared utilizing the ACTC and City of Alameda travel
demand model. Existing traffic volumes were adjusted by applying growth factors to existing counts. The growth factors
were derived using base year and future year model link volumes.

Intersections
Base year and future year weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes were obtained using the ACTC and City of Alameda
model network outputs. The Saturday peak hour volumes were obtained by applying an equivalence ratio, which was
developed between the existing Saturday peak hour of generator intersection vehicle turning movement counts and the
existing weekday AM and PM peak hour intersection vehicle turning movement counts. The forecasted weekday AM and PM
peak hour intersection vehicle turning movements were first developed and then the equivalence ratio was applied to
develop the Saturday peak hour of generator intersection vehicle turning movement volumes.

The ACTC travel demand model was used to develop future forecasts for the seven study intersections located within the
City of Oakland. The existing intersection vehicle turning movement counts were taken in Year 2011 while the base year
ACTC model link volumes are for the Year 2005. In order to adjust for the difference in years, the base year model link
volumes were estimated for Year 2011 through a linear interpolation. The base year model link volumes for the Year 2011
were developed by interpolating between the base year model link volumes for the Year 2005 and the future year model link
volumes for the Year 2035. This same process was also used to develop Year 2017 model traffic volumes by interpolating
between the Year 2011 base model and Year 2035 future model link volumes. An annual growth factor for traffic was then
developed between the Year 2017 model link volumes and the Year 2011 base year model link volumes and applied to
existing intersection vehicle turning movement volumes.

Transportation Impact Study                                                                            Department of Veteran Affairs




The City of Alameda travel demand model was used to develop future forecasts for the four study intersections located
within the City of Alameda. The existing intersection vehicle turning movement counts were taken in Year 2011 while the
base year Alameda model link volumes are for the Year 2007. In order to adjust for the difference in years, the base year
model link volumes were estimated for Year 2011 through a linear interpolation. The base year model link volumes for the
Year 2011 were developed by interpolating between the base year model link volumes for the Year 2007 and the future year
model link volumes for the Year 2030. This same process was also used to develop Year 2017 model traffic volumes by
interpolating between the Year 2011 base model and Year 2030 future model link volumes. An annual growth factor for
traffic was then developed between the Year 2017 model link volumes and the Year 2011 base year model link volumes and
applied to existing intersection vehicle turning movement volumes.

Roadway Segments
The same methodology that was used to develop the traffic volumes for the study intersections was also applied to the
roadway segments. The annual growth factor that was applied to the existing roadway volumes to generate 2017 traffic
volumes was developed by only using the ACTC travel demand model. The ACTC model is a regional model while the City of
Alameda travel demand model is a local centralized model.

Transportation Network Modifications
Under 2017 Conditions, there are no changes to the roadway network from the Existing Conditions. Therefore, the future
2017 proposed Project No Action would be similar to the Existing Conditions.


2017 No Project Conditions
Intersections
The weekday AM and PM peak hour and Saturday peak trip generation hour of the proposed Project intersection traffic
volumes are shown in Figure 7.

Table 13 presents the summary LOS results for the study intersections under the Phase 1 (2017) No Project Condition. The
table indicates that all of the study intersections under the Phase 1 (2017) No Project Condition would operate at
acceptable levels as indicated by criteria for the City of Alameda and City of Oakland. Detailed LOS analysis and worksheets

2017 Plus Project (Alternative 1 Phase 1) Conditions
Traffic Impacts
Traffic volumes generated by Alternative 1 in Year 2017 were added to 2017 traffic volumes to obtain the 2017 plus Project
traffic volumes. These traffic volumes reflect the aforementioned assumptions regarding trip generation, trip distribution,
mode split, and traffic assignment for the proposed action.

Intersection
2017 plus Project (Alternative 1 Phase 1) weekday AM and PM peak hour and the Saturday peak trip generation hour of the
proposed action traffic volumes at the study intersections are graphically shown in Figure 8.

Table 15 presents the summary LOS results for the study intersections under 2017 plus Project (Alternative 1 Phase 1)
Conditions. The results show that all 11 study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable conditions, LOS D or
better, during the weekday AM peak hour, weekday PM peak hour, and Saturday peak trip generation hour of the Project.
Detailed LOS analysis and worksheets are provided in Appendix B.

Transit Impacts
As shown in Table 11, the Project was estimated to generate the following amount of person-transit trips under 2017 plus
Project (Alternative 1Phase 1) Conditions:

     ·     25 transit trips (7 AC Transit trips and 18 BART trips) during the weekday AM peak hour;

     ·     25 transit trips (7 AC Transit trips and 18 BART trips) during the weekday PM peak hour; and

     ·     2 transit trips (0 AC Transit trips and 2 BART trips) during the Saturday peak hour of generator.

AC Transit bus line 31 is the closest bus line to the VA Development Area and has a bus stop approximately one mile away
from the eastern edge of the VA Development Area. A future route alignment closer to or all the way into the VA

Development Area for bus line 31 could be possible after build-out of the clinic, but that would have to be determined and
approved by AC Transit. Assuming the existing transit service would remain unchanged with line 31 providing service with
two buses in the northbound direction and two buses in the southbound direction with approximately 30-minute headways
during the peak commute periods, the estimated number of new Project-related transit riders using the bus stop would
equate to approximately two more riders per bus during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. Headway is the scheduled
time interval between any two buses operating in the same direction on a route. It was assumed for Saturday, there would
be no new AC transit riders associated with the proposed action. These new riders could be accommodated by the current
                                                                                                                          th
available ridership capacity of the bus service in the area. In addition, the VA shuttle that would operate between the 12
Street Oakland City Center BART station and the VA Development Area would accommodate all BART riders traveling to the
VA Development Area.

Pedestrian Impacts
Pedestrian trips generated by Alternative 1 would include walk trips to and from the VA Development Area. Pedestrian
walk-ins as a mode of transportation to the VA Development Area are anticipated to be infrequent, and pedestrian volumes
are expected to be very low. Under 2017 plus Project (Alternative 1 Phase 1) Conditions, the Project would generate the
following amount of pedestrian trips:

     ·   7 walk trips (5 trips inbound to the VA Development Area and 2 trips outbound from the VA Development Area)
         during the weekday AM peak hour;

     ·   7 walk trips (3 trips inbound to the VA Development Area and 4 trips outbound from the VA Development Area)
         during the weekday PM peak hour; and

     ·   No walk trips occur during the Saturday peak hour of generator.

The new Project-related pedestrian trips generated by Alternative 1 could be accommodated on the nearby existing
Alameda Point sidewalks and the VA Development Area sidewalks and would not affect pedestrian operations along the
existing Alameda Point sidewalks and crosswalks. Given the relatively low volume of pedestrians in the vicinity of the VA
Development Area, no conflicts between Project-related traffic and pedestrians are expected to occur.

Bicycle Impacts
As presented in Table 11 Project-generated bicycle trips are expected to be infrequent. With the current bicycle and traffic
volumes on the Alameda Point streets, bicycle travel generally occurs without major impedances or safety problems. The
negligible increase in bicycle trips under Alternative 1 within the Alameda Point Area would not affect overall bicycle
circulation or operations in the area.

Parking and Loading Impacts
The assessment of parking impacts compares the proposed parking supply against the supply required by the City of
Alameda Municipal Code.

Municipal Code Requirements: Parking and loading requirements for the Project per the City of Alameda's Municipal Code
are as follows:
     ·   Office use: 2.5 spaces for each 1,000 square feet of occupied floor area;
     ·   Clinic use: 4.0 spaces for each 1,000 square feet of occupied floor area; and




39                                                                                                                     August 16, 2013
Transportation Impact Study                                                                            Department of Veteran Affairs




     ·     For greater than 12,500 square feet of gross floor area, 1.0 loading space is required.

Based on the above requirements, Alternative 1 would be required to provide 623 parking spaces (31 spaces for the office
use and 592 spaces for the clinic use), and one loading space.

Proposed Supply: Alternative 1 would provide a total of 640 parking spaces for employees, visitors and patients, and two
full-size truck bays to accommodate a typical semi-truck (approximately 55-feet in length) by the Year 2017. The total
parking supply includes 630 parking spaces adjacent to the clinic building and approximately 10 parking spaces adjacent to
the conservation management office. The Municipal Code requires a total of 623 parking spaces. The total proposed parking
supply would exceed the City of Alameda Municipal Code requirements for the Project by providing 17 more parking spaces.
Additionally, space to park approximately 30 vehicles would be provided adjacent to each of the three proposed committal
service shelters. Two committal service shelters (including 60 parking spaces) would be built by 2017.

Site Access and Circulation Impacts
Access to the proposed VA Development Area would be via Main Street, Navy Way, and West Redline Avenue. The
intersection of West Redline Avenue and Monarch Street would connect with the proposed main access roadway. The
proposed internal main access roadway traverses the northern boundary of the VA Development Area.

Other internal roadways would be constructed, which would provide access to the clinic, conservation management office,
and cemetery. These internal roadways would connect to the proposed main access roadway. In addition, a cortege
assembly area in a pre-staging area would consist of one or more lanes for vehicles to queue prior to proceeding to the
committal service shelter(s). The cemetery roadway would be developed in accordance with VA design and construction
standards and specifications for national cemeteries. The internal main access roadway would be developed in accordance
with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines.

Taxis, private vehicles and emergency vehicles would utilize the new main access and internal roadways. An additional
emergency vehicle access would be provided on the eastern perimeter of the VA transfer parcel.

Site access and circulation or emergency vehicle access to and from the VA Development Area is sufficient based on the
review of the proposed action's site plan, which was discussed above.

Construction Traffic Impacts
It is anticipated that construction activities for Phase 1 would take approximately 18 months to complete. Construction
would generally occur Monday through Friday between 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, which are within City-designated construction
hours per the City of Alameda Noise Ordinance Number 2712. Construction is not anticipated to occur on Saturdays,
Sundays, or major legal holidays.

Construction activities would include import of fill / grading / excavation and below grade concrete, above-grade structure,
paving, and painting. The paving and painting construction stages would occur concurrently with the above-grade structure
activity. Construction of Phase 1 is expected to begin in July 2015 with an approximate completion date of December 2017.
Details regarding each construction stage are included in Appendix D.

Throughout the construction period, there would be a flow of construction-related trucks into and out of the VA
Development Area. It is anticipated that construction-related trucks would traverse I-880 and the designated truck routes
within the City of Oakland and City of Alameda to access the VA Development Area. Since there a limited number of
intersections that can be traveled through in order to access the VA Development Area, it is anticipated that construction

Notes:
1
  Peak month of construction occurs in December 2015

As shown in Table 17, construction associated with Alternative 1 Phase 1 for all combined activities will generate a
maximum of 406 daily truck trips (one-way) and 92 daily POV (one-way) trips during the peak month of construction. All
construction staging areas would be located within the VA Development Area. It is anticipated that no regular travel lanes or
AC Transit bus stops would need to be closed or relocated during the construction period. Any temporary sidewalk or traffic
lane closures would be coordinated with the City in order to minimize the impacts on traffic.

Construction workers who drive to the site would generate temporary demand for parking. Parking demand generated by
construction workers' personal vehicles is expected to be accommodated by the portions of the VA Development Area that
are not under construction at any given time and that have already been developed with internal roadways or runways.
Construction-related parking demand would be short-term and temporary in nature.

Proposed action-related construction activity, including both construction truck traffic and additional vehicular traffic from
construction workers, would not substantially affect vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle circulation and would be temporary
in nature. Intersection traffic operations were analyzed with the peak month construction traffic for Alternative 1, Phase 1
added to Year 2017 background traffic, which includes truck trips generated from the Navy's Environmental Restoration
Program activities at Alameda point. Some aspects of the Environmental Restoration Program activities were assumed would
occur simultaneously with construction activities for Phase I of the Proposed Action. VA would, however, coordinate with the
Navy in order to ensure the total number of peak month daily one-way truck trips accessing Alameda Point from the
combination of construction of the Proposed Action and the Environmental Restoration activities would not exceed 935 truck
trips. This also translates into a total number of peak hour one-way truck trips of 78. The daily and peak hour truck trip

Transportation Impact Study                                                                             Department of Veteran Affairs




thresholds would not be exceeded in order to ensure acceptable operations at the study intersections. The analysis found that
all study intersections are forecasted to operate at acceptable levels as indicated by criteria for the City of Alameda and
City of Oakland during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.

Traffic Safety Impacts
The off-site utility corridor/access road would be required to be built to City of Alameda design standards, as this would be
a public street. The internal main access roadway would need to be built to the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards, as this would be a federal roadway. The internal roadways that would provide
circulation within the cemetery would be required to be built in compliance with Section 12.7 of the VA NCA Facilities Design
Guide (2010) for road widths and road minimum radius. The NCA Facilities Design Guide specifies the road widths and
minimum radius for the various types of roads (i.e. entrance road, primary road, secondary road, service roads, and
committal service shelter drives). The design of the NCA roads should accommodate anticipated traffic volume at a
maximum design speed of 24 km/h (15 mph) (NCA 2010). Traffic safety impacts would be addressed through compliance
with the City of Alameda, AASHTO, and VA NCA roadway design standards.


2017 plus Project (Alternative 2 Phase 1) Conditions
Traffic Impacts
Vehicle trips generated by Alternative 2 would be the same as Alternative 1 as summarized in Table 11. The resulting 2017
plus Project (Alternative 2 Phase 1) intersection and roadway segment traffic volumes are the same as Alternative 1 and are
illustrated in Figure 8 and Table 16, respectively. The LOS results for the study intersections and roadway segments are the
same as Alternative 1 and are summarized in Section 4.2.3. Even with the addition of the proposed action traffic, all study
intersections and roadway segments would continue to operate acceptably.

Transit Impacts
Transit trips generated by Alternative 2 would be the same as Alternative 1 and summarized in Table 11. Transit operations
under Alternative 2 would be the same as Alternative 1 and summarized in Section 4.2.3. The proposed action's addition of
transit riders could be accommodated by the current available ridership capacity of the bus service in the Alameda Point
                                                                    th
Area. In addition, the VA shuttle that would operate between the 12 Street Oakland City Center BART station and the VA
Development Area would accommodate all BART riders.

Pedestrian Impacts
Pedestrian trips generated by Alternative 2 would be the same as Alternative 1 and summarized in Table 11. The new
pedestrian trips generated by the Project could be accommodated on the nearby existing Alameda Point sidewalks and the
proposed VA Development Area sidewalks and would not affect pedestrian operations along the Alameda Point nearby
sidewalks and crosswalks.

Bicycle Impacts
Bicycle trips generated by Alternative 2 would be the same as Alternative 1 and summarized in Table 11. The proposed
action's expected negligible increase in bicycle trips within the Alameda Point Area would not affect overall bicycle
circulation or operations in the area.




4.0 Project Analysis                                                                                                              42
                                                                                            Alameda Point Transfer, Clinic, and Cemetery




Parking and Loading Impacts
The parking and loading requirements per City of Alameda Municipal Code would be the same as Alternative 1 and
discussed in Section 4.2.3. The total parking supply includes 630 parking spaces adjacent to the clinic and approximately
10 parking spaces adjacent to the conservation management office and, therefore, the Project would include 640 parking
spaces. The Municipal Code requires a total of 623 parking spaces. Therefore, the number of parking spaces provided for
the proposed action would meet and exceed the requirements contained in the Municipal Code.

Construction Impacts
Construction activities and level of intensity would be the same as Alternative 1 and discussed in Section 4.2.3. Proposed-
action-related construction activity, including both construction truck traffic and additional vehicular traffic from
construction workers, would not affect vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle circulation and would be temporary in nature.

Site Access and Circulation Impacts
Access to the proposed VA Development Area would be via Main Street, Navy Way, and West Redline Avenue. The
intersection of West Redline Avenue and Monarch Street would connect with the proposed main access roadway. The
proposed internal main access roadway traverses the northern boundary of the VA Development Area.

The internal roadways would have a slightly different location compared to Alternative 1. These internal roadways would
connect to the proposed main access roadway. Taxis, private vehicles and emergency vehicles would utilize the new main
access and internal roadways.

The clinic would be located further north and would have a different building orientation and the cemetery would be
developed within one 80-acre area west of the clinic, rather than in two separate areas on both the west and east sides of
the clinic.

Site access and circulation or emergency vehicle access to and from the VA Development Area is sufficient based on the
review of the site plan, which was discussed above.

Traffic Safety Impacts
There would be no traffic safety impacts as discussed in Section 4.2.3.
2017 plus Project (Alternative 3 Phase 1) Conditions
Traffic Impacts
Alternative 3 corresponds to the No Action alternative and therefore, the Project would not generate any trips.

Intersections

The 2017 plus Project (Alternative 3 Phase 1) Conditions intersection traffic volumes would be equivalent to the 2017
Conditions intersection traffic volumes shown in Figure 7.

Table 18 presents the summary LOS results for the study intersections under 2017 plus Project (Alternative 3 Phase 1)
Conditions. The results show that all 11 study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable conditions, LOS D or
better, during the weekday AM peak hour, weekday PM peak hour, and Saturday peak trip generation hour of the Project.
Detailed LOS analysis and worksheets are provided in Appendix B.

Roadway Segments

The 2017 plus Project (Alternative 3 Phase 1) Conditions roadway segment traffic volumes would be equivalent to the 2017
Conditions roadway segment traffic volumes shown in Table 14. As shown in Table 14, all roadway segments are projected
to operate at acceptable conditions, LOS D or better, during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.

Other Impacts
Since Alternative 3 corresponds to the No Action Alternative, Phase 1 of the Project would not result in any deficiencies
related to transit, pedestrian, bicycle, parking and loading, site access and circulation, or construction activity.



4.2 Cumulative (2035) Conditions
Methods and Assumptions
The Cumulative (2035) No Project Condition accounts for planned approved development growth, transportation network
changes in the study area, as well as background growth throughout the region in Year 2035. The Cumulative (2035)
Conditions are used as a future baseline with which to compare against Cumulative (2035) Plus Project Conditions, in order
to identify Project-related cumulative impacts. Project trips generated by every phase of the Project were added to the
Cumulative (2035) No Project Conditions. This provides for a conservative analysis because full build-out of the Project
would not occur till Year 2116. The Cumulative Transportation impacts under the Cumulative (2035) Plus Project Conditions
for all three alternatives at the 11 study intersections and ten roadway segments are presented below.

Planned Growth and Background Growth
The 2035 analysis was performed for a horizon year of 2035 in order to reflect foreseeable growth within the area. Forecasts
of future year traffic volumes were prepared utilizing the ACTC and City of Alameda travel demand model. Existing traffic
volumes were adjusted by applying growth factors to existing counts. The growth factors were derived using base year and
future year model link volumes.

Intersections
Base year and future year weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes were obtained using the ACTC and City of Alameda
model network outputs. The Saturday peak hour volumes were obtained by applying an equivalence ratio, which was
developed between the existing Saturday peak hour of generator intersection vehicle turning movement counts and the
existing weekday AM and PM peak hour intersection vehicle turning movement counts. The forecasted weekday AM and PM
peak hour intersection vehicle turning movements were first developed and then the equivalence ratio was applied to
develop the Saturday peak hour of generator intersection vehicle turning movement volumes.

The ACTC travel demand model was used to develop future forecasts for the seven study intersections located within the
City of Oakland. The intersection vehicle turning movement volumes in Year 2035 was developed through the use of growth
factors. An annual growth factor for traffic was developed between the Year 2035 model link volumes and the Year 2011
year model link volumes and applied to existing intersection vehicle turning movement volumes.

The City of Alameda travel demand model was used to develop future forecasts for the four study intersections located
within the City of Alameda. The City of Alameda traffic model forecast year is for Year 2030, but the traffic analysis is for
Year 2035. Therefore, the Year 2035 model link volumes were developed by extrapolating between the Year 2007 model link
volumes and the Year 2030 model link volumes. Once 2035 model link volumes were developed, an annual growth factor for

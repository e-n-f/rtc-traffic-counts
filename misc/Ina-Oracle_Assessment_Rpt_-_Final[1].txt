Introduction

BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

The  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection  improvement  project  is  a  Regional  Transportation  Authority 

(RTA)  funded  roadway  project.  This  alternatives  assessment  report  was  prepared  as  part  of  the 

design  process  for  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection.  Study  area  and  vicinity  maps  are  provided 

as Figures 1 and 2.  

Currently,  heavy  traffic  demand  creates  excessive  delays  and  long  queues  during  the  morning, 

midday  and  evening  peak  periods  at  this  intersection.  This  congestion  has  produced  increasing 

neighborhood  cutthrough  traffic  as  motorists  divert  onto  local  streets  to  avoid  the  intersection.  

While  current  traffic  volumes,  which  are  approaching  100,000  vpd,  clearly  indicate  the  need  for  a 

gradeseparated  intersection  as  recommended  in  the  Oracle  Road/SR  77  Corridor  Study  [1],  current 

RTA  funding  for  this  intersection  is  limited.   Therefore,  the  scope  of  this  RTA  project  is  to  implement 

interim  intersection  improvements  that  will  provide  the  most  benefit  to  existing  and  future 

intersection operations. 

The purpose of this report is to document existing intersection traffic conditions and the evaluation of 

alternatives for improving traffic flow and safety at this intersection.

Existing Conditions

LAND USE

The  area  surrounding  the  intersection  is  fully  developed,  including  residential  and  retail  commercial 

land  uses.  Casas  Adobe  Plaza  (with  retail  stores,  restaurants,  a  supermarket,  etc.)  is  located  at  the 

southwest  corner  of  the  intersection.  In  the  northwest  corner  of  the  intersection,  there  is  a  fitness 

center,  office  buildings,  a  gas  station,  and  retail  properties.  A  gas  station  and  strip  commercial  center 

are  located  on  the  northeast  corner.  In  the  southeast  corner,  there  is  the  Safeway  shopping  center, 

which  includes  several  banks.  While  redevelopment  of  several  of  these  properties,  most  notably  the 

Casa  Adobes  Plaza,  has  occurred  over  the  past  five  years,  no  new  development  in  the  area  is 

anticipated. 


ACCESS

Currently  there  are  four  median  openings  close  to  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection,  which 

provide  full  access  to  the  business  developments  within  the  surrounding  area.  The   median  opening 

at  Via  Ponte  located  approximately  600  feet  west  of  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection  provides 

full  access  to  the  Casas  Adobe  Plaza.  Full  access  to  the  Safeway  center  from  Ina  Road  is  provided  at 

the  median  opening  located  approximately  700  feet  east  of  the  intersection.  On  Oracle  Road,  the 

median  opening  at  Giaconda  Way  located  approximately  850  feet  south  of  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road 

intersection  serves  both  the  Casas  Adobe  Plaza  and  Safeway  center,  as  well  as  residential  areas.  The 

median  opening  at  Sahuaro  Vista  located  approximately  1200  feet  north  of  the  intersection  provides 

full  access  to  the  commercial  properties  on  both  sides  of  Oracle  Road.  All  other  driveways  within  the 

study area are rightin rightout only. 


SPEED LIMIT

The existing posted speed limits on the roadways within the study area are as follows:  
    ·   Ina Road ­ 45 mph 
    ·   Oracle Road ­ 45 mph 
    ·   Side Streets ­ 25 mph

ROADWAY GEOMETRY

Geometry on Ina Road meets the AASHTO requirements for a 50 mph design speed, while the design 

speed  on  Oracle  Road  is  at  least  55  mph.   The  Oracle  Road  centerline  is  on  a  14,000ft  radius  through 

the  intersection.    The  Ina  Road  centerline  has  a  6degree  angle  point  at  the  Oracle  Road  centerline.  

The  combination  of  this  angle  point  and  the  superelevation  on  Oracle  Road  creates  a  visibility 

problem  for  westbound  traffic  to  see  the  far  side  lane  lines.  During  the  evening  peak  period,  the 

setting  sun  can  significantly  exacerbate  this  problem.  Westbound  traffic  tend  to  have  to  adjust  their 

trajectory  as  they  pass  through  the  intersection.    Through  lane  widths  on  all  approaches  are  12ft.  

Leftturn lanes vary from 1112 ft in width. 


TRANSIT, PEDESTRIAN, AND BICYCLE FACILITIES

Bus  stops  are  currently  located  on  southbound  Oracle  Road  at  the  Casas  Adobes  Plaza  and  on 

westbound  Ina  Road  just  west  of  Oracle  Road.   SunTran  is  planning  for  a  northbound  stop  on  Oracle 

Road  just  north  of  Ina  Road.  Pedestrian  facilities  in  the  area  include  access  ramps  at  the  intersection 

and  limited  sidewalk,  including  short  sections  on  the  south  side  of  Ina  Road  fronting  the  Casas 

Adobes  Plaza  and  the  north  side  of  Ina  Road.   While  facilities  may  be  limited,  pedestrians  frequently 

cross  at  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection,  particularly  during  midday.    Pedestrian  counts  are 

provided in Table 1.  Striped bicycle lanes are provided in both directions on Oracle Road south of Ina 

Road and in both directions on Ina Road east of Oracle Road.

CRASH HISTORY

The  Pima  County  Department  of  Transportation  provided  crash  data  along  Ina  Road  (Ina 

Road/Oracle  Road  intersection  was  not  included)  for  the  3year  period  from  October  1,  2005  to 

September  30,  2008.  ADOT  provided  crash  data  along  Oracle  Road  (Ina  Road/Oracle  Road 

intersection  was  included)  for  the  3year  period  from  December  1,  2004  to  November  30,  2007.  The 

segment  and  intersection  crash  data  was  reviewed  and  is  summarized  in  Table  2.  The  crash  data  is 

provided in Appendix A. 

A  general  review  of  these  crash  data  suggests  the  following  safety  conditions  within  the  vicinity  of 

the Ina Road/Oracle Road intersection. 

 

      ·   At  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road,  the  crash  rate  of  1.44  is  higher  than  the  average  crash  rate  of  0.99 

          for  signalized  intersections  within  Pima  County  for  the  period  January  2005  to  December 

          2007  [2].    The  vast  majority  (75%)  of  crashes  at  this  intersection  were  rearends.  The  long 

          queues  that  routinely  occur  on  both  Oracle  Road  and  Ina  Road  during  the  morning  and 

          evening  peak  periods  and  the  high  speeds  that  vehicles  travel  on  both  roadways  likely 

          contribute  to  this  type  of  accident.   Reducing  congestion  will  likely  result  in  fewer  rear  end 

          crashes.  Considering  the  heavy  entering  traffic  volume  ­  97,600  vehicles  per  day  and  high 

          operating speeds on both roadways, the low number of turning crashes (10) and relative low 

          accident  severity  (77%  PDO  and  no  fatalities)  indicate  that  safety  is  the  primary  factor  in 

          intersection operations.   

      ·   At Ina Road/Via Ponte, the crash rate (0.49) is approximately at the average crash rate of 0.40 

          for  unsignalized  intersections  within  Pima  County  from  January  2005  to  December  2007  [1].  

          Ninetyone  percent  of  the  crashes  are  turning  crashes  and  most  of  them  were  caused  by 

          westbound  leftturning  vehicles  failing  to  yield  to  eastbound  through  vehicles.  The 

          eastbound  rightturn  lane  into  Via  Ponte  likely  contributes  to  this  situation  since  a  majority 

          of  the  rightturning  traffic  is  not  turning  at  Via  Ponte,  but  is  continuing  through  the 

          intersection  and  turning  at  either  the  next  driveway  into  Casas  Adobes  Plaza  or  at  Oracle 

          Road.

Ina Road/Oracle Road Intersection Improvements                                                     November 2009
Alternatives Assessment


  

      ·   At Ina Road/Dwy 5, the crash rate is relatively  low considering that is the main access to the 

          Safeway center from Ina Road. 

      ·   The  crash  rates  to  the  minor  driveways  to  both  the  Casas  Adobes  Plaza  (Dwy  3)  and 

          Safeway center (Dwy 6) are significantly higher than the rates at the main driveways to each 

          development  (Via  Ponte  and  Dwy  5),  even  though  each  of  these  minor  driveways  is  right

          in/rightout only compared to full access at the main driveways.   

      ·   Crash data at individual driveways on Oracle Road was not available, however the segment 

          crash  data  indicates  a  higher  than  typical  crash  rate.   The  predominance  of  readend  crashes 

          at these driveways is consistent with the trends in the vicinity of the intersection. 

      ·   Within  the  3year  analysis  period,  no  fatalities  occurred  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Ina 

          Road/Oracle  Road  intersection.  One  pedestrian  related  crash  did  occur  on  the  Ina  Road 

          segment and was DUI related. 

      ·   The  predominant  crash  types  on  road  segments  of  Ina  Road  and  Oracle  Road  are  rearends 

          and  angle.  Most  of  the  angle  crashes  were  caused  by  vehicles  pulling  out  from  driveways 

          and  failed  to  yield  to  through  vehicles.  Most  of  rearend  crashes  were  caused  by  front 

          vehicles  making  sudden  stops  or  reducing  speed.  Since  the  crashes  appear  random,  no 

          specific countermeasures are recommended.

Traffic Data
Traffic  counts  collected  on  December  3,  2008  included  weekday  midday  (11:001:00)  and  p.m.  (4:00

6:00)  peak  period  turning  movement  counts  at  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection,  Sahuaro 

Vista/Oracle  Road  intersection  and  six  site  access  points.  These  counts  included  heavy  vehicles. 

Recent  turning  movement  counts  for  the  a.m.  peak  period  (7:00  ­  9:00)  were  obtained  from  Pima 

County  Traffic  Engineering  and  daily  traffic  counts  were  obtained  from  PAG.   The  peak  hour  traffic 

volume  data  are  summarized  in  Figure  3.  Detailed  traffic  count  data  is  included  in  Appendix  B.

Traffic Operations
Existing  traffic  conditions  at  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  were  evaluated  based  on  the  results  from 

analytical  analysis  using  the  Highway  Capacity  manual  procedures  as  well  field  observations  made 

during  peak  traffic  periods.    Figure  4  summarizes  the  analysis  results.  The  operations  analysis 

worksheets are provided in Appendix C.  Current intersection operations are summarized below.

·   During  both  the  morning  and  evening  peak  periods,  overall  intersection  operations  are  at  LOS  E 

    and  F,  with  significant  congestion  on  several  approaches.    The  signal  cycle  length  during  both 

    periods often maxes out at 165 seconds.

·   During the morning peak period, southbound leftturn demand is heavy.  Queues typically fill up 

    the  300ft  dual  lanes  and  extend  an  additional  700900  ft  north  of  Sahuaro  Vista  in  the  inside 

    through  lane.   Significant  lane  changing  activity  occurs  as  southbound  through  vehicles  avoid  the 

    queue, while some leftturn traffic attempts to jump the queue.  The overall affect is a reduction in 

    through  and  leftturn  capacity.   Also  in  the  morning,  eastbound  leftturns  frequently  fill  up  and 

    extend  past  the  300ft  turn  lane  and  block  eastbound  through  traffic.    The  lagging  leftturn 

    phasing at the intersection contributes to the impact of the leftturn queues on through traffic.

    the  long  queues  to  through  traffic  is  not  as  pronounced.    Northbound  and  westbound  traffic 

    demand  during  the  evening  is  heavy.    Queuing  on  Oracle  Road  routinely  extends  several 

    thousand  feet  south  of  Ina  Road.   The  westbound  rightturn  queue  also  routinely  extends  several 

    thousand  feet  east  of  the  intersection,  at  times  reaching  the  signal  at  Westward  Look  a  halfmile 

    away.   This  rightturn  queue  typically  stores  in  the  10ft  wide  shoulder,  however  also  can  block 

    the outside through lane creating significant lane changing activity. 

·   During  the  midday,  overall  intersection  operation  is  LOS  E.   Similar  to  the  morning  period,  the 

    eastbound leftturns often block through traffic. 

·   As  noted  in  the  traffic  counts  provided  in  Figure  3,  northbound  to  southbound  Uturns  at  Ina 

    Road/Oracle  Road  are  heaviest,  with  79  counted  during  the  midday  peak  period.    The  vast 

    majority  of  these  Uturns  are  destined  for  the  Casas  Adobes  Plaza.    The  median  opening  at 

    Giaconda  Way  provides  alternate  access  for  northbound  traffic  to  this  shopping  plaza. 

    Comparatively, the southbound to northbound Uturn volume is fairly low with the highest count 

    being  18  during  the  midday  peak  hour.    These  Uturns  are  primarily  heading  to  the  strip 

    commercial  center  located  on  the  northeast  corner  of  the  intersection.    The  median  opening  at 

    Sahuaro  Vista  provides  direct  access  to  this  center  for  southbound  traffic.    Eastbound  to 

    westbound  Uturns,  which  are  heaviest  (3040  vph)  during  the  morning  and  midday,  are 

    accessing  Northern  Avenue  that  serves  the  commercial  properties  on  the  along  the  west  side  of 

    Oracle  Road.    There  is  no  other  direct  access  to  these  properties  from  Ina  Road.    There  are 

    essentially no westbound to eastbound Uturns.

Alternatives Assessment




Improvement Alternatives Assessment

APPROACH

Improvement  alternatives  were  developed  to  address  specific  capacity  and  operational  problems,  as 

well  as  overall  intersection  operation.    Several  alternatives  were  developed  by  the  Pima  County 

project team and were modified to reflect input provided by ADOT Baja Regional Traffic Engineering 

and Tucson District staff.  Five alternatives were identified. 

Alternative  1  ­  Dual  Lefts/Free  Flow  Right:    eastbound/westbound  dual  leftturn  lanes;  westbound 

freeflow  rightturn  lane  ;  a  fourth  lane  is  provided  on  the  north  leg  of  Oracle  Road  to  accommodate 

the westbound freeflow rightturn movement. 

Alternative  2A  Dual  Lefts/Dual  Rights:  eastbound/westbound  dual  leftturn  lanes;  dual  westbound 

right turn lanes. 

Alternative  2B  Dual  Lefts/Dual  Rights:  eastbound/westbound  dual  leftturn  lanes;  dual  westbound 

right  turn  lanes;  a  fourth  lane  is  provided  on  the  north  leg  of  Oracle  Road  to  accommodate  the 

westbound rightturn movement.  This alternative is illustrated in Figure 5. 

Alternative  3  Indirect  Lefts/Dual  Rights:  indirect  leftturns,  commonly  referred  to  as  Michigan  lefts, 

are  provided  for  eastbound  and  westbound  traffic.  This  alternative  is  illustrated  in  Figure  6.  New 

signalized  Uturn  intersections  would  be  located  700  feet west  of  Oracle  Road,  just  west  of  Via  Ponte, 

and  approximately  640  feet  east  of  Oracle  Road  at  the  main  Safeway  shopping  center  driveway.  

These  locations  for  the  Uturn  signals  are  consistent  with  the  Maricopa  County  Arizona  Parkway 

design  guidelines  [3],  which  recommend  660  feet  between  the  signalized  intersection  and  the  Uturn 

signal. Also included in Figure 6 are the movements and proposed signal phasing at each intersection. 

The  median  openings  would  each  be  signalized  with  a  twophase  half  signal.    Since  each  Uturn 

signal would need to operate with no more than two phases in order to be coordinated with the signal 

at  Oracle  Road,  no  exiting  leftturns  at  side  streets  or  driveways  would  be  allowed.  Westbound  left

turn  traffic  that  currently  turns  at  Oracle  Road,  would  proceed  straight  through  the  and  make  a  U

turn at the west signal, followed by an eastbound to southbound rightturn at Ina Road/Oracle Road.

Alternatives Assessment


 Eastbound leftturn traffic would make a similar maneuver. Dual westbound rightturn lanes at Ina 

Road/Oracle Road are included in this alternative. 

Alternative  4  JugHandle  Indirect  Left:  This  is  another  form  of  an  indirect  leftturn  intended  to 

remove  eastbound  and  westbound  leftturn  movements  from  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection. 

This  alternative  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.  New  traffic  signals  would  be  located  at  the  Ina  Road/Via 

Ponte intersection and the Giaconda Way/Oracle Road intersection. Westbound leftturn traffic would 

continue  through  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection  and  make  a  leftturn  at  the  Ina  Road/Via 

Ponte intersection, proceed to Oracle Road using the Via PonteGiaconda Way connection, making an 

eastbound to southbound rightturn at Giaconda Way/Oracle Road. Eastbound leftturn traffic  would 

make a rightturn at the Ina Road/Via Ponte intersection, proceed to Oracle Road using the Via Ponte

Giaconda  Way  connection,  making  an  eastbound  to  northbound  leftturn  at  Giaconda  Way/Oracle 

Road.  Dual  westbound  rightturn  lanes  at  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  are  included  in  this  alternative.  

After  consultation  with  ADOT  staff  and  since  this  alternative  would  require  full  reconstruction  of  a 

Via Ponte, a residential street, it was eliminated from consideration. 


Methodology
Assessment  of  traffic  operations  was  performed  using  a  combination  of  the  Highway  Capacity 

Manual (HCM) methodologies and the microsimulation model SimTraffic.  HCM methodologies were 

used to compare the operational benefits of the three westbound rightturn improvement alternatives, 

while SimTraffic was utilized to assess the indirect leftturn alternative.  Simulation should be used to 

analyze  areas  with  volume/capacity  ratios  at  or  greater  than  1.0  because  when  oversaturated 

conditions exist, certain performance measures of effectiveness (MOEs), particularly queue length and 

travel time, generated by the HCM methods are often understated.

TRAFFIC OPERATIONS ANALYSIS   


Dual Left-Turn Alternatives
The  traffic  operations  assessment  for  Alts  1,  2A,  and  2B  was  performed  based  on  existing  traffic 

volume  data  for  midday  and  p.m. peak  periods.  It  is  during  these  periods  that  the  westbound right

turn and eastbound leftturn volumes are heaviest and impact traffic operations to the greatest extent.   

Cycle lengths and phase splits were optimized for each alternative. Protected only eastbound and left

turn  phasing  was  used  since  these  alternatives  include  dual  leftturn  lanes.   For  the  westbound  dual 

rightturn  lane  alternatives,  a  rightturn  overlap  with  the  northbound/southbound  protected  leftturn 

phase  was  used.      The  analysis  results  are  presented  in  Table  4.      Detailed  analysis  worksheets  are 

provided in Appendix C. 

Traffic  Operations:  Adding  eastbound  and  westbound  dual  leftturn  lanes  provides  mixed  benefits.  

While  the  added  storage  capacity  will  mitigate  the  impact  of  leftturn  queues  blocking  eastbound 

through  traffic,  protected  only  leftturn  phasing  will  add  delay  to  the  eastbound  leftturn  movement.  

The  analysis  results  indicate  that  both  the  freeflow  and  dual  rightturn  options  will  significantly 

reduce  delay  and  queuing  for  the  westbound  rightturn  movement.    Overall  intersection  delay 

throughout most of the day, with the exception of the p.m. peak period, will essentially be unaffected.  

During  the  p.m.  peak,  overall  intersection  delay  could  decrease  by  some  15%  primarily  due  to  the 

reduction in delay to the heavy westbound rightturn movement.    

The  pedestrian  clearance  times  crossing  Ina  Road  will  increase  with  the  added  walking  distance, 

however,  this  will  not  significantly  increase  delay  during  the  morning  and  evening  peak  periods 

when the northbound/southbound through phase typically maxes out at 50 seconds. 

Weaving  on  Oracle  Road:   Providing  a  westbound  freeflow  rightturn  movement  will  require  that  a 

northbound  auxiliary  lane  be  provided  to  accommodate  the  weaving  between  rightturning  vehicles 

and  those  turning  into  the  two  commercial  driveways  between  Oracle  Road  and  Sahuaro  Vista.  

Weaving  during  the  p.m.  peak  period  will  be  particularly  heavy  with  some  700  westbound  right

turns and 150 vehicles entering/exiting the commercial driveways and Sahuaro Vista.  The dual right

turn lane option would not require the addition of an auxiliary lane for weaving purposes since the

            (1) The analysis method assumes a freeflow right will have no delay, however, some delay and 

            queuing will occur due to vehicles slowing to make the rightturn.

westbound rightturns would be prohibited during the northbound/southbound through and 

eastbound/westbound protected leftturn phases.  The dual rightturn lane option would minimize 

weaving conflicts. 

Access Impacts:   Adding eastbound dual leftturn lanes will require that the existing median opening 

at  Via  Ponte  be  moved  further  west.    The  current  turn  volumes  at  this  intersection  are  fairly  low, 

however  are  expected  to  increase  with  the  planned  addition  of  a  driveway  on  Via  Ponte  that  will 

provide access to  Casas Adobes Plaza.  Moving the median opening further west will replace the left

turn  with  a  Uturn/rightturn  movement.    Leftturns  onto  Ina  Road  from  Via  Ponte  would  be 

prohibited.    One  potential  solution  to  maintain  this  access  is to  realign  Via  Ponte  through  an  existing 

parking  lot  to  a  new  median  opening  some  150  feet  to  the  west  of  the  current  opening.    This 

realignment would likely require the acquisition of a residential property on Via Ponte. 

Addition  of  westbound  dual  leftturn  lanes  would  not  impact  the  existing  median  opening  at  the 

Safeway  center  main  entrance,  however  it  would  eliminate  the  existing  eastbound  Uturn  movement 

at this median opening.  Of note is that the Uturns at the Safeway center median opening are actually 

leftturners  that  bypass  turning  left  directly  onto  Oracle  Road  due  to  the  lengthy  queue  in  the 

eastbound leftturn lane. 

Adding  a  westbound  freeflow  rightturn  lane  would  significantly  impact  access  at  the  Shell  station 

driveway on Oracle Road since no gaps in rightturning traffic would be provided for vehicles exiting 

the  station.    Currently,  access  to  this  station  is  problematic,  particularly  during  the  evening  peak 

period when the westbound rightturn volume is heavy.  

RightofWay  Impacts:    Adding  eastbound  and  westbound  dual  leftturn  lanes  will  require 

additional  rightofway  on  Ina  Road  west  of  the  intersection.  Depending  upon  the  alignment  of  Ina 

Road  through  the  intersection,  with  the  intent  of  reducing  the  existing  angle  point,  additional  right

ofway will be needed from either the Casas Adobes Plaza or the fuel station on the northwest corner.  

The impacts of rightofway takes on each property will need to be assessed.   

Adding dual westbound rightturn lanes can be accomplished with minor impact on the Shell station, 

however  this  would  require  eliminating  the  existing  bicycle  lane  and  prohibiting  the  southbound  U

turn  movement.   Lack  of  either  of  these  restrictions  will  require  that  a  rightturn  island  be  provided, 


                                                                                                                  19

resulting  in  a  full  take  of  the  station.  In  discussions  with  ADOT,  maintaining  northbound  and 

southbound  Uturn  movements  on  Oracle  Road  is  considered  critical  to  providing  appropriate  access 

to  adjacent  properties.      Adding  a  freeflow  rightturn  lane  will  also  require  a  sizable  amount  of 

additional  rightofway  from  the  station.   The  presence  of  a  large  4way  power  pole  on  the  northwest 

corner  complicates  the  addition  of  the  needed  westbound  capacity  without  significantly  impacting 

the Shell station. 

Other Impacts:  Adding a northbound auxiliary lane in conjunction with westbound freeflow or dual 

rightturn  lanes  will  make  it  difficult  to  place  a  bus  stop  immediately  north  of  the  intersection.   The 

bus stop will need to be further north to avoid conflicts with the rightturn traffic.   


Indirect Left-Turns
Traffic  Operations:   Microscopic traffic simulation (SimTraffic) was used to evaluate the indirect left

turn  alternative  (Alt  3)  due  to  its  operational  complexities  and  since  the  HCM  methodologies  are 

inadequate  for  evaluating  traffic  operations  under  congested  conditions.    Note  that  this  alternative 

also  includes  adding  dual  westbound  rightturn  lanes.  Simulation  models  were  developed  for  the 

existing  morning  and  evening  peak  traffic  conditions.    Each  model  was  calibrated  against  existing 

queuing  that  was  observed  in  the  field.   The  southbound  leftturn  and  westbound  rightturn  queues 

were of particular interest. Saturation flow rates, turning speed, lane assignment, vehicle lengths, and 

driver  behavior  parameters  were  adjusted  in  the  models  to  achieve  reasonable  model  calibration  for 

the  purposes  of  this  evaluation.    The  traffic  conditions  generated  by  existing  and  indirect  leftturn 

models are summarized in Figure 8 and Tables 5 and 6.  These data represent the average of five runs 

of  each  simulation  model.   The  models  were  used  to  evaluate  existing  traffic  volumes,  as  well  as  5% 

and 10% growth scenarios.   

Currently,  the  signal  cycle  length  during  the  morning  and  evening  peak  period  typically  reaches  165 

seconds. The indirect leftturn alternative will shorten the cycle length on at Ina Road/Oracle Road by 

some  15  to  20  seconds,  since  the  eastbound/westbound  leftturn  phase  would  no  longer  be  required. 

Lost time would be reduced with the elimination of the leftturn phase. Combined with the additional 

capacity provided by dual westbound rightturn lanes, total average vehicle delay at Ina Road/Oracle 

Road and at the Uturn signals during the a.m. and p.m. peak periods is projected to decrease by 55%

and  58%,  respectively.  Traffic  operations  at  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road  intersection  would  improve 

from  Levels  of  Service  E  and  F  to  D  during  the  morning  and  evening  peak  periods.    Additional 

intersection capacity would become available to serve future traffic growth. 

The  existing  queue  lengths  projected  by  the  simulation  model  are  consistent  with  queues  that  are 

routinely  observed  during  the  morning  and  evening  peak  periods.  The  simulation  model  results 

indicate a large reduction in both the southbound leftturn (78% during morning peak period and

lengths  with  the  indirect  leftturn  alternative.    The  projected  queue  lengths  for  key  movements  are 

illustrated in Figure 9.  Of particular importance will be the eastbound and westbound Uturn queues.  

The  simulation  results  indicate  that  neither  queue  will  back  into  the  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road 

intersection.   The  heaviest  queue,  the  eastbound  Uturn  during  the  evening  peak  period,  is  projected

median  opening  is  approximately  700  feet.    The  eastbound  rightturn  queue  should  not  be 

problematic even with the added westbound Uturn volume.  The projected queue for this movement 

could reach 470 ft with the additional Uturn traffic demand with nearly 500 feet of storage available.   

Uturn  Operations:   Additional  pavement  will  be  required  to  accommodate  the  Uturn  requirements 

of large trucks.  Turning paths for a WB67 truck were evaluated using Autoturn and are presented in 

Figures 10 and 11.  At the east Uturn signal, the design will need to eliminate conflict between a WB

67  Uturn  and  westbound  leftturn  passenger  car  into  the  Safeway  center.   Since  the  Safeway  center 

loading docks are located adjacent to Giaconda Way on the west side of the center, truck traffic enters 

the  center  from  Oracle  Road,  not  Ina  Road.  Therefore,  a  passenger  car  is  considered  the  appropriate 

design vehicle for the westbound leftturn.

turn.  Leftturns onto Oracle Road from Via Ponte would be prohibited. At the east Uturn signal, left

turns exiting the Safeway center would be prohibited. 

Rightofway:    Additional  rightofway  will  be  required  at  the  Uturn  signals  impacting  an  existing 

parking  lot  at  the  west  signal  and  two  residential  properties  at  the  east  signal.    The  two  residential 

properties  would  likely  be  total  takes.    This  alternative  would  not  impact  either  the  Casas  Adobes 

Plaza  or  fuel  station  on  the  northwest  corner,  however,  the  Shell  station  on  the  northeast  corner 

would be impacted with the addition of a freeflow or dual westbound rightturn lanes.

Discussion
With  the  intent  of  implementing  improvements  that  will  benefit  existing  intersection  operations  and 

safety,  as  well  as  create  additional  capacity  in  anticipation  of  growth  in  traffic  demand,  all  without 

requiring  major  reconstruction  at  Ina  Road/Oracle  Road,  three  improvements  were  identified  and 

evaluated.    These  improvements  include  adding  westbound  rightturn  capacity,  adding  eastbound 

leftturn storage, and implementing indirect leftturns for the eastbound and westbound movements.   


WESTBOUND RIGHT-TURN

Both options to add capacity, a freeflow movement or dual rightturn lanes, will dramatically reduce 

delay  and  queuing  for  this  movement.    Although  a  freeflow  movement  will  produce  the  greatest 

capacity  benefits,  dual  rightturn  lanes  will  have  less  impact  on  pedestrian  crossing  safety  and 

southbound  Uturns,  and  will  not  create  a  weaving  situation  north  of  Oracle  Road  between 

northbound  through  and  westbound  rightturn  traffic.   Both  PCDOT  and  ADOT  concur  that  the  dual 

rightturn  with  a  northbound  auxiliary  lane  is  the  preferred  option  for  this  improvement.    Should 

additional  capacity  be  required,  the  dual  lanes  could  be  converted  to  freeflow.    Implementation  of 

this improvement will require acquisition of the Shell fuel station.   


DUAL EASTBOUND/WESTBOUND LEFT-TURNS

This improvement will primarily benefit eastbound through traffic by  mitigating the blockage caused 

by  the  leftturn  queue.  Delay  to  the  eastbound  and  westbound  leftturns  will  actually  increase, 

depending  upon  the  time  of  day,  it  the  current  permitted/protected  leftturn  phasing  is  replaced  by 

protected  only  per  ADOT  standard  practice.   Maintaining  the  permitted/protected  phasing  with  dual 

leftturn  lanes,  as  is  done  at  Oracle  Road/River  Road  should  be  considered.   Implementing  dual  left

turn lanes will require that additional rightofway be acquired on the west side from either the Casas 

Adobes Plaza or fuel station as well as the commercial properties on the north side of Ina Road east of 

the  intersection.   Adding  dual  lanes  will  impact  existing  access  at  Via  Ponte  as  the  median  opening 

will need to be moved further west.  This impact could be mitigated by realigning Via Ponte to tie into 

the relocated median opening. 




                                                                                                                 28

INDIRECT EASTBOUND/WESTBOUND LEFT-TURN

The  simulation  analysis  of  the  indirect  leftturn  alternative  indicates  that  a  significant  benefit  to 

intersection  capacity  can  be  achieved.    Overall  delay,  inclusive  of  delays  incurred  at  the  Uturn 

signals,  and  queues  will  decrease  substantially.  Additional  capacity  will  become  available  to  serve 

expected  future  traffic  growth.    The  proposed  separation  of  the  indirect  leftturn  median  openings 

with the intersection is consistent with the design guidelines recently developed by Maricopa County, 

which  recommend  600  feet.  Operationally,  the  Uturn  signals  can  be  coordinated  with  the  Ina 

Road/Oracle  Road  signal  so  that  the  Uturn  queues  do  not  back  into  the  intersection  and  the 

eastbound  and  westbound  through  and  rightturn  traffic  (with  dual  westbound  rightturn  lanes) 

operates  efficiently.   In  order  to  accommodate  the  turning  paths  of  large  trucks  additional  pavement 

will  need  to  be  provided  at  the  Uturn  signals,  requiring  rightofway  acquisition  from  a  commercial 

parking  lot  and  two  residential  properties.   Since  the  west  Uturn  median  opening  would  be  located 

west of Via Ponte, current leftturn access at Via Ponte would be eliminated.    

 

 Conclusions/Recommendations

    1. The addition of dual lanes with a northbound auxiliary lane will  provide significant benefit to 

        the westbound rightturn movement while minimizing impacts to the southbound Uturn and 

        traffic  operations  associated  with  weaving  movements  on  Oracle  Road  north  of  Ina  Road.  

        This improvement is fully supported by both PCDOT and ADOT. 

    2. Installation  of  indirect  eastbound/westbound  leftturns  will  provide  substantial  benefit  to 

        overall  intersection  capacity  and  operations,  particularly  to  northbound/southbound  through 

        and  leftturn  movements  on  Oracle  Road.  Analysis  of  this  alternative  using  microsimulation 

        shows that it is operationally feasible and should not create undesirable  impacts. As such, it is 

        recommended  for  consideration  by  PCDOT  and  ADOT.    If  the  indirect  leftturn  option  does 

        not  move  forward,  eastbound/westbound  dual  leftturn  lanes  should  be  installed.    At  a 

        minimum,  the  eastbound  leftturn  lane  should  be  extended  to  provide  additional  storage  in 

        order to mitigate the blockage to through traffic caused by the leftturn queuing.

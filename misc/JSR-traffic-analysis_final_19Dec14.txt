December 19th, 2014                                                                                      Page 2



NE JACKSON SCHOOL ROAD ROADWAY CHARACTERISTICS

Existing Roadway Geometry
NE Jackson School Road is currently a two-lane roadway (one travel lane in each direction) between
NE Grant Street and NW Evergreen Road, and is widened at several side street locations to
accommodate left-turns from NE Jackson School Road. Left-turn pockets are provided on NE Jackson
School Road in the southbound direction at NE Rogahn Street and at NE Cambrey Court, and in the
northbound direction at NW Evergreen Road, NE Estate Drive, and at NE Harewood Street. Paved
shoulders vary between one to six feet along the corridor. The pavement edge also varies between
curb and gutter or open ditch/grass swale.


Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Sidewalks are not continuous along the NE Jackson School Road corridor. Sidewalks are provided
intermittently along the west side of NE Jackson School Road north of NE Rogahn Street; while they
are present on both sides of the roadway from north of NE Rogahn Street to NE Estate Drive.
Sidewalks are generally present on both sides of the street from NE Estate Drive to NE Sunrise Lane,
with intermittent gaps on the east side of Jackson School Road. Sidewalks are generally not present
between NE Sunrise Lane and NE Grant Street. The longest continuous segment of sidewalk is along
the west side of NE Jackson School Road from NE Sunrise Lane to approximately 200 feet north of NE
Rogahn Street.

The City of Hillsboro Transportation System Plan (TSP) (Reference 1) identifies NE Jackson School
Road from NE Grant Street to NW Evergreen Road as a Pedestrian Master Plan Priority Project for
improving sidewalk connectivity.

Striped shoulders exist along NE Jackson School Road, but there are no designated bicycle facilities.

The City of Hillsboro TSP also identifies NE Jackson School Road from NE Grant Street to NW
Evergreen Road as a Bicycle Master Plan Priority Project for planned bike lanes. Bicycle lanes are also
included in the Washington County Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan (Reference 2), designating NE Jackson
School Road as a planned bicycle corridor.

December 19th, 2014                                                                                       Page 4


Posted Speeds
The posted speed on NE Jackson School Road is 35 miles per hour (MPH). During school hours and
between the flashing beacons in the school zone, the posted speed changes to 20 MPH between
approximately 220’ north of NE Rogahn Street to approximately 175’ south of NE Tipton Court. There
are no specified school hours, but the sign requires the 20 MPH speed limit ‘when flashing’.


Marked Crosswalks
Two marked crosswalks exist along the study segment of NE Jackson School Road, one at the north
leg of the NE Estate Drive intersection and the other at the north leg of the NE Harewood Street
intersection. Both intersections are stop-controlled on the minor street leg intersecting NE Jackson
School Road. The existing pedestrian crossing at NE Estate Drive is enhanced with rectangular rapid
flashing beacons (RRFB) to assist with pedestrians crossing to Jackson Elementary School located west
of the intersection.

Illumination
NE Jackson School Road has existing roadway luminaires (cobrahead fixtures) spaced approximately
250’ to 350’ along the corridor. Major and minor intersections generally have luminaires located at
the intersections. Specifically, existing cobrahead fixtures are installed on the east side of NE Jackson
School Road on utility poles north and south of the NE Estate Drive intersection, and a stand-alone
cobrahead light pole is located at the intersection in the southwest quadrant. Cobrahead light poles
are located on the northeast and northwest quadrants of the NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson
School Road intersection, with a utility pole-mounted cobrahead luminaire just north of the
intersection on the east side.

The adequacy of the existing lighting system was not evaluated, though future street lighting will be
evaluated and improved to accommodate the planned widening of the roadway.

December 19th, 2014                                                                                    Page 5


Existing Transit Service
Transit service is not provided on NE Jackson School Road. However, the #46 TriMet bus runs east-
west on NW Evergreen Road, which intersects the northern terminus of NE Jackson School Road.


Planned Roadway Improvements
The widening of NE Jackson School Road from NE Grant Street to NW Evergreen Road is identified in
the City of Hillsboro Transportation System Plan as a planned roadway improvement project.


Topography
The terrain on NE Jackson School Road is relatively flat. There are slight grade changes between NW
Evergreen Road and NE Rogahn Street and NE Harewood Street and NE Arrington Road, but
otherwise the NE Jackson School Road lies on a flat grade. NE Jackson School Road crosses a creek
formed by Glencoe Slough approximately 1100 feet south of NW Evergreen Road.


Vegetation
There is minimal vegetation encroachment onto NE Jackson School Road within the extents of the
project from NW Evergreen Road to NE Grant Road. Because of the generally straight alignment and
setback of trees from the roadway, vegetation generally does not obstruct views of vehicles traveling
along the roadway or for pedestrians waiting to cross NE Jackson School Road.


Sight Distance
The measured 85th percentile speed on NE Jackson School is 39 MPH in both directions. The posted
speed is 35 MPH. Based on the standard reference manual, AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets (Reference 3) the recommended stopping sight distance (SSD) is approximately
290 feet.

Based on the generally straight alignment and flat topography of the roadway, SSD is likely to be met
along the entire study segment. Special attention was paid to the two pedestrian crossing locations at
NE Estate Drive and NE Harewood Street, and adequate SSD was found to exist on the approaches to
both intersections.


HISTORIC CRASH DATA
The crash history of the NE Jackson School Road project corridor was reviewed in an effort to identify
potential safety issues or trends. The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) provided the five
most recent years of crash data (2009 to 2013) for the segment of NE Jackson School Road between
NW Evergreen Road and NE Grant Street, as well as the intersections of NE Estate Drive and NE
Harewood Street with NE Jackson School Road.
Kittelson & Associates, Inc.                                                                Portland, Oregon

December 19th, 2014                                                                                     Page 6


The crash data shows there were six total reported crashes in the past five years; two crashes at the
intersection of NE Estate Drive and NE Jackson School Road and four crashes at the intersection of NE
Harewood Street and NE Jackson School Road.


NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road
One crash at NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road was an Injury-A type pedestrian crash in
January 2011 involving an 11-year-old child during the 3 p.m. hour, suggesting the crash involved a
student at Jackson Elementary School. At the time, the intersection had a marked crosswalk at the
location of the crash. An RRFB was subsequently constructed at the pedestrian crossing in September
2011. The other crash at NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road was an injury crash in which the
driver on NE Estate Drive performed an eastbound left-turn and did not yield the right of way to
traffic on NE Jackson School Road. No trends were identified in the available crash data, and it is
expected that the addition of the RRFB at the marked crossing would aid in mitigating the pedestrian
type crashes.


NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School Road
Two property damage only (PDO) crashes and two injury crashes were reported at the NE Harewood
Street & NE Jackson School Road intersection. One crash was a turning movement crash where the ‘at
fault’ eastbound-left motorist collided with a southbound motorist during the 8:00 a.m. hour. As will
be shown later, the vehicle traffic a.m. peak hour is from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., meaning this crash
occurred during a time where motorists experience congestion. One other crash occurred with an ‘at
fault’ northbound-left turning vehicle during the 5:00 p.m. hour, where the p.m. peak hour traffic
volumes occurred at 4:50 p.m. Another crash occurred when the ‘at fault’ southbound-left turning
motorist collided with a northbound vehicle during the noon hour. The last crash was a rear end crash
in the eastbound direction with the ‘at fault’ driver being distracted by the passenger during the 7:00
a.m. hour. The crash trends indicate there are crashes occurring during the peak traffic hours.

The crash data provided by ODOT is provided in Attachment “A”.


EXISTING TRAFFIC DATA

Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
Traffic volumes at various locations along NE Jackson School Road were collected from recent years.
Seven day tube counts were collected from August 12th to August 18th, 2014 for the north-south
directions of NE Jackson School Road near NE Rogahn Street and NE Baldwin Street. The tube counts
included volume, vehicle classification, and speeds in each direction at both locations. Additional
historical ADT data was provided by the City of Hillsboro for some minor streets intersecting with NE
Jackson School Road. Table 1 summarizes the existing ADT and heavy vehicle percentages along NE

Turning Movement Volumes and Operations
Turning movement counts were conducted on Tuesday, September 9th, 2014 at NE Estate Drive & NE
Jackson School Road and at NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School Road. The turning movement
counts were performed between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. and between 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. to
observe the morning and evening traffic associated with the Jackson Elementary School, which is
located in the northwest quadrant of NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road. The turning
movement counts were performed during a week when school was in session. The peak traffic hours
occurred from 7:30-8:30 a.m. and 5:30-6:30 p.m. Figure 2 illustrates the peak hour turning movement
counts and associated traffic operations. Attachment “C” contains the turning movement count data.

Synchro 7 software with Highway Capacity Manual 2000 methodology was used to analyze the two-
way stop controlled intersections of NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road and NE Harewood
Street & NE Jackson School Road. These were the only two intersections capacity analysis was
performed for, since no detailed peak hour traffic turning movement volumes were available for
other intersections. As shown in Figure 2, the NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road intersection
currently operates at a level-of-service (LOS) “C”. The NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School Road
intersection currently operates at LOS “E” for the sidestreet movements, meaning there are delays
which could contribute to motorists taking smaller gaps in traffic to perform turning movements. A
site visit on September 18th, 2014 was conducted to verify these measured levels-of-service.

85th Percentile Speeds
Vehicle travel speeds were measured as part of the seven-day tube counts from August 12th to August
18th, 2014 on NE Jackson School Road near NE Rogahn Street and NE Baldwin Street. Table 2
illustrates the observed 85th percentile speeds on NE Jackson School Road. The posted speed on
Jackson School Road is 35 MPH, indicating motorists generally exceed the posted speed limit. It
should be noted that the seven-day tube counts were conducted when school was not in session;
therefore, data are not available to show whether motorists slow down to the required 20 MPH in
the school zone during school hours. Attachment “D” contains the speed data.

TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANTS
Eight hour and four hour traffic signal warrant analyses were performed at the intersections of NE
Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road and at NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School Road using
the existing traffic counts. Results indicate that a traffic signal is not warranted at either intersection.
Attachment “E” contains the traffic signal warrant worksheets.


FUTURE TRAFFIC DATA
Per the City of Hillsboro a linear growth rate of 2.5% was used to estimate future traffic volumes
based on Metro’s 2010 and 2035 travel demand model and the estimated growth in the Jackson
School Road vicinity. Future traffic volumes were developed for two purposes; 1) as an ADT input for
the pavement design based on a 40-year pavement design life, 2) to calculate the future 20-year
traffic volumes to assess appropriate pedestrian crossing treatments at the study intersections.


40-Year Design ADT
An estimate of 40-year design volumes was prepared as an input for the pavement design for the
project. The existing year 2014 tube counts along NE Jackson School Road were grown linearly at the
2.5% annual growth rate for 40 years. All vehicle classes were grown at the same rate. Because the
tube counts were performed while school was not in session, school buses were counted separately
during the turning movement counts performed in September 2014. The sum of school bus volumes
for the seven hours of turning movement data collected is expected to adequately represent the daily
volume of school buses. The school bus volumes were added to the ADT volumes after the growth

20-Year Design Peak Hour Volumes
The 2014 peak hour turning movement counts at the two study intersections were grown by 2.5% per

CROSSWALK EVALUATIONS
Crosswalk evaluations were performed at the intersections of NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School
Road and at NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School Road, which are the locations of existing
marked pedestrian crossings. The evaluations consisted of noting existing traffic operations including
pedestrian/bicycle crossings, observing yielding and crossing behavior in the field, considering
Washington County’s mid-block crossing policy (Reference 4), and conducting an empirical crossing
analysis with methodology and guidance contained in National Cooperative Highway Research
Program (NCHRP) Report 562 Improving Pedestrian Safety at Unsignalized Crossings (Reference 5).


Pedestrian Volumes
Pedestrians were counted as part of the intersection turning movement counts, and the peak hour of
pedestrian volume at both study intersections was found to be different than the peak hour of
vehicle traffic. Table 5 illustrates the pedestrian peak hours and the volume of total entering
pedestrians at that time.

As shown in Table 5, the a.m. and p.m. peak pedestrian hours generally correspond with the Jackson
Elementary School’s beginning and end of class.

To understand the crossing traffic during the peak hour, Figure 4 illustrates the volume of pedestrian
crossings at the two intersections during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours of pedestrian activity. As
shown in Figure 4, the crossing of the north leg of NE Jackson School Road at NE Estate Drive has the
highest utilization in the a.m. peak hour. Also worth noting is that the west leg crossing of NE
Harewood Street is also heavily utilized during the p.m. peak hour.

Field Observations
The project corridor was visited on the morning of September 18, 2014 to gather additional
information and observe traffic conditions. The visit was focused on the two intersections with
pedestrian crossings to observe pedestrian activity and vehicle yielding behavior.

Several school-aged children were observed walking/biking on the sidewalk toward Jackson
Elementary School during the field visit. Those coming from the neighborhoods to the northeast were
observed using the existing RRFB pedestrian crossing at NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road.
The compliance by vehicles to yield for pedestrians crossing at this location was near 100% during the
observation period. All pedestrians using the crossings were observed to use the pushbutton to
actuate the RRFB. The school zone flashing beacons located to the north of NE Estate Drive were
active during the field visit, and vehicles were observed to be traveling at a speed closer to 20 MPH
than 35 MPH. However, no measurements of actual vehicle speeds were made during the visit.

Most children on bicycles were observed cycling on the sidewalk and also cycling across the marked
crosswalk at NE Jackson School Road & NE Estate Drive. These cyclists would actuate the RRFB prior
to crossing the street and would wait until the vehicles stopped before entering the intersection.

No pedestrians were observed crossing the marked crosswalk at NE Jackson School Road & NE
Harewood Street. Vehicle queuing on the eastbound approach of the intersection was noted, with as
many as nine vehicles in the queue during the observation period. The split between vehicles turning
left and right on the eastbound approach was approximately equal.


Traffic Control and Signage
NE Jackson School Road & NE Estate Drive is a two-way stop-controlled intersection with a stop sign
on the eastbound approach. Advance school crossing signs (MUTCD S1-1) and “school xing”
pavement legend markings exist approximately 1,100 feet north and 900 feet south prior to the
crossing. Also, there are advance school flashing beacons approximately 700 feet north and 500 feet
south of the NE Jackson School Road and NE Estate Drive intersection. There are school crossings
signs (MUTCD S1-1) at the location of the high visibility continental-style crosswalk and RRFB.

NE Jackson School Road & NE Harewood Street is a two-way stop-controlled intersection with stop
signs on the eastbound and westbound approaches. A high visibility continental-style crosswalk
striping is on the north leg of the intersection and a standard striped crosswalk is located on the west
leg of the intersection. There are pedestrian crossing signs (MUTCD W11-2) at the location of the
crosswalk and there are “ped xing” pavement legend markings and advance pedestrian crossing signs
approximately 400 feet in advance of the crosswalk.

Washington County Crossing Policy
Washington County has a midblock crossing policy for assessing existing crosswalks, proposing new
crosswalks, and determining the type of appropriate crosswalk treatment. The crosswalk standards
are broken up into tiers, as indicated in Table 6.

Table 6: Washington County Mid-Block Crossing Tier System

                      Tier                          Standard                            Additional Treatments Considered
                                 Crosses a 2-lane street with or without an
                                 island/refuge                                     Refuse island, curb extensions, staggered

                                 markings

                                 Crosses a 3-lane street without island/refuge

                     Tier 3                                                        Pedestrian Actuated Signal/Beacon

                                 pedestrian actuated signal
                                 Crosses a 4-lane or greater street without an
                                                                                   Pedestrian actuated signal, pedestrian over
                     Tier 4      island/refuge
                                                                                   or undercrossing
                                 – install pedestrian actuated signal or beacon



Both study intersections fall within Tier 3 since they will cross a 3-lane street without island/refuge.
Under Tier 3, the sites are candidates for high visibility signs and markings or pedestrian actuated
signal/beacon. The treatments already in place are consistent with these recommendations of the
policy.

The Washington County policy also uses Federal Highway Administration’s recommendations for
installing pedestrian improvements at uncontrolled intersections, which is based on roadway cross-
section, vehicle ADT, and design speed. According to Table 1 of the Washington County policy, the
two study intersections currently are candidate sites for marked crosswalks, which is consistent with
the treatments currently in place. With ADT growth of 2.5% per year as outlined above, the policy
highlights a possible increase in pedestrian crash risk may occur if crosswalks are added without other
pedestrian facility enhancements. The signing, pavement marking, and RRFB enhancements already
in place are all appropriate treatments to decrease pedestrian crash risk at these locations.


NCHRP 562 Analysis
NCHRP Report 562 Improving Pedestrian Safety at Unsignalized Crossings recommends a
methodology for evaluating the appropriate levels of crosswalk protection that considers traffic
volumes, travel speeds and pedestrian crossing volumes. The NCHRP Report 562 method was applied
to the NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road and the NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School
Road intersections where pedestrian crossings already exist, in order to determine if more or less
control is appropriate for the crossings. The existing traffic conditions of peak hour vehicle traffic
volumes and peak hour pedestrian traffic volumes were considered in the evaluation. The existing
conditions NCHRP 562 worksheets used in the evaluations are included in Attachment “G”.

NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road
Evaluating the NE Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road intersection considering the existing a.m.
and p.m. peak hours of vehicle traffic and the peak hours of pedestrian crossings indicates that an
“active or enhanced” pedestrian crossing is appropriate. The existing RRFB at the crossing falls into
this category as an “active” pedestrian traffic control device. Many other possible geometric and
traffic control treatments fall into the “enhanced” category for pedestrian crossing treatments.
Attachment “H” contains a summary of all potential crossing treatments for the NE Estate Drive & NE
Jackson School Road intersection.


NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School Road
Evaluating the NE Harewood Street & NE Jackson School Road intersection with the NCHRP Report
562 methodology for the existing traffic conditions indicated “Consider raised median islands, curb
extensions, traffic calming, etc. as feasible” as an appropriate crossing treatment. Based on the
NCHRP 562 analysis no “active or enhanced” treatments are considered necessary under existing
traffic conditions. Attachment “H” contains a summary of all potential crossing treatments for the NE
Estate Drive & NE Jackson School Road intersection.


Future 20-Year Growth Sensitivity Evaluation
Per Washington County’s mid-block crossing process, it is recommended that future traffic volumes
should be estimated to test the future effectiveness of crossing treatments. The growth rate of 2.5%
was used to estimate future a.m. and p.m. peak traffic volumes at the two study intersections for a
20-year design horizon. The traffic volumes used in the evaluation are summarized in Table 4 above.
The pedestrian volumes from the peak pedestrian hour for each peak period were used for the future
year analysis. The future condition NCHRP 562 worksheets used in the evaluations are included in
Attachment “I”.

Based on 20 years of traffic growth at the NE Jackson School Road and NE Estate Drive intersection,
the NCHRP 562 evaluation indicates that a “red” signal indication is necessary to adequately serve
pedestrians in the future. This treatment would adequately serve pedestrians up to approximately 95
pedestrian crossings per hour, at which point a full signal would be warranted at the crossing. The
Washington County policy currently does not allow for pedestrian hybrid beacons, also known as
“HAWK” signals, which would be a typical option for a red signal indication at an intersection not
warranting a full traffic signal. Thus, the RRFB pedestrian crossing is still considered an effective
crossing treatment, especially considering the lower vehicle speeds due to the school zone.

Based on 20 years of traffic growth at the NE Jackson School Road and NE Harewood Street
intersection, the pedestrian crossing was found to fall under the category of “Consider raised median
islands, curb extensions, traffic calming, etc. as feasible” as an appropriate crossing treatment. This
treatment would adequately serve pedestrians up to approximately 20 pedestrian crossings per hour,
which represents significant growth of the existing pedestrian volumes crossing at the location.

CORRIDOR LEFT-TURN LANE EVALUATION
An evaluation was performed to determine the need for left-turn lanes along the study portion of NE
Jackson School Road. Although a continuous 3-lane cross-section is planned from NE Grant Street to
NW Evergreen Road, an assessment was performed to determine if opportunities exist to narrow NE
Jackson School Road to a 2-lane section where left-turns are not warranted in order to conserve right-
of-way and reduce construction costs.

The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) Analysis Procedures Manual (APM) Chapter 7
(Reference 6) contains criteria for installing left-turn lanes at unsignalized intersections. Three criteria
are available for determining the need, of which only Criterion 1 (Vehicle Volume) was applicable to
the NE Jackson School Road corridor. The data curves shown in Exhibit 7-1 of the APM were used and
are based on the left-turn volume and the total of the opposing and advancing volumes along the
roadway in the design hour. The data curve for 35 MPH shows that a left-turn lane is warranted for a
condition where the sum of opposing plus advancing traffic is greater than 750 vehicles per hour, and
the left-turn volume is greater than 10 vehicles per hour. The 750 vehicle threshold for advancing plus
opposing traffic is anticipated to be met for the entire length of NE Jackson School Road. Thus, any
side street where 10 or more left-turns are expected from NE Jackson School Road will warrant a left-
turn lane (i.e. center two-way left-turn lane).

For side streets where peak hour turning movement volume data was not available, the approximate
number of homes the street serves was recorded and an approximation of peak hour traffic turning
onto the street from NE Jackson School Road was calculated. The turning traffic was approximated
using the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Reference 7) rates for Single Family Detached housing (ITE
Code 210). Table 7 summarizes the results of the left-turn warrant analysis.

As shown in Table 7, the first public side street north of NE Grant Street not warranting a left-turn
lane from Jackson School Road is NE Tipton Court. NE Tipton Court is located approximately 400 feet
south of NE Estate Drive and falls within the existing taper for the northbound left-turn lane at NE
Estate Drive. Further, the driveways into the LDS Church just south of NE Tipton Court would benefit
from a two-way left-turn lane for peak periods of church traffic.

NE Cambrey Court does not warrant a left-turn lane from NE Jackson School Road, although it falls
within the existing widened cross-section accommodating the northbound left-turn at NE Estate
Drive. Thus, the left-turn into NE Cambrey Court can be accommodated with the center two-way left-
turn lane.

Several private drives exist north of NE Rogahn Street, each serving between 6 and 13 residences.
Based on trip generation estimates for traffic generated by the residences, left-turn lanes are not
warranted at any of the private drives. Additionally, NE Sundance Court does not warrant a left-turn
lane. This segment of NE Jackson School Road between NE Rogahn Street and NW Evergreen Road
presents a potential area where a two-lane cross-section could be maintained. The crossing of the
Glencoe Slough creek falls within this segment. However, approximately 15 private driveways serving

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Existing Traffic conditions
                The existing 2014 ADT along NE Jackson School Road was measured to be approximately
                 7,200 vehicles per day. See Table 1 above.
                The existing 85th percentile speeds measured along NE Jackson School Road were found to
                 be an average of 39 MPH, which exceeds the posted speed of 35 MPH. See Table 2 above.
                A total of 6 crashes were reported along NE Jackson School Road in the past 5 years, all
                 occurring at the NE Estate Drive and the NE Harewood Street intersections. No crash
                 trends were identified.

                Existing traffic operations at the NE Estate Drive/NE Jackson School Road intersection
                 were found to be LOS “C” during both the AM and PM peak periods.
                Existing traffic operations at the NE Harewood Street/NE Jackson School Road intersection
                 were found to be LOS “D” for the AM peak and LOS “E” for the PM peak period.
                       o A three-lane cross section on NE Harewood Street would improve the traffic
                         operations.
                Traffic signals are not currently warranted at either the NE Estate Drive/NE Jackson School
                 Road or the NE Harewood Street/NE Jackson School Road intersection.


Future Traffic Conditions
                The 40-year design ADT is anticipated to be approximately 14,460 vehicles per day. See
                 Table 3 above and Attachment “F”.
                The 20-year design turning movement volumes at the two study intersections are shown
                 in Table 4 and Figure 3 above.


Crosswalk Evaluations
The following summarizes the pedestrian crossing evaluations conducted at the two intersections
with existing pedestrian crossings.


NE Jackson School Road and NE Estate Drive
                Existing two-way stop-controlled intersection with a stop sign on the eastbound approach.
                 Single lane in each direction on all approaches, with separate northbound left-turn lane.

Jackson School Road Enhancement Project                                                           Project #: 17798.0
December 19th, 2014                                                                                          Page 20


                Existing advance school crossing signs (MUTCD S1-1) and “school xing” pavement legend
                 markings approximately 1,100 feet north and 900 feet south prior to the crossing.
                Existing advance school flashing beacons approximately 700 feet north and 500 feet south
                 of the intersection. There are school crossings signs (MUTCD S1-1) at the location of the
                 high visibility continental-style crosswalk and RRFB.
                Existing pedestrian counts:
                       o 78 pedestrian crossings in AM peak hour
                       o 56 pedestrian crossings in PM peak hour
                Pedestrians were observed activating the RRFB before crossing, and vehicle yielding rate
                 was near 100% during observation period.
                Washington County Mid-Block Crossing Policy – Tier 3 crossing type
                       o Candidate for high visibility signs and markings or pedestrian actuated
                         signal/beacon.
                NCHRP Report 562 analysis:
                       o Existing conditions: “active or enhanced” treatment warranted.
                       o Future 20-year traffic conditions: “red” signal indication warranted.
                       o “red” signal indication treatment would serve up to approximately 95 pedestrian
                         crossings per hour before a full signal is warranted at the crossing.
                       o RRFB pedestrian crossing is still considered an effective crossing treatment for the
                         future condition, especially considering the lower vehicle speeds due to the school
                         zone.
                Recommended pedestrian crossing treatments:
                       o Maintain RRFB pedestrian crossing with continental-style crosswalk on north leg of
                         intersection.
                       o Maintain 20 MPH school zone with flashers in advance of school.
                       o Maintain advance signing and pavement legends. Re-evaluate exact placement
                         with the project design and based on current version of the MUTCD.
                       o Improve intersection lighting to current Washington County standards to increase
                         visibility at the pedestrian crossing.
                       o Consider a median refuge island on the north leg of NE Jackson School Road and
                         NE Estate Drive.

                       o Consider speed feedback signs on NE Jackson School Road in conjunction with the
                         school zone speed limit.

                       o See Attachment “H” for additional possible “active or enhanced” pedestrian
                         crossing treatments.


NE Jackson School Road and NE Harewood Street
                Existing two-way stop-controlled intersection with stop signs on the eastbound and
                 westbound approaches. Single lane in each direction on all approaches, with separate
                 northbound left-turn lane.
                Existing high visibility continental-style crosswalk striping on the north leg of the
                 intersection and a standard striped crosswalk on the west leg of the intersection.
                Existing pedestrian crossing signs (MUTCD W11-2) at the location of the crosswalk and
                 “ped xing” pavement legend markings and pedestrian crossing signs approximately 400
                 feet in advance of the crosswalk.
                Existing pedestrian counts:
                       o 12 pedestrian crossings in AM peak hour
                       o 31 pedestrian crossings in PM peak hour
                No pedestrians were observed crossing during the field observation period.
                Washington County Mid-Block Crossing Policy – Tier 3 crossing type
                       o Candidate for high visibility signs and markings or pedestrian actuated
                         signal/beacon.
                NCHRP Report 562 analysis:
                       o Existing conditions: “consider raised median islands, curb extensions, traffic
                         calming, etc. as feasible” treatment warranted.
                       o Future 20-year traffic conditions: “consider raised median islands, curb extensions,
                         traffic calming, etc. as feasible” treatment warranted.
                       o Identified treatment would serve up to approximately 20 pedestrian crossings per
                         hour before “active or enhanced” treatments are warranted.
                Recommended pedestrian crossing treatments:
                       o Maintain existing striped continental-style crosswalk on north leg of intersection.
                       o Maintain existing advance signing and pavement legends. Re-evaluate exact
                         placement with the project design and based on current version of the MUTCD.
                       o Improve intersection lighting to current Washington County standards to increase

December 19th, 2014                                                                                         Page 22


                       o Consider placing pedestrian crossing signs (MUTCD W11-2) on both sides of the
                         crossing for each approaching direction to increase the visibility of the crossing.

                       o See Attachment “H” for additional possible “active or enhanced” pedestrian
                         crossing treatments.


Corridor Left-Turn Lane Evaluation
                Left-turn lanes were evaluated for each side street along NE Jackson School Road using
                 the methodology in Chapter 7 of the ODOT APM.
                Left-turns are warranted for all side streets from NE Grant Street to NE Rogahn Street,
                 except for NE Tipton Court and NE Cambrey Court. The two streets not warranting left-
                 turn lanes fall within the taper area of upstream or downstream intersections warranting
                 left-turns.
                No side streets or private drives between NE Rogahn Street and NW Evergreen Road
                 warrant left-turn lanes. A two-lane cross-section on NE Jackson School Road could be
                 considered for this segment.

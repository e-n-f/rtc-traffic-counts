ANALYSIS OF 10-ACRE SITE PLAN TRANSPORTATION IMPACTS
This report summarizes the anticipated transportation impacts associated with the development of the
10-acre site for Oregon State University (OSU) Cascades. The site is located within Century Washington
Center (Lot 19), which is located at 1500 SW Chandler Ave in Bend.

This property was previously studied for commercial development as part of the overall Century
Washington Center. The existing zoning enables development of the OSU-Cascades as a permitted use.
The University’s proposed development will accommodate student enrollment up to 1,890 students at
maximum capacity. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the tax lot to be developed.

The key findings of the transportation impact analysis relate to impacted intersections and roadways
and multimodal connectivity needs. This information can be used to support the Site plan and design
review application.

As documented within this report, the key transportation requirement to support the 10-acre campus
development is to fully connect and integrate the campus and nearby multimodal transportation
system. The University and the surrounding community will benefit from the multimodal transportation
infrastructure improvements already identified in other City plans that will improve the connectivity
and travel options for the campus and the overall neighborhood.

The body of this report includes discussion of the key findings; further details on the methodology and
the technical analyses are included in the report appendices. This report and appendices provide the
information required to comply with City of Bend Transportation Impact Analysis requirements as
documented within Section 4.7 of the City’s Development Code.

EXISTING TRANSPORTATION CONDITIONS
The southwest quadrant of Bend is characterized by a mixture of commercial, residential and school-
related uses. The southwest neighborhoods within Bend are supported generally by key arterials and
collectors, including Century Drive, Mount Washington Drive, Reed Market Road and Colorado Avenue,
as shown in Exhibit 1. These streets provide access into southwest Bend for all modes of travel as well
as for regional travel associated with the recreational uses outside of the City’s urban growth boundary.
As such, the travel patterns within this area are influenced by summer and winter recreational
activities, weekday morning and afternoon school traffic and the day-to-day travel needs of the
neighborhood’s residents, employees, and customers.


Adjacent Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
The existing streets that will serve OSU-Cascades include SW Chandler Avenue along the southern
boundary, SW Century Drive to the east, and Mt. Washington Drive to the west. There are sidewalks on
the roadways abutting the site, and bicycle lanes on both Century Drive and Mt. Washington Drive.
Colorado Avenue and Reed Market Road also provide both pedestrian and bicycle connections
throughout their length, connecting the campus east to the downtown, Old Mill District, parks, and
recreation areas. Chandler Avenue is currently an unstriped roadway allowing on-street parking on both
sides of the street.

The OSU-Cascades site has been situated to provide convenient access to supporting retail services.
Today, sidewalks are provided along the 14th Street/Century Drive corridor. In addition, the Deschutes
River trail provides for robust pedestrian and cyclist access between the campus and the overall city of
Bend. Connections to the Deschutes River Trail are available from Reed Market Road and Columbia
Street.

There are gaps in the pedestrian system along the west side of Century Drive north of the site along
privately owned property and along the east side of Mt. Washington Drive. The City’s “GO Bond”
funding may help to address 14th Street streetscape elements north of Simpson Avenue. At this point,
the specific scope and extent of the GO Bond project is not yet defined and is subject to available
funding.


Existing Transit Services
Cascades East Transit (CET) provides fixed route transit service in Bend. An illustration of Route 11 –
Galveston is provided below in Figure 2. This route provides direct access to the site, with
approximately 40 minute headways and operates on weekdays. Fares are $1.50 each way, and a day
pass is $2.50. CET buses include a bicycle rack.

Currently, the transit stop nearest the campus is located on Century Drive just south of Colorado
Avenue. The stop includes a bus pull-out and a concrete pad, but no other transit amenities for waiting
patrons.

Intersection Operations
Per the City of Bend development code and scoping direction, the traffic impact analysis needs to
address traffic operations at affected collector and arterial intersections within one-mile driving
distance from the 10-acre site. The City’s development code (Bend Development Code 4.7) specifies the
appropriate impact area of study. All analyses presented in this report comply with that standard.

Operationally, all of the study intersections that surround the OSU-Cascades site operate within City
standards today. There are relatively low delays on the system, but left-turns at stop-signs that enter
major roadway facilities can experience longer delays during the peaks. Additionally, drivers may
experience higher delays along Mt. Washington Drive during short durations of the weekday morning
and afternoon school peak hours (approximately 2:50 to 3:10 p.m.) associated with parent drop
off/pick up activities at the nearby schools. Further discussion of this peaking is provided in Appendix
“C”.

City analysis requirements are based on the overall peak hour (single hour when the most total entering
vehicles are on the system) between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. The City’s long-range transportation
planning efforts, forecasting models, transportation system development charges, and the vast majority

of available data (such as trip generation) is available for this critical commute time period. Typically,
traffic counts are collected between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., with the single peak hour within this time
period assessed within the analysis models. Within this analysis for OSU-Cascades we collected the
count data with 24-hour tube counts, and reviewed this information to compile the turning movement
counts for the peak hour during the 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. evening commute period. This allows us to meet
City analysis requirements while providing an understanding of traffic flows during other time periods
throughout the day.


INTERSECTION AND ROADWAY SAFETY
Year 2007 through 2012 crash records were obtained from the Oregon Department of Transportation
(ODOT) for each of the study area intersections. The crash database contains crashes that are required
to be reported (those that involve personal injury or property damage in excess of $1,500) as well as
reports provided by local responders. This information was reviewed to identify patterns and trends
within the data that could be indicators for operational or geometric improvement needs. The following
safety-related issues were identified on the surrounding system:


Regional Crash Trends
Regional crash trends were prepared as the aggregation of all of the reported crashes at the study area
intersections. This information was reviewed to identify overall safety issues throughout the area.

         Annual crashes throughout the area have generally increased from 2008 to 2012.
         Most crashes occur between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. (65%), and angle and rear-end collisions
          are the most common crash types.
         Approximately 30% of reported crashes result in some level of injury.
         Nearly 80% of the crashes occur on dry roads in clear or cloudy conditions during daylight hours.
         Of the 89 total reported intersection crashes only a single collision was attributed to drug use;
          alcohol was not cited as a factor in any crashes.


Intersection Specific Trends:
The following are findings based on our review of the available crash records at the individual study
intersections.

         The roundabout at the Galveston and 14th Street intersection had 17 reported crashes, with
          most crashes categorized as rear-end collisions and nearly 40% resulting in some level of injury.
          Following too closely was cited as the primary crash cause in over 75% of the crashes. All
          reported crashes occurred during the day, and only one crash was related to weather
          conditions. The reported crashes at this intersection include crashes associated with closely-
          spaced business driveways. One crash involved a cyclist, and a second crash was caused by a
          motorist response to a pedestrian crossing (the pedestrian was not involved in the crash).


                                                        6                               Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

         The Colorado Avenue/Columbia Street intersection had 9 reported crashes, and exhibits a
          decreasing annual crash trend. Only a single “possible injury” was reported. Most of the crashes
          were classified as angle collisions, which is typical of two-way stop-controlled intersections. No
          crash trends were noted based on review of the available information.
         The Mt. Washington Drive/Simpson Avenue intersection showed a marked decrease in crashes
          following interim intersection improvements by the City, with no reported crashes in 2011 and
          only a single crash in 2012. The intersection was recently reconstructed as a roundabout.

Based on review of the crash data, it is recommended that the City continue to monitor crashes at the
14th Street/Galveston roundabout and consider how access consolidation or relocation can occur
(particularly on the exit legs) as adjacent properties redevelop.


FUTURE TRANSPORTATION CONDITIONS
The buildings on the 10-acre site have been designed to accommodate student growth up to 1,890
students (based on total headcount). To support this vision, we approximated the off-site
transportation impacts associated with the student enrollment projections. Per City of Bend standards,
this analysis was prepared to address year of opening (2015) and five-years beyond build-out (2020)
conditions, both scenarios assume maximum student capacity of the buildings although this level is not
expected to be reached until approximately 2017. These analyses were prepared to understand near-
term needs and to assist the City with the planning of capital improvements.


Pathways and Connections
The campus layout shown in Figure 3 was designed to reduce internal conflicts between automobile
traffic, pedestrians, and cyclists. A perimeter roadway will contain vehicles on the exterior of the
campus, with strong pedestrian pathway connections linking the buildings together. Students can walk
between all of the buildings without crossing a drive aisle. Pathways provide the most direct routes
available to connect students with the adjacent public sidewalks, bicycle facilities, and transit systems.
A strong pedestrian connection was built to connect to the Chandler Avenue roundabout and to the
northeast corner of the site. Additionally, bicycle racks are prominently located in front of the
residential and academic buildings and a student drop-off/transit stop is situated directly in front of the
academic building.

The site plan proposes a main entrance to the campus at a new intersection on Chandler Avenue. This
new entrance is located on the apex of the curve and to the west of Yates Drive, as shown in Figure 3.
The main entrance will provide access to the lowest-order roadway abutting the site and will provide
vehicles with access onto Century Drive at the existing roundabout.

A separate access to the college is proposed onto Century Drive in the northeast corner of the site,
directly offset from Donovan Avenue. This access will serve fire, construction, and service vehicle
access, and provide a secondary access to the campus parking area. The access is designed to support

full access movements. This access has intentionally been designed with a single-shared outbound lane
for the following reasons:

         While providing convenient access to the 10-acre parcel, use of the Chandler Avenue
          roundabout provides safer movements onto the higher-order public street system.
         Omitting a separate outbound (eastbound) left-turn lane shortens the pedestrian crossing
          distance along Century Drive and increases the visibility of approaching bicycles and pedestrians
          that could otherwise be occluded by adjacent motorists.
         The design tradeoff made between vehicular capacity and pedestrian capacity will encourage
          short-length trips to occur by modes other than automobile.
         During the peak traffic periods on Century Drive the Chandler Avenue roundabout will provide
          more comfortable maneuvers (particularly for motorists destined to the north) and lower delays
          than the Century Drive access.

Accordingly, while the Century Drive access provides a convenient ingress for the 10-acre site
development, the reduced capacity provided by the design will limit this access to serve as a secondary
entrance. Based on discussions with City staff, it is recommended that design treatments at this
connection maintain a level sidewalk crossing and avoid corner radii commonly constructed on local
streets. While intended to meet the City’s block spacing and perimeter policies, this design will continue
to provide the desired connectivity while reducing its emphasis and further prioritizing pedestrian
crossings.

A critical component of this access is the ability to accommodate the pedestrian crossing needs from
the northeast corner of the site to the sidewalks along the east side of Century Drive. As shown in the
site layout, the pathway network provides direct connections to this corner to facilitate this movement
through the campus, and student housing has been specifically located to reduce travel distances to the
nearby retail. A pedestrian crossing of Century Drive is proposed at Donovan to tie the campus to the
sidewalk system on the east side of Century Drive. The proposed crossing design provided within the
civil plans includes treatments that will help improve the visibility, awareness, and safety.

Regional wayfinding to the campus should be provided for campus guests. For regional trips to the
campus it is recommended that signage along US 97 be coordinated with ODOT to direct visitors to the
Colorado Avenue interchange. This location provides the highest available capacity of available routes
and serves as the most direct route from US 97.

Trip Generation

University Trip Generation Characteristics
Estimates of university trips are commonly based on information contained in the standard reference
Trip Generation, 9th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). This manual
contains a compilation of mid-week surveys of suburban colleges/universities throughout the United
States. This reference provides two options for estimating trips: 1) the number of students, and 2) the
number of employees.

While the number of students is the most common metric for trip generation, this number can vary
significantly throughout the year, with fall enrollment typically higher than spring and summer. Further,
classes are usually relatively spread between Monday and Thursday, with lower attendance on Fridays.
Course enrollment typically stabilizes by the fourth week of a new term. The definition of “students”
can also be defined in two ways: as the number of full-time equivalents (FTE) or as total student
headcount. These numbers can vary widely depending on the ratio of part-time to full-time students.

The limitation of the ITE manual is that it does not identify the specific campuses surveyed, the date the
surveys were conducted, and does not distinguish between whether the number of students is based
on total headcount or full-time equivalents. The difference between these two approaches is
significant; as shown in Table 1, total headcount is approximately double the full-time equivalents.

It should be noted that campus transportation demand management and parking policies are closely
tied to trip generation. A free and abundant on-site supply of parking can encourage students to travel
to the campus by single-occupant vehicle. Policies that encourage multimodal trips (such as well-
connected multi-modal infrastructure, comfortable and convenient transit service, bicycle
accommodations, course scheduling strategies, etc.) can be used to influence the number of trips and
times at which they impact the system.


Proposed Trip Generation
For the purposes of estimating off-site transportation impacts, we have used the number of students as
the trip generation metric. We have applied maximum occupancy of the proposed buildings for both
the year 2015 and 2020 analyses periods, and have not reduced trip numbers based on the modal plans

                                                                 10                                     Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

that are under development. Additionally, we have used the total headcount numbers to define
“students”. These conservative assumptions were made to ensure that the analysis summarized herein
reflects a conservative assessment of the off-site and access impacts and needs of the campus.

Using these assumptions, we have further considered a range of trip generation rates that could be
obtained from the ITE manual. Depending on whether the peak of the university or the peak of the
roadway system is considered, trip rates could vary between 0.15 trips per student and 0.30 trips per
student, resulting in a range of 284 (91 in, 193 out) and 571 (182 in, 389 out) commute period trips. The
body of this report summarizes the transportation needs associated only with the highest trip rate
scenario; as further documented, despite the wide range of trip generation rates, the overall system
needs are consistent. Use of this range of trip rates also ensures that should travel routes vary from
what is described below, the traffic operations will remain within City thresholds.


Trip Distribution and Assignment
OSU-Cascades campus will retain an affiliation with the Central Oregon Community College and
maintain programming at the Graduate and Research Center on Columbia Street. This will allow the two
primary higher education centers for the region to leverage their collective resources and facilities. We
anticipate that student and faculty distribution patterns will largely follow the same trends as the
existing OSU-Cascades patterns at COCC.

We have worked with OSU-Cascades to obtain generalized information on student and faculty
addresses by neighborhood. This address information was available for approximately 80 percent of
current students. These addresses only identify the home of record; other trips are anticipated during
the 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. commute period associated with shopping, recreation, and entertainment
destinations. We used the distribution of student addresses as well as the consideration of other local
and regional attractions to develop the trip distribution patterns, shown in Figure 4.


System Connectivity and Performance
Our off-site analysis demonstrates that the transportation system in southwest Bend can accommodate
maximum student capacity within the 10-acre development in 2015 with the highest and most
conservative trip generation scenario. All of the study intersections will continue to meet City
standards.

The City of Bend requires a five-year analysis to assist in the planning of capital improvements. With the
additional regional growth in traffic by 2020 the Colorado Avenue and Columbia Street intersection will
exceed City standards in the most conservative trip generation scenario, but will meet standards with
the national average University trip rates. Both scenarios show that queues on the stop-controlled
northbound approach could be seven vehicles during the overall peak hour. The City’s long-range plans
identify the installation of a single lane roundabout at this intersection.

Site Access Evaluation
The analysis contained in this memorandum conservatively assumes that all site trips originate from or
are destined to the Chandler access point. This scenario evaluates the maximum potential impact to the
surrounding transportation system by loading all of the trips onto the Chandler Avenue/Century Drive
roundabout. With this assumption, the site access onto Chandler Avenue and the off-site study
intersections will operate within applicable performance standards with build-out and maximum
occupancy of the 10-acre campus.

To facilitate campus circulation and provide emergency/service access, a secondary campus access is
proposed onto Century Drive aligned with Donovan Avenue. This access will contain a single inbound
and outbound lane to enhance sight lines and maintain a narrow and prioritized pedestrian crossing. As
previously discussed, this access location will also serve as a primary pedestrian route toward nearby
retail uses. An enhanced pedestrian crossing will be constructed north of the access.

The operational effects of the Century Drive access were evaluated by assuming 30 percent of campus
trips would utilize this access under 2015 conditions. This assumption balances the convenience of this
connection to the Phase 1 parking area with the intended lower-capacity design, which will encourage
motorists to use the higher-capacity roundabout at the Century Drive intersection with Chandler
Avenue (particularly for outbound trips).

The results of the operational analysis show that the Century Drive access point will operate with low
delays and 95th percentile queues of one or two vehicles for inbound trips, and 95th percentile queues
of less than two to three vehicles for outbound trips.


LONG-RANGE PLANNING
Streetscape, intersection, and pedestrian and bicycle pathways and connections in the southwest
quadrant of Bend may benefit from some additional improvements that will better serve both
university and public needs. Many of these have been discussed in a variety of planning studies
conducted by the City of Bend and include:

         Review of the Chandler Avenue cross-section to consider bicycle and pedestrian improvements
          and parking;
         Improvements at the Colorado Avenue/Columbia Street intersection; and
         Completion of missing segments of the Century Drive sidewalk network to the north along
          privately held property.

These are not necessary as part of addressing the impacts associated with the 10-acre OSU site but will
be beneficial to the overall neighborhood and traveling public. Other comments raised by the public
include concerns about the traffic congestion experienced along the Reed Market corridor east of the
study area. Long-term solutions to this and other system issues are being addressed as part of the City’s
ongoing Transportation System Plan update efforts. These efforts will identify projects and costs, and

System Development Charges (SDC) will be applied from development throughout the entire City to
address these needs.


CAMPUS PARKING POLICY AND STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT
OSU-Cascades is developing policies and strategies to continue to reduce drive-alone trips. A Parking
Management Plan has been developed to support the 10-acre property and will be updated to support
future campus development plans, as needed. Policies and strategies included in this plan seek to
improve connectivity to COCC and the Graduate Research Center and enhance collaboration and
partnership with CET to improve transit service to the campus, establish student and faculty parking
policies, reduce future single occupancy vehicle travel to the site, and provide a robust “active mode”
environment both within the campus as well as to the adjacent commercial areas, schools, and
neighborhoods. Specific policies are further detailed within the Parking Management Plan.


KEY FINDINGS
Key findings of the analysis are summarized below.

         Traffic congestion occurs along Mt. Washington Drive during brief periods of time in the
          morning and afternoon associated with the nearby schools. The period of time that this
          congestion occurs does not coincide with the 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. analysis period required by City
          code.
         There are gaps in the pedestrian network along a privately held property on the west side of
          Century Drive north of the site and the east side of Mt. Washington Drive along the County
          landfill site.
         Bicycle lanes are provided on Mt. Washington Drive and Century Drive but not along Chandler
          Avenue.
         The existing cross-section along Chandler Avenue provides only 4-foot wide detached sidewalks,
          one travel lane in each direction, on-street parking on both sides, and shared-use bicycle
          facilities along the site frontage (and beyond).
         The Galveston/14th Street roundabout experiences a relatively high number of crashes. Crash
          records indicate that these are primarily rear-end crashes and appear to be related to adjacent
          driveways.
         Trip generation for a university campus can vary widely depending on the site location, policies,
          and strategies implemented. A range of trip generation rates was applied in this analysis to
          provide confidence that the transportation network can adequately serve the university needs.
         The trip generation scenarios assessed show that all study intersections will operate acceptably
          at build-out of the 10-acre property with maximum student capacity. This assumes a total
          headcount of 1,890 students.
         For purposes of Capital Improvement Project (CIP) planning, improvements will be needed
          within approximately 5 years of build-out and full occupancy of the 10-acre property at the


                                                       14                               Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

          Colorado Avenue/Columbia Street intersection. This intersection is already included within the
          City’s Transportation System Plan as a future single-lane roundabout.


RECOMMENDATIONS
The following summarizes the findings of the inventories, operational analysis, and safety review
conducted for development and full occupancy of the OSU Cascades development. These
recommendations are intended to support multimodal connectivity to the campus and provide a safe
and efficient transportation network.

         Primary access to the new campus should occur along Chandler Avenue. This should be
          provided as a new intersection west of Yates Drive at the apex of the curve per Figure 3. It is not
          necessary to provide turn lanes along Chandler Avenue. A secondary entrance should be
          provided onto SW Century Drive aligned with the SW Donovan Avenue intersection and
          designed as a two-lane entrance.
         An enhanced pedestrian crossing of Century Drive should be designed and constructed by the
          college at the Donovan Avenue intersection with Century Drive.
         Wayfinding to the OSU Cascades Campus should be coordinated with ODOT to include signage
          on US 97 directing students and visitors to use the Colorado Avenue interchange for campus
          access.
         OSU should coordinate with CET and the City of Bend to designate a location along the site
          frontage that can serve as a transit connection for students and faculty, and interconnect the
          transit stop with the academic and residence buildings by pathways. The transit stop should
          include a sheltered waiting area, benches, and illumination.
         OSU has developed a Parking Management Plan (PMP) detailing how the OSU-Cascades campus
          will manage vehicular parking within the campus. The PMP is a living document that should be
          updated as deemed necessary by the OSU-Cascades parking manager.
         OSU-Cascades, the Bend-La Pine School District and COCC should coordinate to understand
          programming demands and avoid, when possible, the simultaneous scheduling of regular and
          special events that may overwhelm the commonly shared transportation facilities.
         OSU should work with the City to consider how SDC funds from the campus development can
          be applied toward future multimodal transportation infrastructure needs identified for the west
          side of Bend.

Beyond these recommendations, we have worked with the overall project team to refine the campus
layout, access, and internal connectivity. Recommendations related to site access locations, internal
pathways, parking layout, and pedestrian crossings have been integrated into the current site layout.

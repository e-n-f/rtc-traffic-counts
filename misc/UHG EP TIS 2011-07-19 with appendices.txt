                                                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                   Development plans for the UHG City West AUAR site are now proposed as 100%
                   office as opposed to previous plans which contemplated mixed use. The proposed
                   development includes 1.467 million square feet of single user office space that is
                   capable of supporting up to 6,637 employees. Full development of the site is
                   anticipated by 2017. Development will be phased, with space for 2,500
                   employees by 2013 and 5,000 employees (cumulative) by 2015.

                   In terms of traffic, the current proposal is expected to generate roughly 25% more
                   trips in the peak direction (AM entering, PM exiting) compared with the land use
                   mix proposed in the previous AUAR update (2008). The proposed office campus
                   is expected to generate approximately 7,500 round-trips on a daily basis. During
                   the AM and PM peak hours, roughly 2,000 trips are expected, primarily inbound
                   in the AM and outbound in the PM.

                   In general the roadway improvements/mitigation measures identified in the most
                   recent (2008) AUAR will be needed to accommodate the growth in background
                   traffic as well as the traffic generated by the proposed office land use. Some
                   additional improvements beyond these will also be needed. One of the more
                   noteworthy additions is the need for a 2nd (dual) northbound left turn lane at the
                   TH 62 North Ramp intersection. The previous two AUARs (completed in 2001
                   and 2008) identified this improvement as being very close to necessary. Analysis
                   conducted for this report indicates that the increased traffic volumes expected as
                   part of the new development plans will move the improvement fully into the
                   "needed" category.

                   The complete set of roadway improvements recommended to provide adequate
                   level of service for operations in the vicinity of the TH 62 interchange are detailed
                   on page 28 of this report and illustrated in Figure 4-1: TH 62 Interchange Area
                   Concept Improvements.

                   Like the earlier studies, analysis suggests that an upgrade of the existing Shady
                   Oak Road bridge over TH 212 will be needed. The need for improvements at this
                   interchange are driven by a combination of factors including existing traffic
                   volumes (which approach current capacity), expected nearby development,
                   growth in background traffic, and traffic generated by the proposed UHG
                   development. This is in contrast to the improvements needed in the vicinity of the
                   TH 62 interchange, the need for which is in large part driven by proposed UHG
                   development.

                   The component of the TH 212 interchange that most limits its capacity is the short
                   distance between the East Ramp intersection and the Flying Cloud Drive (east
                   frontage road) intersection to the east. A 2009 study completed for the City of
                   Eden Prairie by SRF Consulting Group identified two potential alternatives that
                   would provide adequate capacity for the interchange through 2030. The more
                   inexpensive of the two alternatives would be to reconstruct the interchange with

                   an 8-lane bridge and relocate the intersection of Flying Cloud Drive roughly 100
                   feet to the east.

                   Analysis performed for this report supports the SRF conclusion that an 8-lane
                   bridge will be needed, assuming a worst case set of trip generation assumptions.
                   Findings also indicate that shifting the Flying Cloud Drive intersection 100 feet to
                   the east will provide further capacity enhancements. However, results of the
                   current analysis do indicate that operations would remain acceptable if the Flying
                   Cloud Drive intersection remained in its existing location under the worst case set
                   of assumptions. Figure 4-4 provides a conceptual plan for the ultimate roadway
                   geometry potentially needed in the vicinity of the TH 212 interchange.

                   Although the ultimate design of the TH 212 interchange may not require
                   relocation of the Flying Cloud Drive intersection, making this improvement does
                   help to delay the need for bridge widening. Figure 4-3 illustrates a concept plan
                   for the TH 212 interchange that provides adequate capacity through 2030 under a
                   base set of assumptions. This plan could be used as a lower cost alternative to
                   construction of the full 8-lane alternative.

                   Because an 8-lane bridge provides adequate capacity for the interchange under
                   worst case assumptions, it is the recommended design if and when
                   reconstruction/retrofitting of the bridge is undertaken. If bridge improvements are
                   made prior to relocation of the Flying Cloud Drive intersection, it is
                   recommended that that intersection remain in its current location.

                   The table on the next page provides a summary of the recommended set of
                   roadway improvements to be included for the various scenarios studied. The
                   measures identified include both improvements needed because of background
                   (non UHG-related) traffic growth and mitigation driven by the proposed UHG
                   office development.

                                                                       1.    INTRODUCTION

                   1.1      Background
                   The City West site owned by UnitedHealth Group (UHG) just east of Shady Oak
                   Road between Highways 62 and 212 in Eden Prairie has been the subject of two
                   previous AUAR traffic studies. In 2001, URS/BRW studied a mixed-use plan of
                   over one million square feet (the "2001 Study"). In 2008, RLK prepared an
                   updated traffic study for a similar land use plan (the "2008 Study"). Although the
                   2008 AUAR is less than five years old and therefore remains in effect, current
                   land use plans for the site have changed, necessitating an updated AUAR and
                   traffic study. Current development plans call for the development of a 1.467
                   million square foot/6,637 employee single-tenant office campus.

                   The purpose of this report is similar to that of the previous two AUAR traffic
                   studies, namely to identify traffic-related impacts anticipated due to site-generated
                   and background traffic and to identify and recommend geometric or other
                   measures to mitigate or offset these impacts.

                   Particular areas of concern identified in the previous AUAR traffic studies that
                   this report will address include:

                            The need for an additional left turn lane for the northbound approach at
                            the Shady Oak Road/TH 62 north ramp intersection.
                            The interim and ultimate interchange configurations needed for the Shady
                            Oak Road/TH 212 interchange.
                            The impact of the planned Southwest LRT line and City West Park-and-
                            Ride facility on traffic operations in the study area.
                            The timing of needed mitigation measures.


                   1.2      Project Location
                   The site bounded by Trunk Highway (TH) 62 to the north, Shady Oak Road
                   (Hennepin County State-Aid Highway 61) to the west, City West Parkway to the
                   south and TH 212 to the east as shown on Figure 1-1: Location Map (the
                   "Site").

                   1.3      Site Access
                   Access to the Site is proposed at two locations. One driveway access will be from
                   West 62nd Street and the other driveway access will be from City West Parkway,
                   both of which are Eden Prairie City streets. The City West Parkway is
                   constrained by limited connections to available right-of-way. The currently
                   proposed access point would align with the opposing retail driveway along City
                   West Parkway. The placement of the West 62nd Street driveway is constrained
                   due to wetlands at the site. Access points and the site in general are depicted on
                   Figure 1-2: Concept Site Plan.

                   2.1      Unchanged Assumptions
                   A majority of the assumptions remain unchanged from the 2008 study. These
                   include the following:

                            The portion of the AUAR Site north of TH 62 continues to be planned for
                            office development. Completion of this ancillary use is anticipated by
                            2017 and is included in the trip estimates for all of the 2018 and 2030
                            Build scenarios.
                            The design peak hours for analysis continue to be the AM and PM peak
                            hours, which coincide with the heaviest times of trip generation for office
                            uses. No major retail generators in the study area exist that would
                            necessitate analysis of weekend midday peak conditions.
                            The Operational Analysis Methodology continues to be
                            Synchro/SimTraffic, LOS and 95th percentile queuing. The impacts that
                            would warrant mitigation continue to be a LOS E or F, movement LOS F
                            with significant decrease in overall intersection efficiency, and 95 th
                            percentile queuing that significantly impacts upstream traffic.
                            Similar to the 2008 Study, no ramp meter analysis was undertaken. As
                            noted in the 2008 Study, the MnDOT ramp metering policy continues to
                            be significantly less restrictive than it was in 2001.

                   New and updated assumptions are covered below.


                   2.2      Intersections Studied
                   The geographic scope includes the seven Shady Oak Road intersections included
                   in the previous studies from and including the TH 62 interchange to and including
                   the TH 212 interchange and east frontage road (Flying Cloud Drive). The scope
                   for this study also includes the two internal site access driveway intersections ­
                   one each on West 62nd Street and City West Parkway. The City West Parkway
                   driveway was analyzed in the 2001 Study. The West 62nd Street driveway was not
                   analyzed in either study.

                   The geometry of the study-area intersections was verified by Westwood in a field
                   review conducted in November 2010. No changes to existing geometry have
                   occurred since publication of the 2008 AUAR.

                   2.3      Design Years
                   Consistent with the previous studies, the City of Eden Prairie Comprehensive Plan
                   year 2030 was included as the ultimate design year for this study. The design
                   years also included 2018, which is the year after full build out, and two interim
                   years that correspond with UHG phases 1 and 2 (discussed in greater detail
                   below).


                   2.4      Existing Traffic Volumes
                   Updated manual turning movement counts were collected by Westwood in
                   November 2010. The current AM Peak Hour (7:15 ­ 8:15 AM) and PM Peak
                   Hour (4:30 ­ 5:30 PM) volumes for each of the study area's seven intersections at
                   the Site are illustrated in Figure 2-1: Existing Peak Hour Turning Movement
                   Counts. The updated counts are similar to the counts conducted for the 2008
                   AUAR.

                   The most current Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes for the study area
                   roadway network as published by the Minnesota Department of Transportation
                   (MnDOT) are shown on Figure 2-2: Existing Average Daily Traffic.

                   2.5      Background Growth
                   This study accounts for two components of background growth: (1) an annual rate
                   applicable to all existing turning movements at all intersections; and (2) specific
                   developments in and around the study area that are anticipated by the City of
                   Eden Prairie to develop prior to the ultimate design horizon of the study (2030).
                   This two-component process is similar to that used for the previous studies.

                   2.5.1 Specific Background Development
                   The sites expected to develop or redevelop prior to 2030, as identified by the City
                   are:

                            SuperValu Eastview Campus (on Flying Cloud Drive south of Shady Oak
                            Road);
                            Redevelopment within City West (although not formally proposed, City
                            staff anticipates redevelopment of City West due to the change in UHG
                            land use from mixed-use to office);
                            Infill of existing vacancies within City West. These vacancies include
                            general office space and general light industrial space. Current occupancy
                            within the City West area is approximately 50%. Full occupancy is
                            assumed by 2030 for all 2030 scenarios, including the No-Build scenario.
                            UHG Data Park East Building (located in the Opus business park,
                            currently under construction as of June 2011); and
                            City West LRT Park and Ride facility. This facility is schematically
                            shown in Southwest LRT planning documents.

                   The magnitude of trips anticipated to be generated by each of these developments
                   is shown in the table below. Details on the calculations behind these estimates are
                   available in the Appendix under Trip Generation Components Matrix, Trip
                   Generation Rates Summary and City West Redevelopment Internal Trip
                   Capture Calculation.

                   The LRT trip rate calculation involved a review of ITE's Trip Generation, 8th
                   Edition (2008) estimates together with local data from a 2010 Spack Consulting
                   study of the Metro Transit Maplewood Park-and-Ride station, a 2006 SRF
                   Consulting Group study of the Bloomington 28th Avenue Park-and-Ride and data
                   collected at Southwest Station (Eden Prairie) and the 28th Avenue LRT Park-and-
                   Ride by U of M students as part of a 2011 Capstone Senior design project
                   mentored by Nick Erpelding (Westwood) and Randy Newton (City of Eden
                   Prairie). Details are available in the Appendix - See City West Park-and-Ride
                   Trip Generation Rate Estimate Calculations.

                     residential units, a 125-room hotel, and 8,000 s.f. of restaurant(s). Assumed infill includes 140,000 s.f. of general office
                     and 60,000 s.f. of general light industrial.


                     2.5.2 Overall Background Growth Rate
                     The method for forecasting an annual background growth rate was similar to that
                     used in the 2008 Study. Daily trip estimates associated with all of the
                     development anticipated in the City of Eden Prairie Comprehensive Plan were
                     distributed and assigned throughout the study area and added to existing turning
                     movement counts. Included were trips associated with the previous AUAR land
                     uses for the UHG Site. Not included were trips generated by potential future
                     redevelopment within City West (which is not included in the City's
                     Comprehensive Plan). Westwood then calculated an annual growth rate to be
                     applied solely to the existing traffic volumes so that the 2030 ADTs along Shady
                     Oak Road matched the City Comprehensive Plan estimates. The resulting annual
                     rate calculated was 0.55%. This rate is higher than that assumed in the 2008
                     Study (0.25%) and lower than the rate included in the 2001 Study (1.0%).


                     2.6        UHG Trip Generation
                     As mentioned, previous plans for the Site in the 2001 and 2008 Studies were for
                     mixed-use development. Current development plans call for an office campus
                     with 6,637 employees over 1,467,000 square feet. A comparison of the
                     previously- and currently-planned uses is shown in Table 2-2: AUAR Land Use
                     Comparison.

                            Phase 2 (construction complete in 2015): 5,000 employees (cumulative)
                            Full Build (construction complete in 2017): 6,637 employees (cumulative)

                   The interim design years for the study were selected to fit with the year after
                   build-out of Phases 1 and 2, for 2014 and 2016 respectively.

                   To accurately gauge the trip generation potential of the UHG office land use,
                   Westwood conducted counts at two current UHG sites in the Twin Cities Metro
                   area. Counts were conducted for three hours in the morning and three hours in the
                   afternoon to capture both the AM and PM peak hours. The total number of trips
                   in the peak hours for both sites were combined to develop an overall UHG rate.
                   Details are provided in the Appendix under UHG Office Trip Rate Calculation.

                   The rate developed was compared to Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
                   rates in Trip Generation, 8th Edition, for Corporate Headquarters (714) and Single
                   Tenant (715). It was found that the UHG rates fell among the middle of the ITE
                   range for these office land uses, indicating the use of the UHG data would not
                   result in an underestimation of the trip generation potential of the site. See the
                   UHG vs. ITE Trip Generation chart in the Appendix for more detail.

                   UHG rates were initially developed on both a per-1,000 s.f. and per-employee
                   basis. Because a proposed employee count is available for the UHG office use,
                   the rate chosen for the analysis was the per-employee rate. Using a per-employee
                   rate eliminates the unknown of employee density per square foot, ostensibly
                   resulting in a more accurate trip forecast.


                   2.6.1 "Large Campus" Reduction
                   The proposed UHG campus is significantly larger than the combined sizes of the
                   two surrogate sites counted, and is also larger than the all of the data points in
                   ITE's Trip Generation for ITE Corporate Headquarters (714) and Single Tenant

                   (715). For nearly all land use categories, including 714 and 715, the data points
                   for a given plot show a decrease in trip generation rate (per employee or s.f.) as
                   the size of the independent variable (square footage or number of employees)
                   increases. This effect is the reason that a downward sloping fitted curve equation
                   is provided for many of the land use categories, especially where a large number
                   of data points are present. To avoid overestimating the trip generation of the
                   UHG campus, a reduction factor was applied to account for this effect. Based on
                   the sizes of the sites at which surrogate counts were taken, an reduction could be
                   as large as 19% (see Appendix ­ Large Campus Factor Calculation). To avoid
                   over-correcting, the reduction factor applied was 6% for Full Build, 4% for Phase
                   2, and was disregarded entirely for Phase 1.

                   2.6.2 TDM Reduction
                   An attempt was also made to forecast the impact that a Travel Demand
                   Management (TDM) plan would have on the Site's trip generation. Very little
                   information could be found in support of a particular percentage reduction that
                   would be appropriate for a large office campus similar to UHG's proposed
                   campus. Data provided by the 494 Corridor Commission points to a reduction
                   rate in the low single digits. The fact that the UHG office campus is proposed as
                   a single user familiar with successful implementation of TDM plans increases the
                   likelihood that a TDM plan will be successful in eliminating peak hour trips. (It
                   should be noted that the sites at which the surrogate trips counts were taken did
                   not have formal TDM plans.) In view of these factors, a three percent (3%)
                   reduction for TDM was applied to the trip forecasts for each of the time horizons.
                   It should also be noted that the percentage reduction assumed applies to trip totals.
                   Since there is not necessarily a 1:1 ratio between number of participants in a TDM
                   plan and number of trips eliminated (a carpool of two employees eliminates only
                   one trip), the percentage of participants in the UHG TDM program will likely
                   need to be higher than 3%.

                   2.6.3 LRT Reduction
                   The Southwest LRT line is expected to be operational by 2018. This timeline
                   means that that LRT service is expected to be available at the time full build-out
                   of the UHG campus is complete. It is anticipated that there could be a fairly large
                   Southwest LRT ridership among UHG employees given that the City West station
                   would be less than half a mile (1/2 mile) from the UHG campus as currently
                   planned. UHG ridership is further anticipated to increase over time as employees
                   are able to make choices about where to live and how to commute. National data
                   researched in support of a LRT ridership rate for suburban offices located near a
                   LRT station was limited, but did show the potential for double-digit ridership.
                   Because of the relatively new status of LRT in the Twin Cities, a two percent
                   (2%) LRT ridership was assumed for 2018 increasing to five percent (5%) in
                   2030.

                   2.6.4 UHG Trip Generation Summary
                   The resulting trip generation estimates for the UHG campus for the various design
                   scenarios are shown in Table 2-3 below. The totals shown include the reductions
                   for Large Campus, TDM and LRT.

                       2.7        Trip Distribution
                       Four separate trip distribution patterns were used according to the specific trip
                       being added:

                                  UHG site-generated trips and trips generated by redevelopment in the City
                                  West area were distributed according to data provided by the Metropolitan
                                  Council. This trip distribution pattern is illustrated in Figure 2-3 below.
                                  For details, see Metropolitan Council TAZ 545 Trip Distribution in the
                                  Appendix.
                                  Trips generated by land uses in the Opus business park north of TH 62,
                                  including the ancillary office use portion of the AUAR site and the UHG
                                  Data Park East Building currently under construction were distributed
                                  according to a 2006 study prepared by WSB for the UHG Data Park
                                  development. See Figure 2-4.
                                  Best Buy Corporate Campus trips were distributed per a 2006 study
                                  prepared by Wenck. This distribution pattern is illustrated in Figure 2-5.
                                  Finally, trips generated by the City West Park-and-Ride were distributed
                                  according to data provided by the Metropolitan Council, as illustrated in
                                  Figure 2-6. Detailed calculation of the distribution for the LRT Park-and-

                   2.8       Sensitivity Analysis / Worst Case Scenarios
                   As discussed above, several assumptions regarding trip rate, LRT ridership, TDM
                   compliance, and large campus trip reduction impacts were made when forecasting
                   trip generation in order to get to estimates most likely to be accurate. While all of
                   these assumptions are intended to be conservative and fact-based, given the
                   uncertainty of combined assumptions, a sensitivity analysis of a worst case
                   scenario was conducted for the 2018 and 2030 design years. For these Worst
                   Case scenarios, the large campus effect and TDM participation are neglected and
                   LRT ridership is assumed to remain at 2% for both the 2018 and 2030 design
                   years (rather than increasing to 5% for the 2030 design year). The resulting UHG
                   trip generation estimates for this sensitivity analysis are shown below.

                   In addition to changes related to assumptions for UHG trip generation,
                   assumptions for the City West LRT Park-and-Ride were also adjusted for the
                   Worst Case Scenarios. Based on information provided by Metro Transit, the
                   range of sizes anticipated for the facility is 200 to 600 stalls. To provide a slightly
                   more conservative look, 300 stalls were assumed for the base scenarios with LRT.
                   For the Worst Case Scenarios, a 600-stall facility was assumed. The trip
                   generation estimates associated with a 600-stall facility are as follows:

                   Accounting for the specific background development, general background
                   growth, and UHG trips (for Build scenarios) as discussed above, forecasts of

                   4.1      Terminology
                   Using the roadway geometric and traffic volume data described above as input,
                   traffic operational analysis was performed per the standards set out in the 2000
                   Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board.
                   Synchro/SimTraffic 7 was used to complete the analysis.

                   Two fundamental outputs from the model are typically used to characterize traffic
                   flow. The first is Level of Service (LOS), a letter grade ranging from "A" (free
                   flow) to "F" (over-saturated forced flow). Generally, Level of Service D
                   represents the threshold for acceptable overall intersection operating conditions
                   during a peak hour in the Twin Cities metro area. On an individual movement
                   basis, LOS E is typically considered the lowest acceptable LOS. LOS results
                   from SimTraffic are reported in the tables in the following sections within the
                   body of this report. LOS results from both Synchro and SimTraffic are reported
                   in the Appendix.

                   For movements operating at LOS F, the second important output to consider from
                   the model is queuing. A queue is a line of vehicles waiting to pass through an
                   intersection. While an intersection may be reported as operating at an acceptable
                   level of service, queues from the intersection extending to upstream intersections
                   or driveways could create a potential safety issue. The 95th percentile queue is
                   typically considered the standard for design purposes. The microsimulation
                   component of the model, SimTraffic, is best suited for reporting queuing between
                   closely-spaced intersections. An average of five simulations is reported both in
                   the overall LOS tables in the text below as well as in the detailed results tables
                   presented in the Appendix.


                   4.2      Reporting Process
                   The scenarios analyzed will be covered in the following order:

                   After summarizing existing results, conditions in 2018 (year after Full UHG Build
                   out) will be described in order to gauge the full extent of improvements and
                   mitigation needed. Second, 2030 build conditions will be examined to assess
                   whether additional future improvements may be needed due to additional growth
                   in background traffic.

                   Next, results from the Worst Case/Sensitivity Analysis will be described.
                   Recommendations for improvements/mitigation that may be necessary if traffic
                   volumes are higher than expected (or simply to provide additional reserve
                   capacity) will be described.

                   Last, results from analysis of the interim (2014 and 2016) design years will be
                   covered. The primary purpose of studying these design years is to assess when
                   the recommended full-build improvements/mitigation measures will be required.

                   Complete details of the recommended improvements/mitigation measures for
                   each scenario are included in the Recommended Mitigation Summary Matrix
                   included at the beginning of this report in the Executive Summary. A detailed
                   version of this table ­ Detailed Mitigation Summary Matrix ­ is included in the
                   Appendix.

                   In general, operations under existing conditions are acceptable. The only issues
                   occur at the 212 interchange. Under existing signal timing, LOS F and long
                   queues on the southbound approach to the East Ramp intersection are present.
                   Analysis shows that updated signal timing for the AM peak would improve
                   movement LOS and reduce queuing to acceptable levels.

                   Operations for the 2018 No-Build scenario with existing geometry and signal
                   timing show primarily acceptable conditions in the vicinity of the TH 62
                   interchange. The one exception is the need for minor signal retiming at the City
                   West (North) intersection to improve LOS on the eastbound approach.

                   The analysis shows that additional capacity will be needed at the 212 interchange
                   for No-Build conditions. The recommended capacity additions include an
                   additional southbound approach lane at the west ramp, and two additional
                   northbound approach lanes at the east ramp. At the Flying Cloud Drive
                   intersection, conversion of the southbound through lane to a shared southbound
                   through/right turn lane is also recommended. In addition to these geometric
                   improvements, complete signal timing of the four-signal corridor is
                   recommended.

                   With these mitigation measures in place the capacity of the interchange is
                   increased just enough to meet acceptable thresholds, with PM LOS at Flying
                   Cloud Drive near the D/E border. The bottleneck at the interchange, and the
                   reason for the marginal LOS in the PM at Flying Cloud, is actually the East Ramp
                   intersection, where three critical movements compete for the available capacity:
                   eastbound left, westbound through, and northbound left. Compounding the
                   capacity issue is that many of the westbound through vehicles are looking to be in
                   the left-most lane in anticipation of a left turn at the west ramp intersection.

                   Two options are available for further increasing capacity of the interchange
                   beyond those already mentioned. The first is to increase the spacing of the east
                   ramp and Flying Cloud intersections either by moving Flying Cloud east or by
                   moving the east ramp intersection slightly west. The second is to widen the
                   bridge over TH 212.

                   Though it appears that these additional mitigation measures can be avoided for
                   2018 No-Build conditions, very little spare capacity will be available at the
                   interchange.

                   As shown in the table above, a number of mitigation measures will be required to
                   accommodate full build out of the planned UHG campus, with many of these
                   concentrated in the TH 62 interchange area. The improvements needed in the
                   vicinity of the TH 212 interchange area needed less as a direct result of UHG but
                   rather as a combination of existing traffic, other background development, along
                   with traffic from the proposed UHG City West campus.

                   TH 62 Interchange Area
                   In the vicinity of TH 62, the following improvements are recommended for 2018
                   Build conditions to accommodate UHG traffic (these are illustrated in Figure 4-1
                   below):

                            TH 62 North Ramps
                                o Additional northbound left turn lane. Widening should occur to
                                  the east underneath the TH 62 bridges to avoid impacts to the
                                  existing bridge columns. This may result in the need for a
                                  retaining wall along the east bridge embankments.
                                o Extension of the storage bays for the northbound left turn lanes.
                                  The right-most of the two lanes should extend back to and through
                                  the TH 62 South Ramps intersection.
                            TH 62 South Ramps
                                o Additional eastbound approach lane.
                                o 4-lane westbound approach with 2 eastbound departure lanes.
                                o Additional northbound approach lane (3 through lanes). This lane
                                  is an extension of the north ramps northbound left turn lane.
                                o Northbound right turn lane (500 feet of storage).
                                o Additional southbound left turn lane.
                                o Extension of the storage bays for the southbound left turn lanes.
                            City West (North)
                                o The intersection should be reconstructed to include northbound and
                                  southbound left turn lanes to allow for left turn phasing (instead of
                                  split phasing). The southbound left turn lane should be designed
                                  with 500 feet of storage.
                                o Northbound right turn lane (500 feet of storage).

                   Site Driveways
                   The following changes are recommended at the site access driveways:

                            West 62nd Street Driveway (new with site development)
                                o All approaches should be two lanes.
                                o Channelization should be provided to allow for dual rights
                                   eastbound (to ensure that both southbound left turn lanes on Shady
                                   Oak Road are fully utilized).
                                o Left turns should be allowed from both northbound lanes to
                                   accommodate a heavy PM northbound left turn movement.
                                o Side street stop control is recommended. The northbound
                                   approach should be considered the major street, with the eastbound
                                   and westbound legs receiving stop control. The eastbound right
                                   turn movement should be free flowing.
                            City West Driveway (3-leg intersection currently exists; 4th (north) leg to
                            be added with UHG development)
                                o Two-lane southbound approach.
                                o Channelization with yield control to accommodate the heavy PM
                                   southbound right turn movement.
                                o Stop control for left lane (left turn and through movements) on the
                                   southbound approach.

                   TH 212 Interchange Area
                   A study of how best to accommodate additional traffic at the Shady Oak / TH 212
                   interchange was undertaken by the City of Eden Prairie and performed by SRF
                   Consulting Group in 2009. The primary conclusion from this study was that a
                   diamond interchange (as currently exists) is the most effective interchange
                   configuration. Ultimately, SRF's projections show that an 8-lane bridge will be
                   required (assuming a standard diamond configuration). SRF further recommends
                   that the intersection of Flying Cloud Drive (the east frontage road) should be
                   relocated as far east as feasible (approximately 100 feet) in order to maximize
                   capacity of the interchange.

                   Reconstruction of the interchange to a single-point configuration would provide
                   additional capacity compared with the 8-lane diamond, but at nearly double the
                   cost.

                   Accordingly, the geometric improvements and mitigation recommended for the
                   TH 212 interchange area are items that would continue to provide value after the
                   interchange is reconstructed (assuming a standard diamond configuration).

                   The following improvements in the vicinity of the TH 212 interchange are
                   recommended:

                                o The intersection should be reconstructed to include eastbound and
                                   westbound left turn lanes to allow for left turn phasing.

                                o Channelize eastbound right turn lane and allow for right turns from
                                   shared through/right middle lane. Widen southbound on ramp to

                            Flying Cloud Drive
                                o Reconstruct and relocate intersection approximately 100 feet east
                                   to maximize space for westbound queuing between the East Ramp
                                   intersection and Flying Cloud intersection. If intersection is not
                                   moved, the Shady Oak Road bridge over TH 212 should be
                                   widened.

                   With these measures in place, acceptable operations are forecasted by the model.

                   4.4.3 2018 Build with LRT
                   Conditions with the Southwest LRT line and City West station and Park-and-Ride
                   operations are similar to conditions without. Operations are slightly improved in
                   most locations due to the 2% reduction in UHG traffic. The only intersections
                   forecasted to see increased traffic are those in the vicinity of the City West Station
                   due to park-and-ride traffic.

                   To accommodate the additional traffic at the West 62nd Street site driveway
                   intersection conversion to traffic signal control may be necessary, and is
                   recommended if and when warranted.

                   Operations with these additions in place show acceptable operations:

                   An alternative mitigation option for the West 62nd Street site driveway is
                   construction of a roundabout. A roundabout would provide the following
                   benefits. First, northbound left turns during the PM would be nearly free flow,
                   reducing delays and queuing. Similarly, AM eastbound rights would endure
                   minimal delay.

                   A roundabout would also help in terms of access to the existing BP gas station on
                   the northeast corner of Shady Oak Road and West 62nd Street. Due to the
                   expected length of westbound queues on West 62nd Street approaching Shady Oak
                   Road, the following access changes are recommended for the BP gas station
                   driveways onto West 62nd Street:

                            Full Closure of the westerly of the two driveways.
                            Limitation of access at the easterly driveway to right-in/right-out only by
                            construction of a full median on West 62nd Street.

                   With a roundabout at the West 62nd Street UHG driveway intersection, vehicles
                   attempting to access the BP gas station from Shady Oak Road would turn onto
                   West 62nd Street, pass the BP driveway, make a u-turn at the roundabout, then
                   return to the gas station and make a right-in. All vehicles exiting the station
                   would make a right out onto West 62nd Street (similar to existing operations).

                   The primary disadvantage of a roundabout is the potential for westbound queues
                   to extend from Shady Oak Road back into and through the roundabout. If queues
                   extend far enough, access to West 62nd Street east of the roundabout could
                   conceivably become blocked until the queue can clear. If eastbound traffic is
                   heavy enough, the ensuing queue could extend back to Shady Oak Road. In
                   theory, if this queue were to prevent the westbound queue from clearing, gridlock
                   could ensure. In reality, the likelihood of this occurring is exceedingly low.

                   Another potential disadvantage of a roundabout is cost. Because West 62nd Street
                   will need to be completely reconstructed at the time of UHG build out, the
                   relative cost of a roundabout vs. a conventional intersection is similar. However,
                   if a conventional intersection is constructed first, retrofitting the intersection with



Traffic Impact Study ­ UHG City West Office Campus             Page 31                          July 19, 2011
                   a roundabout would be relatively expensive, due to the need to completely
                   reconstruct the intersection.

                   Related to the cost concern is the potential for additional right-of-way to be
                   needed for a roundabout. The figure below shows conceptually how a roundabout
                   would fit at the intersection. If the size of the roundabout were to increase, as is
                   sometimes needed as part of the design process to ensure proper geometrics,
                   additional right-of-way may be required.




Traffic Impact Study ­ UHG City West Office Campus           Page 32                         July 19, 2011
                   The other site access intersection also presents an interesting design challenge.
                   Though the City West Parkway driveway is forecasted to operate acceptably, the
                   distance between this driveway and Shady Oak Road is even smaller compared to
                   that of the West 62nd Street driveway. The likely way in which operations at the
                   intersection would begin to break down if traffic volumes exceed expectations
                   would be for westbound queues from Shady Oak Road to extend to and through
                   the intersection, potentially blocking other movements from occurring.

                   Design solutions for this potential issue are not as apparent as for the issues
                   present at the West 62nd Street driveway. First, an all-way stop is less desirable in
                   this location due to both the shorter separation from Shady Oak Road and the
                   comparatively higher traffic volumes on City West Parkway, particularly
                   eastbound through traffic. The potential for eastbound queues from an all-way
                   stop to spill back to Shady Oak Road is more significant at this driveway location.
                   Further, experience has shown that all-way stop controlled intersections with
                   moderate to high volumes on more than one approach tend to operate less
                   efficiently and safely than they theoretically should, due to driver apprehension
                   about navigating these relatively large intersections.

                   A roundabout is less desirable at the City West Parkway driveway intersection
                   primarily because of similar reasons.

                   A traffic signal is a potential solution for this intersection. The primary issue with
                   a traffic signal (but the reason for its potential value) would be the need to time
                   the signal in coordination with Shady Oak Road to eliminate the possibility of
                   eastbound queues extending back to Shady Oak Road.

                   The only time period for which a traffic signal would provide addition value
                   beyond side-street stop control is during the AM peak period. During this time
                   period vehicles looking to make a left turn out of the retail area to the south would
                   need to look for a gap in the heavy eastbound to northbound left turning traffic
                   flow entering the UHG site. Volumes on this northbound left turn movement
                   during the AM peak are very low (less than 50 vph), however, and would not
                   meet warrants for a traffic signal (100 ­ 150 vph). Experience has shown that
                   drivers at side street stop controlled intersections not warranting signalization are
                   able to find sufficient gaps to enter the mainline or will divert to another route. It
                   is expected that this will be the case for this intersection.

                   During the PM peak, a traffic signal is not needed to allow minor street traffic to
                   enter City West Parkway, due to the fact that the predominant flow is expected to
                   southbound right turn movements out of the UHG campus toward Shady Oak
                   Road. Traffic volumes on other movements, especially minor street to major
                   street lefts and minor street crossing movements are expected to be low.
                   Specifically, the number of southbound lefts and/or through movements are
                   expected to be less than 50 vph. The model shows that volume for these
                   movements would need to grow to over 300 vph to reach a failing level of service
                   for 2018 conditions, and to over 150 vph for 2030 worst case conditions.

                   Three additional alternatives were explored for the City West site driveway
                   intersection. The first was conversion to 3-way stop control, with the eastbound
                   approach being free-flowing. The benefit of this approach would be to guarantee
                   free flow for the heavy AM eastbound left turn movement. Because westbound
                   approach volumes are relatively low for all scenarios, acceptable LOS is
                   attainable via this configuration for all scenarios (including the worst case
                   scenarios).

                   The second design alternative investigated was conversion to three-quarter access.
                   Under three-quarter configuration no crossing or left turn movements from the
                   minor approaches would be allowed. Although this configuration provides
                   improved level of service, egress from the retail area to the south is negatively
                   impacted. If a logical u-turn location can be found on City West parkway further
                   to the east, this solution may be workable.

                   The final design alternative studied was conversion of the left-most eastbound
                   approach lane to a dedicated left turn lane via striping and signage. This design
                   alternative would not change the operational characteristics of the intersection,
                   but could improve safety by lessening the likelihood for rear-end collisions in the
                   left hand lane on the eastbound approach.

                   Since adequate (and available spare) capacity is forecasted for this and future
                   scenarios, two-way stop control (or 3-way stop control) is the recommended
                   intersection control configuration for this intersection. If and when warranted by
                   observation and/or review of crash data, conversion of the left-hand eastbound
                   approach lane to left turn movements only through striping and signage is
                   recommended.

                   Under the 2030 Build scenarios, the mitigation measures identified for 2018 Build
                   conditions in the vicinity of the TH 62 interchange remain adequate.

                   In the vicinity of the TH 212 interchange, the interim improvement of shifting the
                   intersection of Flying Cloud Drive 100 feet east is not sufficient to provide
                   adequate capacity for the interchange.

                   The recommended additional mitigation measures for the 2030 Build scenario are
                   to widen the TH 212 bridge to 6 lanes and to shift the location of the east ramp
                   intersection west 50 feet. Widening the bridge to 6 lanes doubles the available
                   storage for the westbound left turn lane at the West Ramp intersection. Shifting
                   the east ramp intersection west 50 feet increases the available westbound storage
                   space between the east ramp and Flying Cloud Drive enough to bring the Flying
                   Cloud Drive intersection up to the D/E threshold. Being at this threshold suggests
                   that little, if any, reserve capacity is available with this solution, and that long
                   queues for many of movements are experienced. Observation of the SimTraffic
                   model confirms that long queues on many movements do occur, but also that
                   these queues do not result in significant upstream blockages that would limit
                   capacity.

                   The figure on the following page illustrates the recommended mitigation for a 6-
                   lane bridge solution.

                   Also needed in the vicinity of the TH 212 interchange for the 2030 conditions is
                   an additional (dual) southbound left turn lane at the intersection of Shady Oak
                   Road and City West Parkway (South). The need for this additional lane is driven
                   by the combination of site-generated traffic using City West Parkway in the PM
                   peak hour to exit the site and additional traffic associated with Redevelopment
                   and infill of existing vacancies within the City West area.

                   Because of the low through and right-turn volumes on the northbound approach at
                   the City West (South) intersection, the addition of a 2nd southbound left turn lane
                   does not provide a substantial increase in capacity, under the assumption that
                   signal phasing for the southbound left turn movement must change from
                   protected/permitted to protected only. It is recommended that protected/permitted
                   phasing be considered for the southbound left turn movement if and when dual
                   lefts are constructed for this movement in order to maximize green time on Shady
                   Oak Road.

                   Operations for the scenario with LRT are again very similar to those without. The
                   reduced UHG traffic volumes associated with LRT usage do improve operations
                   in the vicinity of the TH 212 interchange slightly.

                   The next section of the report looks at operations with an 8-lane bridge in place at
                   TH 212, confirming that adequate capacity can be provided with this additional
                   improvement, even under the additional traffic loading assumed as part of the set
                   of worst case trip generation assumptions.

                   With expansion of the bridge over TH 212 to 8 lanes, the list of
                   improvements/mitigation identified earlier is sufficient to provide acceptable
                   operations throughout the network.

                   Further, relocation of the Flying Cloud intersection 100 feet to the east is not
                   necessary to provide an acceptable level of service. Relocation of the Flying
                   Cloud intersection, if undertaken however, will provide benefit in terms of
                   reduced queuing and further improvements to LOS.

                   The figure on the next page illustrates the recommend configuration of the TH
                   212 interchange with an 8-lane bridge. Because an 8-lane bridge provides
                   adequate capacity for the interchange under the set worst case assumptions
                   analyzed for this study, it is recommended that it be the design chosen if and
                   when reconstruction/retrofitting of the bridge is undertaken. If bridge
                   improvements are made prior to relocation of the Flying Cloud Drive intersection,
                   it is recommended that relocation of the Flying Cloud Drive intersection be
                   postponed until the need for this improvement is demonstrated.

                   Beyond the TH 212 interchange, the added traffic associated with the assumptions
                   made for the worst case scenario also causes operations at the two site driveways
                   to degrade noticeably. At the City West Parkway driveway during the AM peak,
                   some diversion of vehicles from the northbound left movement will begin to
                   occur, due to the long wait and reduction in available gaps. However, with a
                   small number of vehicles diverting (roughly 20 vph, or half of the total amount),
                   overall intersection LOS remains at an acceptable D.

                   At the West 62nd Street Driveway, traffic signal control continues to provide
                   acceptable operations at the intersection. However, with slightly less traffic some
                   form of stop control may remain adequate. Because of the potential that stop
                   control may ultimately provide adequate capacity for the intersection, it is the
                   recommended configuration for the intersection (as opposed to a roundabout). If
                   and when signalization is needed a traffic signal can be installed with minimal or
                   no changes to the intersection geometry.

                   At the intersection of Shady Oak Road and the TH 62 South Ramps/West 62nd
                   Street, the additional traffic associated with the worst case scenario results in the
                   need for some lane use and phasing changes to maximize capacity. Under the
                   worst case scenarios (2030 and 2018), during the AM peak, additional capacity
                   can be gained by altering the lane assignments on the eastbound approach.
                   Specifically, converting the right-hand left turn lane to a shared left turn/through
                   lane (to make L-LT-T-R) would better accommodate the heavy eastbound through
                   movement.

                   Because of the shared lane, signal phasing changes would be required to eliminate
                   the potential for rear-end collisions. The change recommended is the elimination
                   of the protected westbound left turn phase during the AM peak period. During
                   the AM peak period, traffic volume on the westbound left turn movement is very
                   low and can be adequately served with permitted phasing only. Though dual lefts
                   with permitted phasing are rare, they can operate acceptably, especially under low
                   volume conditions. This signal phasing configuration is accordingly
                   recommended for all of the 2018 and 2030 Build scenarios.

                   In order to be able to vary signal phasing and lane assignment by time of day,
                   some additional signage and signal equipment will be required. First, to vary lane
                   assignment by time of day, variable overhead lane assignment signs will be
                   required. It is anticipated that the cost of such signage would be less than the
                   alternative ­ addition of a fifth eastbound approach lane ­ after accounting for
                   right-of-way costs. Second, to vary phasing by time of day, the use of flashing
                   yellow arrow signal indications is recommended.

                   4.6.2 2018 Build with LRT Worst Case
                   Analysis of worst case conditions for the 2018 design year were also undertaken.
                   Results indicate that a 6-lane bridge, similar to that needed for 2030 Build
                   conditions (non worst-case) would be needed, with the modification that



Traffic Impact Study ­ UHG City West Office Campus            Page 41                        July 19, 2011
                   relocation of the TH 212 East Ramp intersection 50 feet to the west would not be
                   needed.

                   No changes to the set of improvements/mitigation in the vicinity of the TH 62
                   interchange would be required.

                   LOS results of the analysis of 2018 Worst Case conditions with the 6-lane bridge

                   4.7      Timing of Build improvements
                   Analysis of conditions post-Phase 1 (2014) and post-Phase 2 (2016) were
                   conducted in order to identify when the recommended improvements/mitigation
                   identified for 2018 would be needed.

                   4.7.1 Phase 1

                                              Town of Chapel Hill: Draft Traffic Impact Study
                                   Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill – Proposed Day Care Center


I. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Project Overview

A new day care center facility named The Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill, to be located along
N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) at Westminster Drive, is being proposed in Chapel
Hill. The project will be a redevelopment of an existing small child care facility that is being run
by The Children’s Campus. Figure 1 (found in Appendix A) shows the general location of the
site. The project is anticipated to be fully complete by 2014. This report analyzes the full build-
out scenario for the year 2015 (one year after anticipated completion), the no-build scenario for
2015, as well as 2013 existing year traffic conditions.

The proposed site concept plan shows one direct, full movement access driveway to
Westminster Drive. No other vehicular access connections are proposed. Figure 2 displays
the preliminary concept plan of The Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill and nearby land uses and
roadways. The current plan includes a two-story building with a capacity for 192 students and
12,500 square feet of floor area. 43 on-site surface and structure parking spaces will also be
provided. The existing facility has 2,029 square feet of space for a maximum of 12 students and
features 7 on-site parking spaces.

B. Site Location and Study Area

This report analyzes and presents the transportation impacts that Children’s Campus of Chapel
Hill will have on the following intersections in the project study area:

       NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Weaver Dairy Road
       NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Westminster Drive
       NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Stateside Drive
       Weaver Dairy Road and Banks Drive
       Westminster Drive and Banks Drive

The impacts of the proposed site at the study area intersections will be evaluated during the
AM, noon, and PM peak hours of an average weekday. The following study is based on
background traffic for the existing year, 2013, and the year following the estimated site build out
year of 2014, as well as the estimated net site-generated traffic produced by the redeveloped
day care facility

There are numerous Town-approved future developments in, or just beyond, the immediate
project study area that were considered to be constructed by 2015 and may generate additional
background traffic. An area-wide ambient future traffic growth percentage of 1.50 percent per
year was applied to the existing volumes, based on historical average annual daily traffic
(AADT) growth rate data provided by the Town of Chapel Hill and NCDOT, and consistent with
recent study area traffic impact studies.

                                 Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill – Proposed Day Care Center


C. Site Description

The Children’s Campus site is currently
occupied by a residential building that has
been converted to a small day care facility
run by the Children’s Campus (Applicant)
and is surrounded by existing single family
and multi-family residential neighborhoods.
Additional residential subdivisions are
present to the south and east of the site,
with some significant commercial and retail
development along Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard and Weaver Dairy Road
(Timberlyne Shopping Center) to the north
and east.
                                                          Existing Day Care Facility
The proposed site will have frontage along
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard but will have no vehicular access to this road. Access is
proposed only along Westminster Drive and is to be located as far east from the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Drive intersection as possible (approximately 300 feet away). The proposed site plan,
shown in Figure 2, indicates all parking will be accommodated on-site, with surface and
covered parking facilities. Sidewalk connections and bicycle racks are also shown on the site
plan.

D. Existing and Proposed Uses in Vicinity of Site

The land uses and development in the study area are primarily residential, with some higher
density commercial areas located along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Weaver Dairy
Road. The Existing Land Use Plan shown in the 2020 Town of Chapel Hill Comprehensive Plan
and adopted June 25, 2012, indicates that the proposed site is designated as “institutional”.
The Future Land Use Plan, that is also a part of the Town Comprehensive Plan, indicates that
the parcel would be included in a “Town/Village Center” that also includes the Timberlyne
Shopping Center and areas north of Weaver Dairy Road east of NC 86. The recently updated
Comprehensive Plan also indicates that this parcel is a “Development Opportunity Area” and a
“Future Focus Discussion Area”. The parcel is currently zoned “R-2” – allowing low density
residential development with up to two units per acre.

E. Existing and Committed Surface Transportation Network

Roadways
The Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill project study area features several major arterial
roadways serving areas throughout the Town of Chapel Hill and points beyond, as well as a
number of collector and local access streets. Table 1, on the following page, summarizes
pertinent information on the study area roadway facilities.

and compared to fall 2009 data collected for the Transportation Impact Analysis – Carolina
North (December 2009 Update) by Vanesse, Hughes, and Brustlin (VHB). Figure 3 shows the
existing lane configuration, traffic control, and speed limits for these study area roadways.
Detailed descriptions of several of the major study area roadways are as follows:

       N.C. Highway 86 (Martin Luther King Jr, Blvd) is a principal arterial in the study area,
        serving areas from I-40 (via Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) to downtown Chapel Hill
        and the US 15-501 corridor to the south. In the study area vicinity, Martin Luther King,
        Jr. Boulevard is a four to six-lane divided cross-section. There are multiple driveway
        access points along the roadway and several major street intersections. No on-street
        parking is permitted along N.C. 86 in the project study area. Several bus stops are
        located along the facility. The posted speed limit is 35 mph in the study area.

       Weaver Dairy Road is a minor arterial that connects areas of east and north Chapel Hill.
        In the study area, Weaver Dairy Road has been widened to a four-lane divided median
        facility with a 35 mph speed limit. The upgrades also include access restrictions for
        private and commercial driveways, sidewalks and bicycle lanes. No on-street parking is
        permitted.

       New Stateside Drive and Stateside Drive are local collector facilities for residential
        development located in the southern portion of the project study area. These facilities
        have two travel lanes with permitted on-street parking and sidewalk on New Stateside
        Drive. Posted speed limits are 25 mph.

       Westminster Drive and Weaver Dairy Road Extension are collector streets that
        provide access to residential neighborhoods along NC 86. Both are two-lane facilities,
        with Weaver Dairy Road Extension having a raised center median. The posted speed
        limit is 25 mph on both facilities. Both feature sidewalk and bicycle lanes. On-street
        parking is permitted in some areas.

The project study area features a mixture of signalized and unsignalized intersections. The
N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) corridor features coordinated signal operation for
weekday peak hours.

Bicycle Routes and Sidewalks
Specific bicycle facilities are present in the immediate study area, with striped bicycle lanes in
both directions along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. Bicycle lanes are also present on
Weaver Dairy Road Extension and Westminster Drive. Pedestrian sidewalk is found along both
sides of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard through the study area. Additional connectivity exists
between these sections and side streets along the corridor. Crosswalks and pedestrian signals
are present across Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at the Weaver Dairy Road intersection.
Crosswalks are also present at the Westminster Drive and Banks Drive intersection in the study
area. Figure 4 displays a schematic of existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the project
study area.

Transit Routes
Current Chapel Hill Transit (CHT) Routes NS and T serve the project study area along Martin
Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, Weaver Dairy Road and Westminster Drive with weekday bus
service (T Route also provides Saturday service). Numerous bus stops, with a range of
amenities (shelters, benches), are present in the study area. Table 3 details the two current
CHT routes serving the study area. Most buses run on 15, 30, or hour headways during
weekday peak service periods.

Triangle Transit provides regional bus service to the immediate study area via the 420 Route
that runs along NC 86 between Chapel Hill and Hillsborough. Service for this route occurs at 30
minute headways during peak weekday periods. Triangle Transit also provides express bus
service from Chapel Hill to Raleigh on the CRX Route that uses NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard) in the study area on 30 minute headways during weekday peak hours

Figure 5 displays transit routes and bus stops that currently exist in the project study area.
Transit trips were not estimated for the Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill site in the following
sections of this report, even though the proximity and frequency of transit service along NC 86
adjacent to the site could account for a measurable portion of site trips, especially employee
trips.

Recommended/Committed Surface Transportation Improvement Projects
There are no committed/programmed NCDOT State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP) projects in the study area that are expected to be complete by 2015. NCDOT is nearing
final completion of the Weaver Dairy Road corridor improvements (STIP U-3306). There is one
approved/committed improvement private development project expected to be complete by the
2015 analysis year in the project study area (Charterwood). Its impacts and proposed
improvements were considered to be complete.

There are numerous additional recommended improvements to transportation facilities in
Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill project study area that may occur as the Carolina North
development progresses to the south of the project study area. However any additional
improvements due to Carolina North were considered post-2015 analysis year for the purposes
of this study.

F. Existing Traffic Conditions

Figures 6A and 6B show the existing AM, noon, and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the study
area intersections. The counts used to determine these volumes were conducted in March
2013 for all study area intersections during the weekday periods 7:00 - 9:00 AM, 11:30 AM –
1:30 PM, and 4:00 – 6:00 PM. Weekday traffic count data for the intersections was compiled by
HNTB to provide updated count information for the entire study area. This data, along with all
turning movement count output is found in Appendix B.

Traffic count information shows traffic flows on N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) were
heavy during the AM and PM peak count periods, with southbound flows into downtown Chapel

Weaver Dairy Road was moderate to heavy during the peak commuting periods. Traffic flows
were light to moderate on the remaining study area roadways that function as collector or local
access streets.

II. 2015 BUILD-OUT YEAR +1 CONDITIONS

A. Future Ambient Area-Wide Traffic Growth Estimation

Based on information on average daily traffic collected by the Town of Chapel Hill and the
NCDOT, a yearly ambient traffic growth rate of 1.50 percent per year was used for the short-
term 2015 design year capacity analyses. This rate is based on previous and anticipated
growth trends for this area from Town and NCDOT average daily traffic information from the
period 1990-2011. Figures 7A and 7B show ambient area-wide growth traffic volume
projections.

It is important to also note that multiple significant background traffic generating developments
were included in this study, and would likely contribute a significant portion of new trips in the
northern Chapel Hill area between 2013 and 2015, if all of these projects were built and
occupied to their approved land use intensities.

B. Approved Background Development Traffic Estimation

Per information from Town of Chapel Hill staff, six Town-approved developments that are either
currently under construction or are expected to be built out and fully operational by the 2015
design analysis year (or soon after) were studied for the inclusion of specific background traffic
for this report. The six developments are listed in Table 5, along with their current status and
impact to 2015 traffic volumes.

Figure 8 shows the relative location of the approved background developments. Total approved
background traffic volumes (corresponding to the 2015 Without Site Traffic Scenario) for the
Children’s’ Campus study area are shown in Figures 9A and 9B. Appendix C displays
individual background traffic generator peak hour volumes estimates projected across the Edge
project study area. Traffic assignment from these six developments was estimated based on
information already compiled for The Edge Mixed-Use Development Traffic Impact Study,
prepared by HNTB in May 2012.

No other proposed/planned development projects were analyzed for specific background traffic
generation impact in the project study area, as several development projects which are currently
active in the Town’s development approval process, or have been approved several years ago
but no activity has commenced, have no certainty of completion by the 2015 analysis year. This
includes both The Edge site and the Town of Chapel Hill Eubanks Park-and-Ride Expansion
project.

C. Proposed Project Traffic

i. Trip Generation

Projected trips for the proposed day care facility were generated based on the ITE Trip
Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 8th Edition, 2008. No adjustments to
trip generation rates (due to internal trips, pass-by trips, transit trips, pedestrian/bicycle trips)
were made due to the nature of the proposed land use. For conservative trip generation
purposes, it was estimated that all site-generated trips would be by private vehicles, since the
majority of peak period trips would be child drop-offs (AM) and pick-ups (PM). Employee trips
might utilize other transportation modes, but were conservatively assumed to be all single
vehicle-based. Trip generation methodologies use the NCDOT recommended practice for this
land use– trip estimates based on facility size (in sqr feet) and rate-based estimation methods.

Table 6 shows the estimated number of vehicular trips generated by Children’s Campus of
Chapel Hill during the weekday AM, noon, and PM peak hours of adjacent streets, based on the
parking generation methodologies and comparisons described above. The table also includes
estimates of daily trip generation for the facility. A peak hour truck percentage of two percent
was estimated for all site-generated traffic.

ii.) Adjustments to Trip Generation Rates

    Raw ITE trip generation estimates for daily and peak hour trips are typically adjusted for the
    following factors to reduce raw trip generation estimates to actual estimated vehicular trips
    produced by the Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill development.

    a.) Internal Capture
    The land use proposed for Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill development would not exhibit
    the potential for internally captured trips for any on-site uses. No additional modifications or
    reductions were made to trip generation results to account for internal capture.

    b.) Modal Split
    Though the study area is well served by several CHT and Triangle Transit fixed bus routes
    with frequent existing service and also has facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists with good
    connectivity to trip attractions in downtown Chapel Hill and the UNC Main Campus, no
    quantitative estimate was made using these modes in comparing to vehicular trips and in
    the assessment of potential improvements needed for the transportation system to support
    these trips.

    c.) Pass-by Trips
    No pass-by trips were accounted for in this study, since the proposed Children’s Campus of
    Chapel Hill is day care facility is not a typical pass-by trip generator. However, the facility
    would produce trips characteristic of a “diverted linked trip”. A diverted linked trip for the
    purposes of this study will be considered to be a “new” trip generated in the study area, but
    would have a both an origination and destination external to the study area. This would
    account for AM peak “drop off” and PM peak “pick up” trips where the trip is made as part of
    a broader “work” trip that may not have necessarily been through the study area. This trip
    type was accounted for in the trip distribution patterns developed for the study.

    d.) Trip Generation Budget
    Current plans for Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill do not specifically designate a phased
    construction process. This analysis considers impacts and recommends improvements for
    the ultimate build-out of Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill, with the proposed development
    intensity as provided by the Applicant.

    e.) Existing Development
    To accurately reflect overall impact of the proposed development, existing trip estimates for
    the current day care facility on-site were made and those numbers subtracted from the raw
    trip generator information in Table 6 to produce overall net trip generation impacts. Existing
    trips were calculated by applying a ratio of 12 existing students to the maximum 192 student
    capacity of the proposed site and then estimating the trips “produced” by those 12 students.

iii.) Trip Distribution

Trip distribution for site-related traffic was based existing daily and peak hour traffic patterns to
determine the directional peak hour characteristics of traffic to and from the site from the major
study area thoroughfares. The nature of trips to/from a day care center also involves the need
to investigate the potential for “diverted linked trips”. These trips would involve a work commute
trip, for example, that would include a stop at the day care facility to drop off or pick up a child.
These may or may not be “new” trips from their overall origin and destination, but were
considered to be “new” trips into/out of the project study area. To account for these trips, trip
distribution percentages entering and exiting the network do not balance in the AM and PM
peak hours, and assume that a majority of the diverted linked trips would be “inbound” to
downtown Chapel Hill/UNC Main Campus area via NC 86. The reverse trip pattern was
assumed in the PM peak hour. Balanced inbound/outbound trip distribution estimates were
assumed for the noon peak hour.

No local trips to/from several lower volume collector and residential streets were estimated,
though the possibility exists a small portion of trip-making may occur to/from these local streets.
It was assumed that trips eastbound on Weaver Dairy Road into the study area would use NC
86 to access the site, though the possibility exists that some trips may divert through the

percentages for the proposed site in 2015.

iv.) Trip Assignment

Figures 12A and 12B show the corresponding site traffic volumes distributed on the 2015 study
area network. Total volumes into and out of the site correspond to total external vehicular trips
generated, based on the trip generation methodology developed previously.

D. Future Traffic Forecasts with the Proposed Development

Figures 13A and 13B display the 2015 Build-out+1 year projected study area traffic volumes
with site traffic added. These traffic volumes represent the aggregate traffic growth over
existing traffic volumes for a) ambient traffic growth, b) specific background development traffic
assignments from those developments, and c) estimated site traffic assignments for Children’s
Campus of Chapel Hill – minus existing trip generation estimates for the current day care site
driveway. This adjustment allows an accurate account of new “net” site traffic impact.


III. IMPACT ANALYSES

A. Peak Hour Intersection Level of Service Analysis

i.) Methodology

Evaluation of traffic operations on suburban arterials is most effective through the determination
of level of service (LOS) criteria. The concept of level of service correlates qualitative aspects
of traffic flow to quantitative terms. This enables transportation professionals to take the
qualitative issues, such as congestion and substandard geometrics, and translate them into
measurable quantities, such as operating speeds and vehicular delays. The 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM 2000) characterizes level of service by letter designations A through F.
Level of service A represents ideal low-volume traffic operations, and level of service F
represents over-saturated high-volume traffic operations. Level of service is measured
differently for various roadway facilities, but in general, level of service letter designations are
described by the following in Table 8.

The Synchro Professional Version 7 operations analysis software was used to analyze peak
hour conditions at signalized intersections. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS+ Version
6.0) was used to analyze peak hour conditions at unsignalized intersections. The minimum
acceptable peak hour intersection level of service established for this project is LOS D for
signalized intersections or LOS E for critical movements at unsignalized intersections, or no
increase in delay for signalized intersections operating below LOS D or unsignalized
intersection critical movements operating below LOS E without the inclusion of site traffic. The
following four conditions were evaluated:

Condition 1    - Existing Traffic
Condition 2    - 2015 Traffic without Site Traffic
Condition 3    - 2015 Traffic with Site Traffic Volumes Added
Condition 4    - 2015 Traffic with Site Traffic and Improvements

The results of this analysis are based on the procedures presented in the HCM 2000 and
performed with the corresponding capacity analysis software described previously. The
methodology of evaluating each condition for signalized intersections is presented below:

       Condition 1 – Use current Town of Chapel Hill data for the cycle length, splits and
        offsets of individual signalized intersections and report LOS and delay values from
        Synchro.

       Conditions 2 and 3 – Reoptimize the cycle lengths and splits of individual intersections
        in Synchro, if existing timing data does not provide adequate overall intersection LOS.
        Adjust cycle lengths, splits, and offsets, if necessary, if the signal is currently operating in
        a coordinated system. The optimized signal timing information will be held constant for
        both Conditions, to provide a means to compare effects of the proposed site traffic. No
        changes to free run traffic signal inputs were made for Conditions 2 and 3. For several
        intersections that will experience capacity improvements, individual intersection retiming
        and offsets were implemented.

                                   Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill – Proposed Day Care Center

       Condition 4 – Optimize coordinated traffic signals for effects of recommended
        mitigation strategies that change existing/committed changes to lane geometrics.
        Evaluate the potential for different signal phasing schemes (left-turn lag phases, for
        example).     Retain existing split minimums and any pedestrian timing values.
        Recommendations, if warranted, will be made to obtain at least LOS D for the
        intersection as a whole.

The net effect of this process is that direct comparisons, by movement, of delay and LOS
between each of the three conditions are impossible because splits and cycle lengths can and
do change between conditions. The pertinent statistic of this analysis is the overall intersection
level of service and delay. Improvements to deficient intersections in Condition 3 were made by
first attempting to adjust signal operations via changes in cycle lengths, splits and/or with
acceptable adjustments to signal phasing. If that did not produce satisfactory results for all
intersections, geometric improvements to improve intersection capacity were considered for the
deficient intersections. Appendix D contains the Synchro output for all four conditions (where
applicable).

Unsignalized intersections were analyzed directly in HCS. Their results were evaluated on a
per-movement basis, since HCS does not produce an overall intersection level of service for
unsignalized intersections. Thus, intersections with deficient (LOS F) movements in Condition 2
would need to be evaluated for improvements in Condition 3. This methodology differs from
signalized intersections, where one or more movements at an intersection may be deficient in
Condition 2, but as long as the overall intersection level of service does not fall below LOS D, no
intersection improvements are deemed necessary. Appendix E contains the HCS output for all
unsignalized intersections under study.

ii.) Existing Conditions Results

Table 9 presents the results for the existing year traffic conditions as compiled from field data.
The table lists LOS and delay values for those movements that are in existence at this time. It
also only lists data for individual movements encountering delay at the stop-controlled
intersections (which do not have an overall intersection delay value produced by HCS).

Currently, all study area signalized intersections operate at acceptable levels of service for all of
the analyzed 2013 peak hours. Several signalized intersection movements are over capacity in
at least one peak hour during existing conditions. However, overall intersection delays and LOS
are not significantly impacted by these movements, which may have relatively low traffic
volumes.

During Condition 2 - 2015 Without Site Traffic, all study area intersections are expected to still
operate at acceptable levels of service for all analyzed peak hours, though some areas in the
project study area will experience relatively significant traffic growth due to the construction of
background traffic developments. The intersection of NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) and
Westminster Drive is expected to be upgraded to a four-legged intersection with the completion
of the Charterwood development. All assumptions for improvements related to that project were
taken from the Traffic Impact Study for the Charterwood development and applied to Condition
2. There are no other committed background improvement projects in the project study area that
are expected to be complete by 2015.

iv.) 2015 Build Scenario (Condition 3) Results

Table 11 presents results for 2015 Build-out+1 year estimated traffic conditions, including
impacts of site-related traffic. In general, the addition of site-related traffic will marginally
increase delays at intersections and is not expected to cause additional intersections or critical
intersection stop-controlled movements to drop to deficient levels in the 2015 analysis year.

                                   Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill – Proposed Day Care Center


Primary impacts of site-related traffic will be experienced at the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr.
Blvd) and Westminster Drive intersection. This intersection will still operate at acceptable LOS
for all three peak hours in 2015, though it will be necessary to potentially retime the intersection
to reduce queues on the side street approaches. Additional recommended details for
intersection improvements at this location are contained in Section IV.D but were not
specifically analyzed separately in Condition 4.

B. Access Analysis

Vehicular site access is to be accommodated with a single full movement access driveway
connecting to Westminster Drive about 300 feet to the east of its signalized intersection with NC
86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd). The driveway is shown to have single inbound and outbound
lanes. A defined driveway access system internal to the site is also shown on the concept plan,
showing internal connectivity to surface parking areas, the lower floor covered parking area, and
drop-off locations.

The proposed access concept would provide about 50 feet of driveway throat length, which is
adequate for anticipated driveway queues in the 2015 peak analysis hours, even with the
assumption that the driveway will only feature a single shared exit lane. Based on a single
egress lane for the site driveway, the minimum storage distances was estimated to be 25-50
feet, representing a maximum capacity analysis software result of two or less queued vehicles
(PM peak hour).

Driveway distance along Westminster Drive from the signalized intersection at NC 86 (Martin
Luther King, Jr. Blvd) is approximately 300 feet and is acceptable, based on recommendations
of 100 foot minimum corner clearance as set forth in the 2003 NCDOT Policy on Street and
Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways and the 100 foot minimum along collector streets
specified in the 2005 Town of Chapel Hill Design Manual.

Access for pedestrians and bicyclists is excellent in the project study area. Sidewalk is present
on both sides of N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) throughout the study area and
connectivity is available on at least one side of the street along many facilities in the project
study area that connect to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. Crosswalk exists across the
NC 86 and Weaver Dairy Road signalized intersections and at Westminster Drive and Banks
Drive near the Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill site. The recommended improvements
included in the Charterwood development traffic study also include the upgrade for full
pedestrian crosswalk and pedestrian signals at the NC 86 and Westminster Drive intersection
adjacent to the site. Striped bicycle lanes along NC 86, Weaver Dairy Road, Westminster Drive
and the Weaver Dairy Road Extension currently exist in the project study area. No specific
details are shown on Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill concept plans regarding external
improvements for pedestrian or bicycle access to/from the site.

C. Signal Warrant Analysis

Based on projected 2015 traffic volumes and current/proposed access plans, the only
unsignalized intersection in the project study area that would potentially warrant the installation
of a traffic signal, based on the methodology found in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD) is at NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) and Stateside Drive.

                                  Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill – Proposed Day Care Center

Though no peak hour capacity analysis result indicated LOS E or F conditions requiring
mitigation in any of the analysis scenarios, this intersection has full access to NC 86 and was
analyzed using the MUTCD methodology. The Peak Hour signal warrant analysis is used as a
verification that projected traffic volumes meet peak hour warrants as a precursor to a more
extensive analysis of conditions via additional data collection for 4-Hour and 8-Hour warrant
analyses.

Based on results from the HCS Signal Warrants software application, this intersection would not
satisfy the Peak Hour Warrants in any peak hour in the 2015 with site traffic scenario. Appendix
F contains details for the Peak Hour Warrant analysis.

D. Sight Distance Analysis

In general, sight distance issues entering/exiting the proposed Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill
site would be minimal, considering the fact that Westminster Drive has no horizontal curvature
in the vicinity of the proposed project and vertical curvature is currently minimal.

E. Crash Analysis

Data from the NCDOT Traffic Safety Unit was requested and was provided for the period
3/1/2010 to 2/28/2013 for the segment of N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) from the Weaver
Dairy Road intersection to Stateside Drive. Additionally, information was provided for crashes at
all study area intersections for this time period. Raw crash data can be found in Appendix G.

N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr, Boulevard) Corridor
There were 20 crashes reported along the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard study area corridor
between Weaver Dairy Road and Stateside Drive over the three year period. In this 0.63 mile
segment, crash types were primarily angle crashes and rear end crashes, along with several
other crash types. Seven of the 20 crashes were rear-end type crashes. Other significant crash
types included angle crashes (4), and bicyclist crashes (2).

Table 12 presents a comparison between the N.C 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) study
area crash rates and the latest North Carolina statewide rates for the period 2008-2010
(compiled by NCDOT Traffic Safety Unit). Overall, the number of crashes along Martin Luther
King, Jr. Boulevard in the project study area is lower than statewide averages for similar
facilities in every reported category. The crash severity (number of fatal and injury crashes) is
slightly lower than statewide averages.

  Westminster Drive and Banks Drive                    1                    182.48

Crash rate information taken from the crash reports indicates that the two intersections along
Banks Drive have the highest rate of crashes, but this indicator is not necessarily a meaningful
comparison, since traffic volumes at these intersections are relatively low. Thus, a single crash
may skew the rate to a high overall number. In the case of Weaver Dairy Road and Banks
Drive, the intersection now has a median which restricts access for left-turn movements and will
likely significantly reduce crash rates.

The NC 86 (Martin Luther King Jr.) intersection at Weaver Dairy Road has the highest rate of
crashes along the NC 86 thoroughfare. Typically, congested conditions during peak travel
periods are a cause of higher crash rates and this intersection experiences more congestion
than the other study area intersections, where minor street traffic volumes are lighter. The
recently constructed improvements to the intersection should have a positive effect on
decreasing congestion and lowering the crash rate.

F. Other Transportation-Related Analyses

Other transportation-related analyses relevant to the 2001 Town of Chapel Hill Guidelines for
the preparation of Traffic Impact Studies were completed as appropriate. The following topics
listed in Table 14 are germane to the scope of this study.

G. Special Analysis/Issues Related to Project

Based on discussions with Town of Chapel Hill staff, there are no special issues or analyses
beyond the ones already discussed for this proposed site.

                      thoroughfares and into several neighborhoods/commercial areas. Bicycle lanes
                      extend along NC 86 through the study area, as well as on Westminster Drive

IV. MITIGATION MEASURES/RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Planned Improvements

There are no Town of Chapel Hill or North Carolina Department of Transportation improvement
projects for study area facilities within the analysis year time frame of 2013-2015.

B. Background Committed Improvements

There is one specific private development project (Charterwood) that has been approved and is
expected to be complete by the 2015 analysis year that would impact project study area
transportation facilities. The proposed site plan information for Charterwood and corresponding
Charterwood Traffic Impact Study, completed by HNTB in April 2011 included the addition of
three site driveways along NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd), one of which would form the
fourth (western) leg of the existing NC 86 intersection with Westminster Drive. This intersection
would also be modified for the following recommended improvements from that study (see
Figure 14 for schematic details):

       Construction of a northbound left-turn storage lane in the existing NC 86 median at the
        Westminster Drive intersection with 200 feet of vehicle storage;


April 2013                                      19
                                              Town of Chapel Hill: Draft Traffic Impact Study
                                   Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill – Proposed Day Care Center


       Construction of a southbound right-turn deceleration/storage lane at this intersection with
        125 feet of vehicular storage;
       Provision of a single ingress and two egress lanes eastbound at the Charterwood Main
        Site Driveway. The two egress lanes are to provide at least 100 feet of vehicle storage
        throat length and were analyzed as a shared left-turn/through lane and right-turn lane;
       The existing westbound Westminster Drive single lane approach would be restriped for a
        shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane;
       The existing signal control at NC 86 and Westminster Drive would be upgraded and
        retimed. Protected left-turn phasing (or protected+permitted left-turn phasing) would be
        added for northbound and southbound left-turn movements).
       Pedestrian cross-walks and pedestrian signal heads would be constructed across all
        intersection legs
       A bus bay and bus stop along southbound NC 86 would be constructed just south of
        Westminster Drive

In addition to these recommended improvements, the Charterwood Traffic Impact Study also
recommended that additional monitoring of the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) and
Stateside Drive intersection be done to verify if the intersection met comprehensive MUTCD
signal warrants for installation of a traffic signal at that location.

C. Applicant Committed Improvements

Based on the preliminary site plan and supporting development information provided, there are
no specific transportation-related improvements shown external to the site property.

D. Necessary Improvements

Based on traffic capacity analyses for the 2015 design year, and analyses of existing study area
turning bay storage lengths and site access, the following improvements are recommended as
being necessary for adequate transportation network operations (see Figure 14).

    1) Retime the upgraded NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) and Westminster
       Drive/Charterwood Driveway intersection to consider “half cycling” the intersection to
       reduce projected vehicle queues on the westbound Westminster Drive approach.
       Additional site-related traffic may cause vehicle queuing on Westminster Drive at this
       approach that may block the proposed Children’s Campus site driveway if the existing
       150 and 180 second AM and PM peak hour cycle lengths along NC 86 are maintained at
       this intersection. A shorter cycle length will reduce side street queues while still allowing
       main street progression along NC 86 and adequate overall LOS at the intersection. This
       improvement is recommended if the Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill site is developed.

If the Charterwood development does not move forward, the recommendation made above will
still apply, as would the proposed improvements to add pedestrian crosswalks and pedestrian
signal heads to the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive) intersection with Westminster Drive, as
well as a bus bay southbound on NC 86 just south of Westminster Drive.

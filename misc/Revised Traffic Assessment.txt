Introduction

This report summarizes an assessment of traffic circulation adjacent to the Marco Island
Marriott Resort hotel in support of a proposed redevelopment. From a traffic-generating
perspective, the redevelopment proposes an increase of 84 net new rooms, bringing the total
number of rooms to 810 as allowed for in the original 2001 PUD approval, and a new 134-
seat rooftop restaurant.        In addition, meeting room space will be increased by
approximately 26,200 net square feet. The study, prepared by Tindale-Oliver and
Associates, Inc., (TOA), considers:
    vehicular traffic circulation,
    pedestrian movements across South Collier Boulevard (between the hotel and
       parking facilities), and
    traffic safety and crash patterns, and
    access to the meeting room loading facility.

The hotel is located on the west side of South Collier Boulevard, approximately ¼ mile
south of its intersection with San Marco Road, in the City of Marco Island, as shown in
Figure 1. A proposed site plan is provided in Figure 2. Parking for the hotel is provided on
the east side of South Collier Boulevard.

This traffic analysis was performed to update to current traffic conditions, addressing the
requirements of the City’s Land Development Code Chapter 30, Article X – Concurrency
Management, as well as safety and pedestrian and bicycle circulation. Prior to beginning
the analysis, correspondence and discussions were held with City of Marco Island staff to
identify key traffic issues and study methodology. Correspondence summarizing the
methodology discussions is provided in Appendix A of this report. The resulting traffic
analysis was generally carried out as follows:

             Traffic volumes generated by the proposed land uses were estimated using nationally-published
              trip generation rates, and compared with data collected on December 20, 2013;
             Project traffic was distributed and assigned to the vicinity street system;

             The section of South Collier Boulevard, and its intersections at San Marco Road, at Winterberry
              Drive, and at hotel site driveways;
             2013 existing PM peak hour traffic volumes in the project vicinity were collected and adjusted to
              reflect 2013 peak season conditions;

             Pedestrian volumes and bicycle volumes along South Collier Boulevard, and usage of crosswalks
              crossing South Collier Boulevard were observed on a Friday and Saturday in December, 2013.
             Detailed intersection and roadway level of service analysis of the study network was completed
              using Highway Capacity Manual methods.
             Historical crash data for this section of South Collier Boulevard was compiled and reviewed for
              unusual crash occurrence.




Trip Generation

Daily and PM peak hour traffic volumes generated by the proposed project were estimated
based on data published in Trip Generation (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 9th
edition, 2012). The resulting trip generation estimates are summarized in Table 1.

         So urce: ITE Trip Generatio n, 9th Editio n, 2012.




As shown in Table 1, upon completion of the redevelopment, the proposed project is
estimated to generate 76 gross new trip ends (43 inbound, 33 outbound) during the PM
peak hour of adjacent street traffic. After consideration of internal capture (a moderate
assumption that only 25 percent of the restaurant trips would come from within the hotel)
and pass-by trip capture (44 percent, per ITE), a net new external traffic generation of 55
trips (32 trips inbound and 23 outbound) is estimated.

The ITE trip rates for the resort hotel were compared with the trip generation observed on
the day the peak hour traffic counts were undertaken (Friday, December 20th), when 394
rooms were occupied. The peak hour trip rate observed on December 20, 2013, which would
take into consideration all uses on the site (e.g. restaurants, spa, meetings) was 0.69 trip-
ends per occupied room. If the 84-room net increase were viewed as a (84/394=) 21.3
percent increase in hotel size, the potential increase in traffic would be (394 * 0.69 * 0.213=)
58 trip-ends. This value compares favorably with the ITE-based estimate of 55 trip-ends, so



Tindale-Oliver and Associates, Inc.                                                          4                          Marco Island Marriott Resort Hotel

we are comfortable that a 55 trip-end increase during the p.m. peak hour is a reasonable
estimate.

For the peak hour directional split, the ITE estimate above indicates a heavier inbound
trend (58 percent), but this trend is influenced by the new restaurant. Per ITE, the hotel
rooms themselves have a 50:50 directional split. The observed directional split was 60
percent outbound, 40 percent inbound, but is likely influenced by employees leaving the
site. The traffic added to the road network for this analysis includes unoccupied, but
already built hotel room traffic (see further discussion of this issue below), and a 50:50
directional split was applied to all of the added hotel traffic to reflect the predominantly
hotel room-generated traffic.

Trip Distribution and Assignment

The distribution of project site traffic was estimated based on the site driveway peak hour
turning movement counts. These counts indicate that 75% of the traffic generated by the
existing hotel arrives from and departs to the north, and 25% from and to the south.
Redevelopment-generated traffic was then manually assigned to the vicinity roadway
network based on this trip distribution, but taking into consideration the ease of turns and
porte-cochere versus the east parking destination. Figure 5 illustrates the assignment of
project-generated traffic, and supporting worksheets are provided in Appendix B. Hotel
traffic was assigned in consideration of the December 20, 2013 driveway volume
observations, the observed traffic volumes at the two adjacent intersections, with
adjustments to reflect hotel guests not being as familiar with Marco Island as residents
might be.



Traffic Operational Analysis

For this analysis, the intersections of South Collier Boulevard at San Marco Road and at
Winterberry Drive, and the three site driveways, were counted during the p.m. peak hour
on December 20, 2013. These counts were factored to estimate 2013 100th highest hour
volumes using seasonal adjustment factors from the Florida DOT developed for Marco
Island (provided in Appendix C), and the volumes are reported in Figure 3.

To these volumes, traffic associated with unoccupied hotel rooms was added. When the
intersection turning movement counts were undertaken on December 20, 2013, 394 hotel
rooms were occupied. For purposes of this traffic study, an 85 percent hotel occupancy was
established as an 80th percentile “design” condition, so additional traffic for the
unaddressed(810*0.85 – 394 =) 295 rooms was added. 71 of these rooms represent 85
percent of the 84 new rooms, and 224 of these rooms represent the rooms “missing” from
the background traffic. These volumes are reported separately in

 Figure 4, which provides the design traffic volumes used for the analysis. Finally, Figure 5
provides the traffic volumes associated with the redevelopment project and the total
volumes used for the analysis.

2000 Highway Capacity Manual procedures, as provided for in the Synchro 8 software was
applied to the signalized and unsignalized intersection locations. The results of the
analysis are summarized in Table 2, below, and the capacity analysis worksheets are
provided in Appendix D.

Concurrency is not an issue here, as the analysis indicates that level of service B conditions
or better will be preserved for all movements on South Collier Boulevard (where the
standard is “D”), meeting the level of service standards adopted by the City in its
Comprehensive Plan. One movement, not on the level of service regulated road, the exiting
left-turn movement from the south porte-cochere driveway, is estimated to incur level of
service E conditions, with 29.7 seconds of average delay, under the “design” traffic loading.
The capacity analysis worksheet indicates the 95th percentile queue would extend only
three vehicles at that location.

Pedestrian Observations

The section of South Collier Boulevard from the hotel loading dock area to the Madeira
residential tower driveway and crosswalk were observed for two days, Friday December 20
and Saturday December 21. Pedestrian and bicycle volumes by time of day and compliance
with the existing crosswalks was observed. These observations included movements along
South Collier Boulevard as well as movements crossing South Collier Boulevard.

The pedestrian counts are provided in Appendix C, and a sample of 1,881 crossing
pedestrians were observed in one 12-hour period. The most heavily used crosswalk is the
southern porte-cochere crosswalk, used by parking valets, and the lightest was the
southernmost crosswalk, south of the service vehicle entrance. We observed that 81
percent of the pedestrians crossing South Collier Boulevard crossed within the crosswalks.
The areas with the greatest amount of non-compliance are between the north porte-cochere
and the spa crosswalks. The renovation plan proposes combining two crosswalk locations
(counting from the south, the second and third ones) to a location centered on the porte-
cochere. This location will serve valets (who can be directed to use either the first or this
crosswalk) and pedestrians generated at the main hotel entrance and south room tower.

Marriott has agreed to make 30 parking spaces available in their east-side parking area
available for public use to support the public beach to the northwest. A pedestrian crossing
exists, approximately 275 feet north of the Hotel/Spa Driveway that will serve pedestrians
walking between the beach and these parking spaces, but its appearance and lighting is not
consistent with the other three crosswalks serving the Hotel frontage. A consistent
crosswalk “theme” will improve driver recognition of all the crosswalks in the area and

it more similar to the crosswalks to the south is recommended.



Crash Analysis

Crash records maintained by Collier County were accessed for the road segment from the
hotel’s truck loading docks to the Madeira residential tower. This data is summarized in
Table 3 and illustrated in Figure 6. Individual crash reports are provided in Appendix E.
The recorded crash history included 16 reported crashes along South Collier Boulevard, and
two in the Marco Island Marriott parking lots, from January, 2005, through November,
2013. The crash rate (number of crashes per million vehicle-miles of travel) is below
average (safer) for similar roads in Florida and in the Florida DOT’s District 1.

A downward trend in the number of reported crashes per year is seen, an average of five
per year in 2005-2006, 1.5 per year in 2007-2010, and none after 2010. Several of the
crashes were noted as occurring while South Collier Boulevard was under reconstruction in
2005. One crash injuring a pedestrian bystander on the sidewalk occurred in 2009 and one
crash involving a bicycle striking an automobile occurred in 2005, during reconstruction.
The majority of crashes occur in the southbound direction of travel. “Rear-end” crashes
involving vehicles stopping for pedestrians being hit from the rear by other vehicles were
the most prevalent single pattern, so there is evidence that drivers are willing to stop for
pedestrians crossing South Collier Boulevard. While safety is always a concern for the City
and the hotel operator, the eight-year average crash rate is at or below state averages, and
the recent history is well below state averages. Thus, the safety data does not indicate
abnormal crash rates that would demand additional safety treatments.

Truck Loading Dock Considerations

The design of the hotel’s service vehicle dock area was an issue of concern to the City.
Currently, on occasion, trucks entering the docks apparently must stop on South Collier
Boulevard, or otherwise temporarily block the southbound lanes on South Collier
Boulevard, requiring other motorists to stop or change lanes to avoid the obstruction. In
addition, concern has been voiced by the City regarding the aesthetics of the existing
loading area being visible from South Collier Boulevard. Design goals were set that trucks
must be able to enter the loading docks without encroaching into South Collier Boulevard,
and the ability to access the site from the right-hand lane on South Collier Boulevard
without stopping and/or blocking traffic on South Collier Boulevard. The physical size of
the trucks and their turning paths and the physical constraints of the existing structure
also affected the ability to achieve these goals.

The loading dock configuration arrived at is illustrated in Figure 7, which achieves the first
goal, and puts the second goal in reach. The figure indicates the “swept path” of trucks as
they enter the site, back into a loading dock, and then exit the site to the south, and to the
north.

Features of the design solution include use of an ornamental fence and gate for screening
the loading dock area from South Collier Boulevard. The fence would remain closed most of
the time, but it would have to be opened when service vehicles need to enter or exit the site.
Some short duration of traffic blockage on South Collier Boulevard might occur while
trucks wait for the gate to open. The fence would also provide a more secure loading area
for the hotel and more clearly define areas and times where pedestrians and bicyclists along
South Collier Boulevard need to be more attentive to the possibility of traffic entering and
exiting the site.

The hotel is able to manage the arrival times and service times of some of the service
vehicles, but some vehicles are not within the hotel’s control, so the management of service
vehicles and provision of an adequate number of loading docks is an important element of
good loading dock operation. Based on truck access information provided by the hotel staff,
and application of mathematical models, the probability of there being more than four
trucks on-site at one time during a 10-hour “service” period is 6.5 percent, and if a fifth
truck arrives, one additional storage/staging area is available along the south edge of the
site. A worksheet providing the assumptions and documenting the calculations of the
probability above is provided in Appendix F.

During the methodology discussions, City staff advised the developer that the Smokehouse
Bay Bridge, located on North Collier Boulevard between the hotel and the Bald Eagle Drive
intersection, would be reconstructed while the redevelopment construction is likely to be in
progress. During the bridge reconstruction, only one lane of traffic will be retained open, a
situation that will be difficult for large vehicles to negotiate. Alternate routes for
construction-related traffic would include Bald Eagle Drive or Barfield Drive and San
Marco Road, or from US 41 via CR 92/San Marco Road.

Initial considerations indicate that the route via Bald Eagle Drive would expose the fewest
number of homes to the construction traffic, and would provide the least amount of out-of-
direction travel for the re-routed traffic.



Conclusion

This review of traffic issues has focused on an 85 percent occupancy level for traffic
operational issues. The traffic review has indicated that favorable treatments are being
provided to the issues identified as of concern to the City of Marco Island, as follows:

             Roadway operations will be maintained at better-than adopted standards.
             Pedestrians exhibit a reasonable level of compliance with the crosswalk scheme, and
              crash records show no pedestrian-related crashes.
             Crash rates on South Collier Boulevard are at or below average, which is good;
              however patterns of southbound and rear-end crashes are prevalent.
             An improved design of the truck/loading dock area has been proposed for more
              efficient and operations that are less disruptive to the community.

  Re:    Traffic Study Methodology
         Marco Island Marriott Redevelopment

  Dear Mr. Pinter:

  This letter summarizes our proposed traffic study assumptions and methodology for the
  redevelopment of the Marco Island Marriott hotel. We understand the redevelopment will
  include development of approximately 72 additional hotel rooms, 26,1876 additional square
  feet of meeting/ballroom space, and 5,000 square feet of spa facility. The development
  location is illustrated in Figure 1, and is located on the west side of South Collier
  Boulevard, approximately one-half mile south of San Marco Road. Parking for the site is
  located on both the east and west sides of South Collier Boulevard, and access is provided
  via five direct connection driveways to South Collier Boulevard. This analysis is being
  prepared to support the Planned Unit Development (PUD) amendment application,
  addressing site access provisions for vehicles and pedestrians, and nearby intersection
  operating conditions. A preliminary conceptual site plan is provided in Figure 2.

  We propose to evaluate vehicular traffic for the p.m. peak period (late afternoon), per the
  City’s Comprehensive Plan Capital Improvements Element (page VIII-88). Trip generation
  for the hotel will be based on both ITE’s Trip Generation (9th Edition, 2012) reference, land
  use code 330, Resort Hotel. This land use is described in Trip Generation as providing
  “sleeping accommodations, restaurants, cocktail lounges, retail shops and guest services”
  and that they “cater to the tourist and vacation industry, often providing a wide variety of
  recreational facilities/programs (golf courses, tennis courts, beach access, or other
  amenities) rather than convention and meeting business. Resort hotels are normally
  located in … outlying locations on larger sites than conventional hotels.” The trip
  generation rates published in Trip Generation will be compared to rates observed at the
  hotel during December, 2013, and if substantially different, we will discuss potential causes
  and propose a “design” traffic estimate.

  Based on our December 18, 2013 conversation, we agreed the extent of the road network to
  be studied will include the intersection of South Collier Boulevard at Winterberry Drive,
  site frontage, and the intersection of South Collier Boulevard with San Marco Road.

  Project generated traffic distribution will be estimated based on the traffic counts
  undertaken at site driveways. If there is a need to include traffic from any other area
  developments, we will estimate these volumes based on information to be provided by City
  staff. Please provide a summary of approved developments (name, location, approved
  quantities of development, amount already developed), if any, that need to be incorporated
  into the traffic analysis in your confirmation of this letter. Since Marco Island is an
  “isolated” community, no other “background” or “regional” traffic growth will be
  incorporated into the study, future total traffic volumes will be the recorded traffic volumes,
  adjusted to 100th highest hour estimates (based on Collier County quarterly traffic counts
  conducted at nearby locations) plus traffic associated with the renovated land uses.

  We will analyze intersection and arterial levels of service at the study intersections, and the
  roadway segments between them, for the following conditions: 2013 existing, and 2013 plus
  project. Based on the analysis results, we will identify improvements, if any, required to
  meet adopted level of service standards and to provide good site access operations. The
  Synchro 8 software package, 2000 HCM methodology, will be used for the intersection and
  arterial analysis.

  In addition, we will observe activity of pedestrians and bicyclists travelling along and
  crossing South Collier Boulevard (one Friday and one Saturday, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.)
  – the volumes of traffic and time of day in each crosswalk -- and review five years of traffic
  accident data. We will also review the current pedestrian crossing provisions at the four
  crossings along the hotel frontage, plus a fifth location at the Madeira development
  driveway, and make recommendations if the need for changes to current provisions emerge.

  Finally, using information provided by our client regarding frequency and duration of truck
  deliveries, we will evaluate provisions for service vehicles accessing the site at loading
  docks as a part of our report.

  In addition, in our December 18th telephone conversation, you also noted that the
  Smokehouse Bay Bridge would go under construction in April or May, 2014, for a period of
  approximately 20 months, and during that time there may be weight restrictions placed on
  bridge traffic that might affect Marriott Hotel construction-related traffic. Since we are not

  certain if the construction schedules will overlap, we will not address this issue as a part of
  the traffic review to be undertaken and submitted over the next several weeks; however we
  wanted to acknowledge in this letter that you had raised the potential concern.

  The analysis will be documented in a summary report with supporting illustrations and
  worksheets documenting the analyes undertaken.

  If you have any questions or comments, or if you would like to discuss modification to the
  proposed methodology, please feel free to give me a call. We would appreciate written
  confirmation of your approval (via letter or email) of the proposed methodology, as well as
  input on the other developments to include in background traffic. We look forward to
  working with you on this project.

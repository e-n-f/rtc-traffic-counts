                                           Rezone Application Narrative



DR Horton, Inc., (Applicant) is preparing a rezoning application and related development concept plan (DCP) for
approximately 35.25 acres + known as Bellagio. Bellagio includes two (2) parcels generally referred to as
North/South Bellagio Boulevard Parcels with property identification numbers 0470-11-0001 and 0470-14-0002. The
properties are currently owned by the Diocese of Venice; however, are under contract (sales agreement) to the
Applicant.

The properties are currently designated on the adopted Sarasota County Future Land Use Map as OFF/MF
(Office/Multi-family Residential) and are also located within the SR 776 Corridor Plan. The Applicant is proposing to
rezone the parcels from OUE-2 to a Comprehensive Plan compliant zoning of RSF-4 PUD and develop a single
family residential community totaling approximately 110 dwelling units and related amenities; commercial and office
uses are not proposed or requested as part of the rezoning request. As illustrated on the Binding Development
Concept Plan (DCP), there are 39 lots in the South Bellagio parcel including the required community focal point
(optional amenity area) with the remaining 71 lots located in the North Bellagio parcel including a second community
focal point (optional amenity center).

As previously noted, Bellagio includes residential uses, related amenities and open space elements. Although the
RSF-4 zoning permits up to 5.5 dwelling units per acre (du/ac), the Applicant does not propose to develop to that
density. Based on the proposed 110 dwelling units, the requested density for the community is 3.15 du/ac which is
consistent with and compatible with the adjacent (surrounding) developed residential communities to the west, south
and east. By comparison, the adopted Comprehensive Plan designation of OFF/MF provides for (allows) mixed use
developments with increased residential densities than proposed by the Applicant and also allows for non-residential
uses.

Per the Comprehensive Plan, “The Future Land Use Map recognizes existing areas that include office and multi-
family residential uses, and to provides additional areas where such uses can be developed. Such mixed use areas
may be appropriate at select locations at interstate interchanges, in proximity to major employment centers and along
existing arterial roadways where parcels are deep enough to accommodate development and be integrated into
existing neighborhoods. In some locations, this designation may provide a good transition between existing
neighborhoods and arterial roadways. Allowing the mix of uses increases the efficiency of land and infrastructure and
may assist to capture internal traffic counts. In other areas, other less intense residential development may continue
to be appropriate.

The uses allowed within this designation (OFF/MF) include office, multi-family residential, public and civic uses, and
combinations of those uses. The Office/Multi Family Residential designation is implemented though the following
zoning districts: Office, Professional and Institutional (OPI) and medium and high density residential uses, such as
RSF-4, and RMF-1, 2, or 3.” The Applicant is requesting the lowest density implementing zoning district for the
project and in addition, is proposing to further reduce the density as noted below. For comparison purposes, the
OFF/MF implementing residential zoning districts permit the following densities:

Zoning District                                             Allowable Density (dwelling units per acre)
RMF-1                                                       6.0
RMF-2                                                       9.0
RMF-3                                                       13.0
RSF-4                                                       5.5
Bellagio                                                    3.15 (requested)
The OFF/MF implementing non-residential zoning districts permit CM and OPI; RMF zoning districts also permit non-
residential uses with certain development standards including building ground coverage of up to 30 percent and
maximum building heights up to 35’ (RMF-1 and -2) and 45’ (RMF-3). In addition, the OPI and CM zoning districts
permit 9.0 du/ac (density by right) with maximum building heights of 35’ (equivalent of three-stories). Bellagio does
not propose or identify on the Binding DCP any office, commercial or similar non-residential uses or multi-family
structures.

Although the properties directly front SR 776, access is proposed to be provided via the existing Bellagio Boulevard
at two existing curb cuts onto Bellagio Boulevard; no direct access to SR 776 or the adjacent residential communities
is proposed. Consistent with the SR 776 Corridor Plan, a 50’ greenway with a 12 easement and 10’ multi-modal trail
is provided along SR 776. In addition and as previously noted, a community focal point is provided as part of the
request and is identified (provided) on the DCP in the South Bellagio parcel. As identified in the field inspections and
illustrated on the aerial map, Bellagio proposes to use two of the three existing driveway locations provided to the
properties along Bellagio Boulevard.

Consistent with Article 7, Section 7.3.8 of the Sarasota County Zoning Regulations, a minimum 15’ buffer width is
required along the property perimeter. Bellagio provides a minimum 15’ buffer with an optional wall along the north
and east boundary; a minimum 20’ buffer is provided along the southern boundary with an optional wall; and as
previously noted, a 50’ greenway along the western boundary (along SR 776) with an optional wall. Based on
comments received during the neighborhood workshop, the number of residential lots adjacent to the neighborhood
to the south (Gulf View Estates) has been minimized; three lots abut the neighborhood along with the community
focal point (optional amenity center) and a larger (elongated) stormwater feature providing an additional
buffer/separation distance between Gulf View Estates and the majority of the residential lots in Bellagio (upwards of
130’). Also along the southern property boundary is a minimum 10’ FP& L utility easement. These features,
including the perimeter landscape buffer (and required opacity standards) will minimize the impacts to adjacent
properties.

One design standard (modification) is proposed as part of this application. The Applicant would request the following
building setbacks: Front Yard = 20’, Side Yard = 5’ (10’ between structures), Rear Yard = 10’ and for corner lots
where there is no driveway and/or garage proposed (i.e., the side of the residential structure), setbacks = 10’.

Pending approval, Bellagio is anticipated to be developed in two phases with anticipated build-out by 2025. The
Applicant intends to provide model homes/sales center as part of the project which would be later converted for
residential sales.

                                      INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to document a transportation concurrency study for the Bellagio
development, a proposed 120 single family dwelling unit development, in accordance with
Sarasota County’s Resolution No. 98-169. This report summarizes the procedures and findings
of this analysis and presents recommendations for transportation approval.


The proposed single family development site is located on the east side of SR 776/Englewood
Road, north and south of Bellagio Boulevard in Sarasota County, Florida. Access to the Bellagio
development will be provided through two unsignalized, full access connections on Bellagio
Boulevard, east of SR 776/Englewood Road. Neither the parcel north or south of Bellagio
Boulevard will contain more than 100 dwelling units. Bellagio Boulevard provides access to SR
776/Englewood Road at an existing full access median opening, with stop-control provided for
the eastbound and westbound movements.

           Prior to undertaking this analysis, a transportation methodology was prepared and
           submitted to Sarasota County staff on July 10, 2014. The methodology is summarized in
           a letter contained in Appendix A of this report, along with correspondence from
           Sarasota County approving the methodology. In general, the following procedural steps
           were undertaken:


           ·   Traffic volumes anticipated to be generated by the proposed development were
               estimated using rates documented in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE)
               Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition;
           ·   Project traffic was distributed and assigned to the public roadway network based
               upon the results of a Florida Standard Urban Transportation Model Structure
               (FSUTMS) Sarasota-Manatee-Charlotte (SMC) analysis;
           ·   The study area network was defined as all segments for which project traffic is
               expected to consume at least 5.0 percent of Sarasota County’s two-way, peak-hour
               level of service (LOS) C service volume for each specific segment;
           ·   Existing p.m. peak-hour traffic volumes in the study area were collected and
               adjusted to reflect peak-season volumes, and were utilized in the development of
               future background conditions;
           ·   Work Programs of Sarasota County and the FDOT were reviewed to identify
               scheduled road improvements in the area;
           ·   Intersection level of service (LOS) analyses within the study area for existing and
               future scenarios were completed using analytical methods defined in the Highway
               Capacity Software (HCS) programs, Sarasota County’s “2012 Generalized Level of
               Service Analysis”, and the Florida Department of Transportation’s “2013
               Quality/Level of Service Handbook.”

                                        PROJECT SITE

Project traffic used in this analysis is defined as the vehicle trips expected to be generated by
the proposed single-family development. These trips were distributed and assigned throughout
the study roadway network.


Proposed Land Uses
The proposed project site is located on the north and south side of Bellagio Boulevard, which is
located on the east side of SR 776/Englewood Road in Sarasota County, Florida. The proposed
site will contain up to 120 single family residences. Project buildout is expected to occur by
2024.


Project Access
Access to the Bellagio development will be provided through the existing full access median
connection of Bellagio Boulevard to SR 776/Englewood Road. Two site access driveways are
proposed on Bellagio Boulevard to serve the site. Neither the parcel north or south of Bellagio
Boulevard will contain more than 100 dwelling units.


Trip Generation
The new trip generation potential of the proposed development for the p.m. peak-hour was
estimated using information contained in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, for land
use code (LUC), 210, Single Family Residential. The estimated total new trips expected to be
generated by the proposed development are 124 two-way, trip-ends (78 entering/46 exiting) in
the p.m. peak hour of adjacent roadways during the 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. time period as listed
below in Table 1.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
New traffic expected to be generated by the proposed development was distributed and
assigned to the adjacent roadway network based upon a FSUTMS analysis. The resulting
percentages were applied to the trip generation estimates shown in Table 1 to estimate project
trips within the vicinity of the project site. The distribution of project traffic, in terms of trip
percentages, is shown in Figure 2. Documentation of the project distribution is provided in
Appendix B.


As shown in Figure 2, approximately 80 percent of project trips are expected to travel to/from
areas north of the project site on SR 776/Englewood Road, approximately 20 percent of project
trips are expected to travel to/from areas south of the project site on SR 776/Englewood Road.

                              SCHEDULED IMPROVEMENTS

A review of the Five Year Work Program for Sarasota County and FDOT District 1 revealed that
there are no roadway capacity projects near the project site that are scheduled for construction
within the next five years (through 2019) near the project site. Based upon this information,
existing lane geometry, traffic controls, and roadway service volumes were used in the analysis
of traffic conditions for the impacted study intersections and roadways.

                                STUDY AREA DETERMINATION

The extent of the roadway network to be studied was based upon Sarasota County’s Resolution
No. 98-169 which states that the study area shall consist of all roadway segments for which
project traffic is expected to consume at least five percent (5%) of Sarasota County’s two-way,
peak-hour LOS C service volume for each specific segment. The results of the study area
determination are shown in Table 2. Based upon the number of new p.m. peak-hour trips
expected to be generated by the proposed development (124 trips), there were no roadway
segments in which the project traffic is projected to consume five percent (5%) or more of the
roadway segments’ respective maximum service volume (commonly referred to as capacity) for
LOS C. Therefore, only the two (2) roadway segments that are adjacent to the project site were
also included in the study area, as listed below:


           ·   Englewood Road/SR 776 from Rutgers Road to Bellagio Boulevard/Project Access
           ·   Englewood Road/SR 776 from Bellagio Boulevard/Project Access to Manasota Beach
               Road


In addition, the two (2) signalized intersections located along those roadway segments were
included as the study intersections. These study intersections are as follows:


           ·   SR 776 & Rutgers Road
           ·   SR 776 & Manasota Beach Road


The unsignalized intersection of SR 776 & Bellagio Boulevard/Project Access was also included
in the analysis, as well as the two proposed project driveways on Bellagio Boulevard.

                           BACKGROUND TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Vehicle turning movement volume counts were obtained by Kimley-Horn at the existing
signalized study intersections, as identified in the previous section of this report, during the
p.m. peak-period (4:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.) to quantify existing p.m. peak-hour conditions in the
study area. Counts were collected on various dates between January 2014 and July 2014. The
raw counts are provided in Appendix C.


The vehicle counts at the study intersections were adjusted to reflect seasonal conditions. This
modification was performed using the FDOT’s most recent (2013) seasonal factors (SF), which
correspond to the data collection dates. These factors are provided in Appendix C and the
existing seasonally adjusted traffic volumes are provided in Appendix D.


Background seasonally adjusted traffic volumes were then grown to the year 2024 (build-out
year) either using the growth rates found in Sarasota County’s document “2012 Generalized
LOS and 2009-2012 Growth Rate with 2018 Volume Projection,” or vested trips provided by
Sarasota County staff. The greater volume of the vested trips or background traffic determined
using growth rates was evaluated on an individual intersection basis, and for no intersections
were the vested trips greater than the traffic determined from background growth rates.
Therefore, all 2024 (build-out year) traffic was determined using background seasonally
adjusted traffic volumes which were grown using the growth rates found in Sarasota County’s
document “2012 Generalized LOS and 2009-2012 Growth Rate with 2018 Volume Projection”.
Documentation is provided in Appendix D.


These growth rates were applied to the 2014 peak season intersection volumes to derive the
2024 future background roadway volumes.

                         BUILD-OUT YEAR TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

Pursuant to the agreed upon study methodology, the intersection analyses were performed for
the existing year (2014) and build-out year (2024) traffic conditions. The build-out year (2024)
traffic conditions were evaluated within the study network for four (4) scenarios – build-out
year background traffic volumes with existing geometric conditions, build-out background
traffic volumes with geometric improvements per House Bill 7207 (HB 7207), build-out year
total (background with project) traffic with geometric improvements per HB 7207, and build-
out year total (background with project) traffic with improvements recommended due to the
project’s impact.


Per Sarasota County Resolution No. 98-169, an overall LOS C is required for signalized
intersections on county roads, with LOS E acceptable for the approaches and lane groups (so
long as the volume to capacity (v/c) ratio is less than 1.0). An overall LOS D is required for
signalized intersections on state roads, with LOS E acceptable for the approaches and lane
groups (so long as the volume to capacity (v/c) ratio is less than 1.0). The intersection analyses
were performed using Synchro version 8 for study area intersections.

The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 3 and indicate that the two signalized
intersections within the study area are anticipated to operate at an acceptable intersection
Level of Service (LOS) during the 2024 p.m. peak hour. The unsignalized intersection of SR 776

Roadway Analysis
In addition to the intersection analysis, a generalized roadway analysis was conducted for the
study roadway segments on Englewood Road/SR 776 from Rutgers Road to Manasota Beach
Road. For the analysis of these roadway segments, the service volumes found in Sarasota
County’s document “2012 Generalized Level of Service Analysis” were utilized.


The results of the analysis, which are summarized in Table 4, indicate that all roadway segments
within the study area are expected to operate at an acceptable LOS using the service volumes
listed in the “2012 Generalized Level of Service Analysis.”

Intersection Analysis
Intersection analyses were conducted for the study intersections using the background traffic
volumes and the background improvements required by HB 7207 which allow the
transportation network to operate at an acceptable LOS prior to the subject project being
developed.


The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 3 and indicate that signalization of the
existing unsignalized intersection of SR 776 & Bellagio Boulevard/Project Access is anticipated
to allow the intersection to operate with acceptable v/c ratios and LOS for all movements,
approaches, and overall intersection performance during the p.m. peak hour with background
traffic. Summary worksheets of the intersection analysis are provided in Appendix G.

analysis are provided in Appendix H.


Site Access Analysis
In addition, an analysis was also undertaken to determine turn lane needs for the proposed
project access point along SR 776 & Bellagio Boulevard/Project Access and the two access
points along Bellagio Boulevard.         The unsignalized access of SR 776 & Bellagio
Boulevard/Project Access has existing 340-foot exclusive northbound and southbound left turn
lanes. Based on a design speed of 50 mph, the required deceleration length is 240 feet. The
FDOT Plans Preparation Manual recommends a minimum queue length of 100 feet for urban
areas. The Synchro analysis for build-out conditions gives a 95th percentile queue length less
than 100 feet for the southbound left turn movement. Therefore, the existing southbound left
turn lane is of sufficient length to accommodate the project traffic at build-out utilizing FDOT
Turn Lane Calculation Guidelines.


The northbound right turn volume on SR 776/Englewood Road at Bellagio Boulevard is
anticipated to be 33 vehicles during the PM peak hour at project build-out. The FDOT Driveway
Handbook recommends an exclusive right turn deceleration lane for a right turning volume
between 80 and 125 vehicles per hour. Based on the nominal turning volume at this location,
an exclusive northbound right turn lane is not recommended.


The two site driveways on Bellagio Boulevard were evaluated for exclusive turn lane needs
based on the procedures outlined in the National Cooperative of Highway Research Programs
(NCHRP) Report 457. For the purpose of the turn lane analysis, a maximum development
threshold of 100 dwelling units was assumed for the north and/or south parcel on Bellagio
Boulevard. All of the project traffic entering the site will be from the intersection of SR 776 &
Bellagio Boulevard/Project Access. Therefore, for the eastbound left-turn lane warrant for the

site driveway for the north parcel, it was assumed that a maximum of 65 project trips utilize the
eastbound left-turn movement for site ingress (100 maximum dwelling units of the total 120
dwelling units). Similarly, for the eastbound right-turn lane warrant for the site driveway for the
south parcel, it was assumed that a maximum of 65 project trips will utilize the eastbound right-
turn movement for site ingress (100 maximum dwelling units of the total 120 dwelling units).
This is conservative, as it assumes the worst-case traffic scenario for both traffic movements.


Based on the marginal existing traffic volumes on Bellagio Boulevard, the anticipated ingress
traffic volumes do not warrant exclusive ingress turn lanes at the site driveways on Bellagio
Boulevard. The NCHRP turn lane warrant worksheets are included in Appendix I.


Roadway Analysis
In addition to the intersection analysis, a generalized roadway analysis was conducted for the
study roadway segments on Englewood Road (SR 776) from Rutgers Road to Manasota Beach
Road. The results of the analysis, which are summarized in Table 6, indicate that all roadway
segments within the study area are expected to operate at an acceptable LOS using the service
volumes listed in the “2012 Generalized Level of Service Analysis” with 2024 build-out traffic
conditions.


2024 (Build-Out Year) Total Traffic Volumes, HB 7207 Required Improvements, Project Traffic
Required Mitigation
The results of the intersection and roadway segment analysis show that no improvements are
anticipated to be required to provide acceptable level of service and operations within the
study area at 2024 project build-out. Therefore, no project traffic mitigation improvements
were assumed.

                                         CONCLUSION

The proposed Bellagio development, a single family development with up to 120 dwelling units,
is located on the north and south side of Bellagio Boulevard, east of SR 776/Englewood Road in
Sarasota County, Florida. Access to the development will be provided through two connections
to Bellagio Boulevard, which provides access to SR 776/Englewood Road at a full-access
unsignalized median opening. Neither the parcel north or south of Bellagio Boulevard will
contain more than 100 dwelling units.


The existing signalized intersections within the study area are expected to operate at
acceptable LOS with the build-out year (2024) background traffic and build-out year (2024)
total traffic considering the full build-out program. The existing unsignalized intersection of SR
776 & Bellagio Boulevard operates with a failing side-street level of service with existing and
build-out year (2024) background traffic conditions; therefore the installation of a traffic signal
with background conditions was assumed at project build-out based on House Bill 7207. The
intersection is expected to operate with acceptable level of service under build-out year (2024)
total traffic conditions assuming the HB 7207 improvement, with no additional improvements
needed.


The study roadway segments were analyzed with the addition of project traffic and are
expected to operate at an acceptable LOS in 2024 with generalized service volumes.


A turn lane analysis showed that the existing southbound left turn lane on SR 776 at Bellagio
Boulevard has sufficient length to accommodate the anticipated traffic at project build-out. The
anticipated traffic volumes do not warrant an exclusive northbound right turn lane on SR 776 at
Bellagio Boulevard. Exclusive ingress turn lanes on Bellagio Boulevard are not warranted at the
site access locations considering build-out year (2024) total traffic volumes.

Re:     Ventura Village
        East of SR 776/Englewood Road, North and South of Bellagio Boulevard
        Sarasota County, Florida
        Traffic Impact Study (TIS) Methodology

Dear Mr. Bing:

The purpose of this letter is to document the methodology for the Traffic Impact Study
which will be conducted for the Ventura Village proposed development. The project site is
located on the east side of SR 776/North Indiana Avenue, north and south of Bellagio
Boulevard in Sarasota County, Florida. The project location map is attached hereto as
Figure 1. The proposed methodology is provided below for your review and comments.

The Applicant (D. R. Horton) is seeking concurrency approval for the Ventura Village
project for up to 120 single-family residential dwelling units. A tradeoff (equivalency)
matrix will be allowed which will provide the opportunity for other land uses to be
substituted so long as the approved net external p.m. peak hour trips are not exceeded.
This opportunity accounts for the continually changing economic climate.

Access to the Ventura Village development will be provided through two unsignalized, full
access connections on Bellagio Boulevard, east of SR 776/Englewood Road. Neither the
parcel north or south of Bellagio Boulevard will conain more than 100 dwelling units.

To appropriately address transportation issues related to this residential development, the
analysis will be undertaken in accordance with the following procedures which are
consistent with Sarasota County Resolution No. 98-169 Traffic Impact Study (TIS)
guidelines:

                                                                                July 10, 2014

Transportation Concurrency Analysis

      Project Trip Generation: Trip generation for the proposed Ventura Village
      residential development will be based on the Institute of Transportation
      Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, for land use code 210 (Single-
      Family Detached Housing). The residential development is not proposed to
      contain any retail units, therefore pass-by and internal capture reductions were
      not considered. The trip generation table is provided in Table 1 as an attachment.

      Project Trip Distribution: The project traffic shall be assigned to the roadway
      network using the Florida Standard Urban Transportation Model Structure
      (FSUTMS) Sarasota-Manatee-Charlotte (SMC) transportation planning model,
      specifically the Existing plus Committed (E+C) network, with incorporation of the
      most current socio-economic and network data sets maintained by the
      Sarasota/Manatee MPO. The trip distribution for the proposed Ventura Village
      development is provided to the County for review and approval as part of this
      study methodology prior to proceeding with the analysis. This model distribution
      is provided as an attachment as Figure 2.

      Study Area: The study area roadway segments will be those that are defined as
      significantly impacted roadways, with the project traffic representing 5% or
      greater of the County’s Level of Service (LOS) C service volume, per the Sarasota
      County 2013 Generalized LOS Analysis table and Sarasota County’s “Traffic Impact
      Study Criteria and Methodology”. The study area intersections will be those
      intersections at the end points of the study area roadways identified to have been
      impacted greater than 5% (as described above). Any signalized intersections along
      significantly impacted study roadways are also included. A table summarizing the
      Study Area Determination is provided in Table 2 as an attachment. Based upon
      the trip generation and trip distribution analyses, the following intersections were
      determined to be within the study area:

          1. SR 776 & Rutgers Road
          2. SR 776 & Manasota Beach Road

      Access Connections: In addition to the above listed study area intersections, an
      analysis for the proposed project connection at the intersection of SR 776 &
      Bellagio Boulevard will be conducted

      Turn lane length analyses will be conducted for the project access at SR 776 &
      Bellagio Boulevard as well as the two unsignalized project access points along
      Bellagio Boulevard to determine the required turn lane length needed based on
      future total volumes. This analysis will be conducted according to FDOT Turn Lane
      Calculations Guidelines.

      Analysis Year Scenarios: The buildout year for the proposed Ventura Village
      residential development is anticipated to be 2024, and therefore, the analysis
                                                                             Mr. Marquis Bing
                                                                                 July 10, 2014
                                                                                        Page 3




       will be undertaken for the year 2024 conditions. The analysis will be
       conducted for p.m. peak-hour, peak-season conditions utilizing FDOT’s most
       recent published seasonal factor (SF).

       Background Traffic: Background (non-project) traffic will consist of existing
       traffic as identified in the traffic counts to be collected, as well as growth using
       the greater of the two:

           1. Sarasota County 2013 Generalized LOS and 2009-2012 Growth Rate
              with 2024 Volume Projection, or
           2. Vested trips, to be coordinated through Sarasota County and the City
              of Venice.

       Traffic Analysis: Roadway analysis procedures for this study will evaluate two-
       way study roadway segments using the Sarasota County service volumes or
       detailed roadway capacity analyses. The intersection analyses will be
       performed using the Synchro software package, which will utilize the
       methodologies provided in the Highway Capacity Manual.

       The analysis will be conducted for four p.m. peak-hour scenarios, and will
       include the following:

           ·    Existing (2014) traffic conditions;
           ·    Future (2024) background (without project) traffic volumes both with
                and without the appropriate roadway and/or intersection
                improvements, per Community Planning Act HB 7207 (2011), needed
                to provide an acceptable level of service to the study roadway and/or
                signalized intersections;
           ·    Future (2024) buildout/total traffic volumes (with project), including
                the Community Planning Act HB 7207 (2011) improvements needed
                for the “without project” scenario; and
           ·    Future (2024) buildout/total traffic volumes (with project, including
                Community Planning Act HB 7207 (2011) improvements needed for
                the “without project” scenario) with improvements to correct any
                deficiencies caused by the addition of project traffic.

For improvements that are identified to be needed by the proposed project (per the
2011 Community Planning Act HB 7207 methodology), a proportionate share
calculation will be conducted.

We will follow-up with you to determine if you have any questions or comments
regarding this transportation methodology. We look forward to working with you on
this traffic study.

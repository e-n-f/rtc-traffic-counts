5.     PRESENTATIONS
       A.      Proclamation: Thank a Police Officer Day-September 19, 2015
               City Manager Drake explained that Trudy Hauser, a local resident, brought it to Staff’s
               attention that Thank a Police Officer Day was a national effort. Staff and Police Chief
               Moss liked the idea and encouraged the City Council to adopt the proclamation.

               Mayor Dalin read the proclamation declaring September 19, 2015 as Thank a Police
               Officer Day.

       B.      Plastic Bag Ban:
               City Manager Drake said he had conferred with Mayor Dalin, who agreed hearing a
               presentation on the plastic bag ban was a good idea. He noted that a two-page handout
               about plastic bag use was included in the City Council Packet.

               Elaine Cole, Forest Grove Sustainability Commission, stated that she and Mr. Hayes had
               been working on banning plastic bags for almost a year. They drafted a plastic bag
               ordinance for the City of Forest Grove and were asked by the City Council in a work
               session to take the pulse of different cities in Washington County and talk to their
               sustainability colleagues, which was why she was making an effort to reach out. She
               appreciated the opportunity to speak to Council about this issue.

               John Hayes, Forest Grove Sustainability Commission, explained that the ordinance
               would ban single-use plastic checkout bags within the city limits of Forest Grove for all
               businesses. The ordinance would levy a 5 cent charge for use of paper bags, but there
               would be many exemptions, such as items that were wet or might leak so a plastic bag
               could be used. Pharmacy bags, bakery bags, fruits and vegetable bags, small hardware
               items, and dry-cleaning bags would all be exempt as well. The Sustainability Commission
               voted to bring the issue before City Council many reasons, and he noted the negative
               impact to wildlife, especially sea turtles and whales. He reviewed the results of a poll
               taken from 41 citizens at a public forum held last Wednesday, which asked questions
               about plastic bag use, including whether plastic bags were harmful to the environment,
               whether participants supported a plastic bag ban, and a series of questions about
               imposing a 5 cent paper bag fee or 10 cent plastic or paper bag fee, or offering a 25 cent
               credit for reusable bags with no ban on plastic bags. Based on the input from the public
               forum, the Forest Grove City Council was not going to ban plastic bags. The
               Sustainability Commission has its work cut out for them and he was sure the Cornelius
               City Council would be in the same situation if they were facing this issue.

               Ms. Cole explained behavior change research has shown that incurring a cost helped
               people change their behavior and made them think twice. The 5 cent charge was being
Cornelius City Council
Minutes–September 8, 2015                           Page 2 of 7
               used to facilitate a change to reusable bags. In this instance, businesses would charge
               and retain the 5 cent fee.

               Mr. Hayes added the purpose of the charge was also an attempt to recognize that paper
               bags were not particularly good for the environment either. Paper bags take more
               energy to produce, must be transported, and take up more space in the trash and
               landfills. The concept of moving to reusable bags as a society would probably not
               happen in his lifetime, but if people were allowed to have paper bags, they would just
               continue using them, which was another reason for the charge.

               Mayor Dalin said he was trying to understand the desire to legislate the amount rather
               than leave it to free enterprise and let businesses determine whether they could get
               away with charging the customers that amount or not.

               Discussion continued about the reuse of single-use plastic bags compared to plastic
               garbage bags, which required more petroleum to make and were more expensive, and
               statistics showing that reusing plastic bags was not as prevalent as those in the plastics
               industry believe. Though Seattle had banned plastic bags, a Seattle resident at the public
               forum shared that plastic bags are still quite ubiquitous in Seattle. The dangers of
               reusable bags not being washed regularly were also discussed, as well as issues with the
               weight limits of paper bags.

               Mr. Hayes noted that with a Community Enhance Program (CEP) Grant they received for
               the City of Forest Grove and $5,000 of available funds in the budget, the Sustainability
               Commission had amassed enough funds to buy a reusable bag for each of Forest Grove's
               8,000 residents. While they had not made a final decision as to which specific bag they
               would buy, but would definitely choose a bag that was machine washable.

               Mayor Dalin thanked Ms. Cole and Mr. Hayes for their time and asked that the
               Sustainability Commission keep the Council updated on how the issue in Forest Grove
               developed.

       A.      Resolution No. 2015-26: Non Represented and Management COLA



Cornelius City Council
Minutes–September 8, 2015                           Page 3 of 7
               City Manager Drake presented the Agenda Report, noting that traditionally the City
               Council performs an annual review of potential Cost Of Living Allowances (COLA) and
               normally followed a standard Cost of Living Allowance and/or an adjustment that was
               negotiated in labor contracts. Staff recommended the Council adopt that same 1.5%
               that was negotiated and adopted for non-represented and management employees. He
               clarified that City Council ultimately set its own salary levels. In his experience managing
               other cities, he found that many cities ask lay members of the Budget Committee to
               form a subcommittee and review the salaries of the Council and the mayor for the sake
               of transparency and to allay any concerns that the elected officials were not padding
               their own pockets. He recommended that lay members of the Budget Committee form a
               working group to examine the salaries and see how the City Councilors and the mayor
               compared with their peers, adding Council had the authority to ask a third-party to
               review the compensation levels. He noted that the countless hours Council spent
               representing the City at various regional meetings, local groups, etc. should also be
               considered. He recalled that the City of Tualatin gave their Council and mayor a
               discount on utility bills as compensation for time spent. He asked the Council to
               consider the issue and possibly instruct Staff to take action or form a committee at the
               next meeting.

A motion was made by Councilor Orozco to approve Resolution No. 2015-26, A RESOLUTION OF THE
CORNELIUS CITY COUNCIL RELATED TO COMPENSATION FOR COST OF LIVING INCREASES FOR NON
REPRESENTED AND MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES and this action takes effect July 1st, 2015, seconded
by Council Crowder. Motion carried 4-0. Ayes: Councilor Heinrich, Councilor Crowder, Councilor
Orozco, and Mayor Dalin.

               Following a brief discussion, Council agreed to have City Manager Drake compile a list of
               Council member compensation in 10 to 20 comparable cities to see how Cornelius
               ranked. The Council would decide whether to take further action and have the Budget
               Committee review the information when dealing with the budget.

       B.      Resolution No. 2015-27: Authorization to Apply for CDBG Funding

               City Engineer Keyes presented the Agenda Report, noting Staff was not sure the top
               sidewalk improvement on Dogwood from 14th to 20th Ave qualified for Community
               Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding. If the CDBG Staff determined that the project
               did not qualify, Staff would apply for Heather Street, Harleman Park, and Ginger Street
               from 10th to 12th Ave. If the Dogwood project did qualify, they would proceed with the
               Dogwood and Heather Streets’ improvements, but exclude Ginger Street.

               Mayor Dalin explained many mayors in the region have become very enthusiastic about
               the Safe Routes to School Program and were looking at that as a primary focus area for
               such grant money. He asked if different streets would be involved if the focus was on
               Safe Routes to School. City Engineer Keyes explained the CDBG used schools as a
               criterion for scoring. Heather Street was near Echo Shaw School, putting it in good
Cornelius City Council
Minutes–September 8, 2015                            Page 4 of 7
               shape. The Dogwood project went right up to where Head Start built sidewalks, and the
               City built sidewalks from 12th to Dogwood from the other direction. Ginger Street
               connected to collector streets that lead to Echo Shaw as well. All three projects were
               probably the best the City could have for Safe Routes to Schools.

A motion was made by Councilor Orozco to approve Resolution No. 2015-27, AUTHORIZING THE CITY
OF CORNELIUS TO APPLY FOR CDBG FUNDING FOR SIDEWALK PROJECTS AND AUTHORIZING CITY
STAFF TO SIGN THE GRANT APPLICATIONS and this action takes effect immediately, seconded by
Councilor Crowder. Motion carried 4-0. Ayes: Councilor Heinrich, Councilor Crowder, Councilor Orozco,
and Mayor Dalin.

9.     REPORTS
       A.      City Council:
               Councilors Heinrich and Orozco had nothing to report.

               Councilor Crowder reported that a Policy Advisory Board meeting was held on August
               6th. The Board would meet on September 17th in Hillsboro, so he would see what
               resulted from that.

       B.      Mayor’s Report:
               Mayor Dalin reported that the Washington County Coordinating Committee (WCCC) met
               in late August, early September and the Joint Policy Budget Committee Transportation
               would meet on Thursday. He reported on the Region 1 ACT meeting, for which he was
               the Washington County representative. He noted the deadline to apply for State funds
               had been extended, so there was still time if the City wanted to apply for projects that
               would involve funds from the State Transportation Improvement Project System. He
               confirmed there was not a lot of money available in the program, but wanted to ensure
               everyone was aware that the deadline had been extended. He would send information
               regarding the successes the Region 1 ACT had seen from the ITS investments made
               around Highways 217 and 226 to City Recorder‐Treasurer Roth so she could forward it
               to the Councilors.

       C.      City Manager Report:
               City Manager Drake noted that the October 3rd would mark the 10th Spanish-speaking
               town hall, adding the City would partner with Centro Cultural Washington County.
               Marni Kuyl, Washington County Health and Human Services Director, would provide an
               update about what has happened since July 1st, as the Latino community has been very
               concerned about the closure of some of the smaller health clinics in the County. The City
               would again partner with the Veterans of Foreign War and American Legion on for the
               Veterans Day celebration at 1:00 PM on November 11th. The County's Honor Guard
               would present the colors at the event and have a rifle salute, and once again, a bagpipe
               player would perform. The Second Annual Community Thanksgiving Dinner would be
               held November 21st at Cornelius Grade School from 4 PM to 7 PM, and volunteers would

Minutes–September 8, 2015                           Page 5 of 7
               be needed. The Fourth Annual Holiday Tree Lighting would be on Thursday, December
               3rd because Forest Grove schools would be closed on Friday. One principal was
               concerned that families might be dispersing on Friday since school would be closed that
               day. He noted the activities planned for the event.

                      CPD Personnel Updates
               Mr. Drake said Police Chief Gene Moss would provide the update and noted the
               handout in the meeting packet with pictures of the new officers. Chief Moss would also
               respond to the Council's concern regarding qualified Spanish speakers in the police
               department, and this was when there would be some annual turnover for the special
               assignment, so the Chief would discuss that as well.

               Police Chief Moss stated the police department recently begun the bidding process and
               six new deputies had bid for the specialty, one-year assignment. With the influx of the
               new deputies, combined with the deputies that had been in Cornelius for the last year,
               there would be three Spanish-speaking officers. One officer, a female deputy named
               Maribel Camas, was a Certified Spanish-speaker. The other two deputies were
               conversational and fully fluent, but had not tested for that certification.

               He responded to questions from Council, noting that no deputies were from the original
               Cornelius Police Department (CPD). Two former CPD officers, Deputy DeHaven and
               Deputy Harris, who were deputies in the department this past year, had chosen to bid
               to work in a different part of the County because although they loved Cornelius and
               intended to return, they wanted to experience working in other parts of the County and
               Chief Moss had encouraged them to do so. He confirmed Officer Cage had been with
               the CPD previously, and clarified that Maribel Camas, Nick Jones, Brian McLeod, Chris
               Plewik, Ryan Tack, and Ben Wiley were all new deputies, although Deputy Camas had
               worked in Cornelius for three weeks to fill in for an injured deputy. He announced the
               department had received quite a positive response regarding the new amber flashing

              to adopt comprehensive plan amendments to allow for annexation and development of
              properties included within the city’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) in 2014.

Background: Approximately 345 acres of property was added to the City’s UGB in 2014 as part of the Grand
            Bargain. Prior to allowing this properties to annex into the City and develop at urban densities
            the City must first adopt comprehensive plan amendments to guide the future zoning and
            identify how services can be provided to the properties. City staff spent a good portion of 2014
            working with consultants and community members to arrive that the recommendation that is
            before the Council.

Financial Implications: Financial implication associated with the amendments are addressed within the
             documents and include analysis of costs and how those costs will be provided for.

            15th, 2015 they reconvened and made a formal recommendation to the City Council to adopt
            ordinances 2015-06 and 2015-07 with the following amendment to staffs’ recommendation:

              To amend Exhibit N so that the recommendations sections reads as follows (underlined

                  2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
                     facilities being used to meet subdivision stormwater quality or quantities requirements.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL
Effective April 1, 2014 approximately 345 acres of land were added to the City of Cornelius Urban
Growth Boundary (UGB) as a result of the legislature approving House Bill 4078, often referred
to as the “Grand Bargain”. The report and supporting documents are intended to support approval
of the City of Cornelius Ordinances 2015-07 (Exhibit A) and 2015-06 (Exhibit B) which seek to
adopt comprehensive plan designations for properties added to the UGB in 2014. In addition this
report and supporting documents identify the public services necessary to support the
urbanization of those properties added to the UGB. The report also supports the adoption of the
Council Creek Trail Master Plan as a component of the 2009 Parks Master Plan. Specific services
addressed within this report and proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan include
transportation (Exhibit G), water (Exhibit K), sanitary sewer (Exhibit L), stormwater (Exhibit N) and
parks and recreation (Exhibit H and M).

2014 NE URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY




The NE UGB is comprised of a mixture of lot sizes and existing development. The eastern,
western and northern (north of the railroad line) portion of the area are characterized by larger
lots with varying potential for additional residential development. The central portion of the area
is characterized by individual lots that are developed to very low density urban standards, these
areas are unlikely to redevelop in the future at a higher density. The area is currently served
with water by the City of Hillsboro, although much of the system is undersized and/or not

developed to City standards. The existing roadways provide for vehicle travel lanes, the streets
are not developed to City standards. All of this area is located north of State Highway 8 (TV
Highway) with the exception on one lot located south of the Highway. The City identified trails
and a future community park within the City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan (see Exhibit M).

2014 SE URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY




The SE UGB is comprised of a mixture of lot sizes and existing development. The area UGB
area is not currently served by water or sanitary sewer service. The only existing roadway within
the area is SW 345th Avenue which serves as the eastern border for the new UGB. The City has
three (3) collector roadways that are stubbed to the new UGB. These roadways are S. 20th
Avenue, S. 26th Avenue, and S. Dogwood Street. South Alpine Street also stubs into the SE
UGB and is designated a local street. Most of this area is located below the existing sanitary
sewer collection system within the City. The City identified trails and a future community park
within the City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan (see Exhibit M).

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
The City worked closely with Harper Houf Peterson Righellis (HHPR) to design and implement
the public engagement process for the project. The process included three (3) basic approaches
to gathering information and engaging the community in the process. The first was a series of
stakeholder surveys that were conducted with residents, property owners and service providers
within the 2014 UGB area. The second approach was a community survey that was available
online and as a hardcopy. The City hosted three (3) neighborhood meetings during the process
to share information and solicit feedback. The City also appointed a Technical Advisory
Committee (TAC) to assist staff with reviewing information and forming the recommendation that
is contained within this report. More detailed information is available below about each of the
processes. All of the comments received by the City throughout the process (as of 10-01-15) are
included as Exhibit C of this report. The City also hosted a webpage that provided information
about the process, upcoming meetings, and provided draft exhibits and reports for stakeholders
to access. Notices for public meetings were posted at City Hall, the Public Works Building, and
within the Forest Grove News Times. Articles were included about the meetings and survey within
the Cornelius Gazette, a monthly paper distributed to residents in English and Spanish with their
water bills. Notice of meetings was also provided on the City’s reader board attached to the east
side of the Cornelius Council Chambers along N. Adair Street. Staff also reached out to the
Oregonian and Forest Grove News Times to encourage the papers to write articles about the
meetings. Throughout the process the City maintained a mailing list of interested parties and
provided mailed notice regarding meeting content, times and dates.

STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS
City staff conducted face to face interviews with property owners and service providers within both
the NE and SE UGB areas. The goal of these interviews was to provide a forum for the City to
collect information first hand from the residents, property owners and service providers. Staff
spoke with Forest Grove School District, Hillsboro School District, the Oregon Department of
Transportation, Clean Water Services, Metro, Washington County, Centro Cultural, as well as
several property owners in the NE and SE UGB areas.

COMMUNITY SURVEY
HHPR prepared a community survey designed to solicit feedback from the community. The survey
was available on-line, interested parties were mailed notice of the survey and opportunity was
provided for people to fill out a hardcopy if they were unable to gain access to the internet. The
survey was completed by 46 people, 28 of the respondents self-identified as being from the NE
UGB, 6 self-identified as being from the SE UGB area, and 7 declined to disclose. This is not a
statistically valid survey, it was utilized as another forum to provide the community the opportunity
to provide input into the process, especially for those who were not able to make the neighborhood
meetings. A summary of the responses is included as Exhibit D to this report.

In general the respondents from the NE area valued new parks, walking paths and biking paths
less than those in SE. Approximately 2/3rds of the respondents did not want additional
commercial services and most of the respondents favored a pattern of residential development
utilizing larger lots with less common open space.

TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE
The City formed a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to assist with review of the technical
studies. The TAC was comprised of City Staff, a Planning Commission member, property owners
from both the NE and SE UGB as well as professional staff from Clean Water Services (CWS),

Metro, Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Washington County. All meetings were
open to the public and notice was mailed to interested parties, citizens were in attendance at all
the meetings listening to the discussion.

The first TAC meeting was held on February 25, 2015. At the meeting the consultant team
presented information about existing conditions, initial technical findings regarding the sanitary
sewer system, a summary of information received from the stakeholder interviews and information
received from the first neighborhood meeting. The intent of the meeting was to discuss the
opportunities and constraints and to solicit guidance in the development of preliminary
recommendations.

The second TAC meeting was held on April 23, 2015. At the meeting the consultant team
summarized the feedback received at the second neighborhood meeting and presented
preliminary recommendations for comprehensive plan map amendments. The intent of the
meeting was to solicit input to refine the recommendations for the comprehensive plan map
amendments.

The third TAC meeting was held on June 17, 2015. At the meeting the consultant team presented
the draft findings from the technical memorandums as well as the proposed comprehensive plan
map amendments. The intent of the meeting was to solicit input and identify any revisions that
may be necessary prior to public hearings and adoption.

NEIGHBORHOOD REVIEW MEETING #1
The first Neighborhood Meeting was held on January 8, 2015. The goal of the meeting was to
provide a forum for the community to share information, ask questions and voice concerns about
the planning process. Staff began the meeting by providing an overview of the process that was
utilized to add lands to the UGB in 2014. Staff detailed the process and expected timeline for the
project and provided information about how stakeholders could be involved in the process moving
forward. Staff facilitated an exercise to identify opportunities and constraints that would be used
to guide the process (Exhibit E). Staff provided an opportunity for community members to ask
questions. Approximately 71 people attended the meeting based on signatures collected on the
sign in sheets.

NEIGHBORHOOD REVIEW MEETING #2
The second Neighborhood Meeting was held on March 18, 2015. The goal of the meeting was to
provide a forum for the community to finalize the opportunities and constraints for the planning
project. At the meeting the consultant team and city staff provided a summary of the stakeholder
interviews, the first TAC meeting as well as the results of the community survey. At the meeting
an overview of each area was provided including information about what potential zoning and
associated comprehensive plan designations could be applied. Specific information was also
provided about existing planned improvements within the City’s parks master plan and
transportation system plan. DKS provided an overview of the existing conditions for the
transportation system. Summary notes from the meeting are included as Exhibit F. Approximately
51 people attended the meeting based on signatures collected on the sign in sheets.

NEIGHBORHOOD REVIEW MEETING #3
The third Neighborhood Meeting was held on May 20, 2015. The goal of the meeting was to
provide a forum for the community to review the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, ask
questions and provide feedback about the amendments. People were encouraged to submit

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MAP DESIGNATIONS (LAND USE)
The City is proposing to adopt comprehensive plan map designations for the properties that were
added to the UGB in 2014. The adoption of the comprehensive plan designations will not directly
affect the properties within the 2014 UGB at this time as those properties are still located within
Washington County’s jurisdiction. The zoning and corresponding rules and regulations that
currently exist on the properties as administered by Washington County will remain until those
properties are annexed into the City of Cornelius. The proposed comprehensive plan map land
use designations will guide how the properties will be zoned upon annexation to the City. Since
some of the comprehensive plan map designations can be implemented by more than one zone
Exhibit I and Exhibit J attached to this report include the proposed comprehensive plan map
designations and corresponding zoning to be applied when the properties are annexed.

2014 NE UGB
The 2014 NE UGB is proposed to be designated primarily residential on the comprehensive plan
map, the one exception is a parcel of land that is located south of the TV Highway just east of the
Coastal Farms store, this parcel is proposed to be designated commercial and will be zoned
Highway Commercial (C-2) when it is annexed into the City. The existing manufactured home
park along the western edge of the 2014 NE UGB is proposed to be designated Medium-density
Residential and will be zoned Manufactured Home Park (MHP) upon annexation to reflect the
existing use of the property. The remaining land within the 2014 NE UGB is proposed to
designated Low-density Residential and will be zoned either R-7 or R-10 as detailed within Exhibit
I.

2014 SE UGB
The 2014 SE UGB is proposed to be designated a mix of Low- and Medium-density Residential
on the comprehensive plan map. Low-density Residential is proposed to be designated along the
existing City Limits and along SW 345th Avenue for a width of 150 feet. This area would be zoned
R-7 upon annexation. The intent of this zoning is to match the existing development pattern within
the City and to provide a transition of density from the new 2014 SE UGB to the existing farmland
to east of SW 345th Avenue. The remaining land within the 2014 SE UGB is proposed to be
designated Medium-density Residential and will be zoned A-2 which is the City’s multi-family
zone. It is important to note that the A-2 zone permits a range of housing types beyond multi-
family including attached single family and detached single family development. See Exhibit J for
more detail and the location and extent of the proposed comprehensive plan designations.

UTILITIES FOR 2014 URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY
In order to allow for annexation of lands added to the UGB in 2014, the City must identify how
these properties can address stormwater requirements, be served with sanitary sewer service,
water service, and how properties are accessed and what public improvements are necessary to
support development.

SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM
CWS operates the sanitary sewer treatment plants within Washington County. Based on
coordination with CWS there is adequate capacity within their treatment and regional
conveyance facilities to accommodate the projected growth of the NE and SE UGB areas.
HHPR prepared a technical memorandum (Exhibits L) identifying the improvements to the local
conveyance system that will be necessary to support the development of the NE and SE UGB
areas. The City is seeking to amend the Cornelius Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (Appendices H
of the Cornelius Comprehensive Plan). Each of the improvements identified as necessary are
summarized below and detailed within Exhibit L.


NE UGB Sanitary Sewer
The NE UGB can be served with sanitary sewer service via the extension of the existing gravity
sewer system that is located to the north and south of the area. The conceptual layout set forth
in Exhibit L identifies four (4) sewer sub-basins that would convey the wastewater to the existing
sanitary line that services the mobile home park or the Council Creek Trunk Sewer which is
located north of the UGB. Detailed information concerning the proposed flows and capacity of
existing facilities is provided within the technical memorandum included within Exhibit L.

SE UGB Sanitary Sewer
A portion of the SE area located along the western edge can be served with sanitary sewer via
the extension of the existing gravity sewer system that is located within S. Ginger Street. The
majority of the SE UGB will require the construction of a pump station and force main
(pressurized sanitary sewer line) to provide sanitary sewer service. The point of connection to
the existing system will be at S. 20th Avenue and S. Ginger Street. Approximately 3,005 linear
feet of existing sanitary sewer line will need to be increased in size in order to provide sanitary
sewer service for the full build out of the SE UGB. Detailed information concerning the proposed
flows and capacity of existing facilities is provided within the technical memorandum included
within Exhibit L.

WATER SYSTEM
The City of Cornelius purchases bulk water from the City of Hillsboro and operates and
maintains a water distribution system within City Limits. There is a 72” water main that is located
within the TV Highway that provides water to the City. The City currently operates a 2 million
gallon storage reservoir within the City and is in the process of designing and constructing an
Aquifer Storage and Recharge (ASR) system that will allow the City to store approximately 50
million gallons of water. The water supply and storage system is adequate to provide for the
development of the 2014 UGB. More detailed information concerning the water system is
provided in a technical memorandum included within Exhibit K. The proposed water distribution
system is described in more detail below for each of the two areas.

NE UGB Water
The NE UGB currently is served with municipal water service by the City of Hillsboro, this
system was in place prior to the establishment of the City of Cornelius UGB. The existing
system does not meet City standards, many of the pipes are undersized and not constructed to
City standards. This area of the UGB will continue to be served by the City of Hillsboro. As
properties are annexed into the City and developed, existing distribution lines will be required to
be improved to meet City standards. The City will only accept lines and assume responsibility
for maintenance when the lines are brought up to City standards. The existing lines within NW
341st Avenue will be replaced with a 12 inch line. The remaining lines within NW 338th, 336th,
and 334th will be replaced with 8 inch lines. More detailed information concerning the water
system is provided in technical memorandum included within Exhibit K.

SE UGB Water
There is no water system that currently serves the SE UGB, however, there are existing water
lines within S. 20th Ave., S. 26th Ave, S Dogwood St., and S. Alpine St. The proposed water
system to serve the SE UGB will be extended from this existing system within the new
roadways that will provide vehicular access to the SE UGB. All lines within the SE UGB will be
designed and constructed to City standards, a minimum of 8 inch in size. New lines proposed to
be constructed within Collector roadways will be required to be 12 inches in size. More detailed
information concerning the water system is provided in the technical memorandum included
within Exhibit K.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
Staff is proposing amendments to the Transportation System Plan (TSP) in order to ensure the
existing and planned transportation system is adequate to meet the anticipated development of
the NE and SE UGB’s. The City contracted with DKS and Associates, a transportation engineering
and planning consultant to assist with analyzing the transportation system and potential impacts
associated with development of the additional land added to the City’s UGB in 2014. The graphic
below shows the six (6) intersections that were studied as part of the analysis. DKS worked closely
with City staff, ODOT staff and County staff to scope the proposed transportation analysis which
is included within Exhibit G.




SE UGB Transportation System
The graphic above depicts the additional improvements necessary (beyond those projects
identified within the City’s TSP) to support the build out of the SE UGB. Specifically the
proposed collectors are shown depicted as dashed lines. During the planning process City staff
expressed concern regarding the timing of the S. 29th Avenue intersection and corridor
improvement. Based on the analysis conducted by DKS intended to alleviate staff’s concerns
and achieve livability goals, city staff is recommending that development connecting to S. 20th
Avenue should be limited to 130 residential units and development connecting to 26th Avenue
should be limited to 260 residential units prior to construction of the 29th Avenue connection to
Tualatin Valley Highway. If development constructs a roadway connection within the southeast
area between S. 20th and S. 26th Avenues, then a combined development limit of 390 residential
units could be applied. More detail concerning the transportation analysis is presented within
Exhibit G.

NE UGB Transportation System

The NE UGB is primarily developed with low density residential uses, there is an existing street
network within the area, however, streets are not improved to City standards. City staff and the
consultant team examined opportunities for proposing an east-west roadway to provide more

connectivity in the area. It was determined that this type of improvement was not necessary given
the relatively low density of residential development proposed within the area and the existing
residents desire to maintain their existing development pattern. The proposed commercially
designated parcel south of the TV Highway was analyzed using both the Metro Regional Travel
Demand Model as well as the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation approach
due to concerns raised by community members. Utilizing the ITE approach, the reasonable worst
case development expected to be constructed on the property may result in a volume to capacity
(v/c) ratio greater than the ODOT performance standard of 0.99 at the driveway intersection
on the highway. This estimated v/c ratio would be determined by the Transportation Planning
Rule to be a “significant effect”. The analysis completed by DKS notes the potential for localized
traffic impacts at the commercial development driveway and recommends the upcoming
Transportation System Plan update scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2016 look at options
to address access, capacity and safety needs along the TV Highway corridor. Based on how the
property develops, a number of solutions could be implemented to address this concern including
but not limited to the following:

            1. If the proposed development of the property warrants a signal and is approved by
               ODOT, one could be installed to mitigate the impact at the driveway.
            2. If the proposed development does not meet warrants for a signal, the proposed
               development could be limited to right-in/right-out access or a similar access
               management solution designed to mitigate the impacts.
            3. The proposed development could work with adjacent properties to provide for a
               frontage connection south of TV Highway and install a signal at the existing
               Coastal Farms driveway. This option would require ODOT approval and
               cooperation from Coastal Farms as well as the intervening property owner who
               has a driveway just to the west of the subject property.

Any development on the property that results in more than 200 vehicular trips per day will trigger
the need to complete a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) as part of the land use review process for
the City as detailed in 18.143.030 of the Cornelius City Code. Section 18.143.030(C) provides the
City Engineer additional discretion to require a TIA even when proposed development results in
less than 200 vehicle trips per day. In addition, the TV Highway is Oregon State Highway 8 which
is an ODOT facility. Development of the subject property will require the applicant to obtain
approval from ODOT prior to development, at which time ODOT can also require a TIA.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
The terrain in NE and SE UGB area is generally flat. The NE area largely slopes to the north
toward Council Creek. The only waterway in this area is a large wetland area that separates the
NE UGB expansion area from the current City boundary. This wetland area drains north toward
Council Creek. The only existing stormwater facilities in the NE UGB area are roadside and
trackside ditches along Baseline, the north-south streets traversing the area, and the railroad
north of Baseline.
The SE area primarily slopes to the south toward the Tualatin River. The only waterway in this
area is an agricultural ditch that starts where S. 26th Avenue turns into Webb Road and then
traverses in a south-southwest direction toward the Tualatin River. The stormwater facilities in the
SE UGB area are limited to the roadside ditches on SW 345th Avenue and railroad ditches along
the railroad south of Baseline.
As development occurs with these areas, the existing facilities are expected to be replaced with
facilities meeting current Clean Water Service (CWS) standards. While this approach is not
innovative, it has been used successfully for decades in urban Washington County to manage
stormwater runoff. The existing topography of the two UGB areas do not dictate the need to be
creative, thus the development of the UGB’s will be afforded flexibility in how the stormwater
systems are designed and constructed provided those facilities meet CWS standards. The only
variations from the CWS standards are:

    1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems, e.g., Stormfilters, for treatment on
       parts of the system that the City must maintain in the future, i.e., facilities to be dedicated
       to the City.
    2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot Low Impact
       Development Approach (LIDA) facilities.

The reason for the prohibition on proprietary systems is the additional maintenance burden these
pose for the City at a time when stormwater maintenance funding is extremely limited. Likewise,
the single-family lot LIDA facilities require on-going City inspection and oversight.

PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
The 2009 City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan provided for new improvements within both the NE
and SE UGB prior to those lands being included within the UGB (see Exhibit M). The proposed
amendments to the Parks Master Plan include removing some proposed trails that are located
outside of the UGB, adopting the Council Creek Trail Master Plan, and reducing the size of a
planned park (see Exhibit M). The City of Cornelius has had plans for a trail along Council Creek
since the 2009 Parks Master Plan was established. The associated adoption of the Council Creek
Trail Master Plan (Exhibit H) will relocate the proposed trail from along the creek corridor to within
the existing railroad right-of-way that bisects the NE UGB. The Council Creek Trail Master Plan
also calls for a north-south trail connection to connect in with a planned trail system along the
Tualatin River. The Council Creek Trail Master Plan identifies the preferred alignment for the trail,
estimated costs and associated trailhead locations to provide access to the trail. This plan and
associated alignment was arrived at after a detailed public study was completed in conjunction
with the Cities of Banks, Forest Grove, and Hillsboro as well as Washington County. A complete
copy of the plan is available on the City’s web site, hard copies are available for review at the
planning department. A summary of the proposed changes to the parks master plan is included
within Exhibit A and Exhibit B.

NE UGB Parks and Open Space
The proposed amendments for the NE UGB include changing the proposed Community Park
(CP-1) to a Neighborhood Park (NP), this is proposed in light of the relatively low residential
density proposed within the NE UGB. Staff is also recommending removing the proposed
section of trail along Council Creek that is proposed on private property (see Exhibit M). This
proposed for two reasons:
            1. The property owners have clearly communicated their desire to not have the trail;
                 and
            2. The area where the trail is proposed is highly unlikely to ever be included within
                 the City’s UGB.

SE UGB Parks and Open Space
Within the SE UGB the proposed amendments to the Parks Master Plan are solely related to
adopting the Council Creek Trail Master Plan (Exhibit H). Specifically the proposed adoption
identifies an alignment for a trail connecting the Council Creek Trail to the planned trail network
proposed within the SE UGB and along the Tualatin River.

SCHOOLS
The City of Cornelius is within both the Forest Grove School District (FGSD) as well as the
Hillsboro School District (HSD). The vast majority of the SE UGB area is within the HSD with a
small portion of the western edge located within the FGSD. All of the NE UGB is located within
the HSD. Staff coordinated with both school districts during the planning process to determine if
there was need for additional land to support new facilities to accommodate the development of
the 2014 UGB.

The FGSD noted that they had adequate capacity within the existing facilities to accommodate
the expected increase from development of the SE UGB. The HSD owns a 41 acre property
located in the SE UGB which can be utilized to accommodate future facilities (see Exhibit J).

NATURAL RESOURCES
The City works closely with CWS to protect natural resources located within and adjacent the
UGB. Those areas that have or are reasonably likely to have Goal 5 resources have the Natural
Resource Overlay (NRO) applied at the time of annexation and are subject to the provisions of
Chapter 18.95 of the Cornelius City Code. Furthermore, the City works closely with CWS,
requiring applicants to obtain a Service Provider Letter (SPL) prior to deeming a development
application complete and initiating review. This process assures that Goal 5 resources are
identified as to their quantity, quality and location prior to development occurring. If there is the
need to impact a resource for a transportation facility or other need, this process assures that
any temporary or permanent impacts are quantified and mitigated.

The NE UGB is bounded to the north by the Council Creek and its associate floodplain and to
the west by a tributary of Council Creek. These areas are protected Goal 5 resources. The SE
area is bounded to the south by the Tualatin River and its associated floodplain, these are
protected Goal 5 resources. Prior to annexation property owners will be required to submit a
wetland determination completed by qualified professional in order to ascertain the potential
presence of wetlands. If potential wetland resources are identified during the annexation
process, prior to development of a site the applicant will be required to submit a wetland
delineation that has been concurred with by the Oregon Department of State Lands.

OREGON STATEWIDE PLANNING GOALS
Goal 1: Citizen Involvement
To develop a citizen involvement program that insures the opportunity for citizens to be involved
in all phases of the planning process.

Finding:        The City has an acknowledged comprehensive plan and municipal code that has
                been found to be in compliance with Goal 1. The City conducted extensive
                outreach throughout the planning process with the goal of engaging as much of
                the citizenry as possible. The City exceeded the state and local requirements for
                notice and made all meetings open to public review including the TAC meetings.
                The City is proposing to host public hearings at the planning commission and city
                council as part of the adoption of the proposed amendments. Based on the
                information contained within this report and facts and findings in support of the
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments the City has conducted the planning
                process in compliance with statewide planning goal 1.

Goal 2: Land Use Planning
To establish a land use planning process and policy framework as a basis for all decision and
actions related to use of land and to assure an adequate factual base of such decisions and
actions.

Finding:        The City has an acknowledged comprehensive plan and municipal code that has
                been found to be in compliance with Goal 2. The City has provided the proper
                notice as required by the comprehensive plan and Cornelius City Code. Affected
                governmental agencies have been engaged in the development of the
                comprehensive plan amendments and/or provided notice of the proposed
                amendments consistent with the intent of this goal. The proposed amendments
                do not seek any exceptions to Statewide Planning Goals. Based on the
                information contained within this report and facts and findings in support of the
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments the City has conducted the planning
                process in compliance with statewide planning goal 2.

Goal 3: Agricultural Lands
To preserve and maintain agricultural lands.

Finding:        No goal exception is requested or required to Goal 3. The lands that are the
                subject of the proposed comprehensive plan amendments were included within
                the City of Cornelius UGB in 2014 as a result of a legislative action. The
                proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan map took into account the
                existence of farm land adjacent to the UGB and proposed to use low density
                residential zones, natural resource areas and existing transportation facilities to
                buffer the adjacent farm lands from the urbanizable land within the UGB
                consistent with the intent of this goal. Based on the information contained within
                this report and facts and findings in support of the proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments the City has conducted the planning process in compliance with
                statewide planning goal 3.

Goal 4: Forest Lands
To conserve forest lands by maintaining the forest land base and to protect the state's forest
economy by making possible economically efficient forest practices that assure the continuous
growing and harvesting of forest tree species as the leading use on forest land consistent with
sound management of soil, air, water, and fish and wildlife resources and to provide for
recreational opportunities and agriculture.

Finding:        The proposed amendments do not impact existing forest land and are therefore
                consistent with statewide planning goal 4.

Goal 5: Natural Resources, Scenic and Historic Resources, and Open Space
To protect natural resources and conserve scenic and historic areas and open spaces.

Finding:        The proposed amendments concern the 345 acres that was added to the City’s
                UGB in 2014 including amending the comprehensive plan map to designate
                these properties appropriately for future development. The proposed
                amendments include changes to the City’s utility master plans, transportation
                system plan and parks master plan to identify improvements necessary to
                support the development of these new lands. The City has designated Council
                Creek, the Tualatin River and their associated tributaries as Goal 5 resources
                within the comprehensive plan and enacted a Natural Resource Overlay (NRO)
                zone to protect the resources. The City works closely with CWS to administer the
                natural resource protections within the community and there is a development
                process in place to ensure that these resources will be protected and when
                appropriate enhanced. The proposed ordinances (Exhibit A and B) dictate that
                prior to annexation wetland determination completed by a qualified professional
                in order to ascertain the potential presence of wetlands. If potential wetland
                resources are identified during the annexation process, prior to development of a
                site the applicant will be required to submit a wetland delineation that has been
                concurred with by the Oregon Department of State Lands.

                No scenic or historic resources were identified within the 2014 UGB planning
                process, accordingly no resources are proposed to be added to the City’s
                inventory. New parks are identified for development within the UGB and open
                space areas are planned for preservation within the parks master plan consistent
                with the intent of this goal. Based on the information contained within this report
                and facts and findings in support of the proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments the City has conducted the planning process in compliance with
                statewide planning goal 5.


Goal 6: Air, Water and Land Resources Quality
To maintain and improve the quality of the air, water and land resources of the state.

Finding:        The City has demonstrated how sanitary sewer and stormwater services can be
                provided to support development of the 2014 UGB. Council Creek, the Tualatin
                River and their associated tributaries are identified as Goal 5 resources within the
                comprehensive plan. Future development will need to comply with the provisions
                of the City’s Natural Resource Overlay (NRO) as well as the requirements

                                                                                         October 5, 2015
                administered in part by CWS. These process will assure that development that
                occurs within the 2014 UGB does not degrade the water quality of the adjacent
                resources, in fact CWS and NRO requirements will mandate improvements to the
                existing vegetated corridor associated with these resources resulting in a net
                increase in the quality of the resources consistent with the intent of this goal. The
                City’s TSP will guide development of lands within the UGB resulting in an
                interconnected transportation system that provides for all modes of travel,
                including increased pedestrian and bicycle connections and facilities. The
                comprehensive plan amendments and Cornelius City Code will result in efficient
                development of the land within the 2014 UGB reducing the need to extend the
                UGB in the future consistent with the intent of this goal. Based on the information
                contained within this report and fact and findings in support of the proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments the City has conducted the planning process
                in compliance with statewide planning goal 6.

Goal 7: Areas Subject to Natural Hazards
To protect people and property from natural hazards.

Finding:        The 2014 UGB was delineated in part based upon the Federal Emergency
                Management Agency (FEMA) mapped floodplains associated with Council
                Creek, the Tualatin River and their associated tributaries. The result is that those
                areas mapped within the 100 year floodplain for these resources have been left
                out of the UGB, thus not permitting future urban development within the
                floodplains, one of the areas subject to natural hazards within western
                Washington County. The City of Cornelius Comprehensive Plan, the Cornelius
                City Code, the International Building Code and the International Fire Code all
                work together to ensure that future development within the 2014 UGB will be
                designed, permitted and constructed consistent with statewide planning goal 7.

Goal 8: Recreational Needs
To satisfy the recreational needs of the citizens of the state and visitors and, where appropriate,
to provide for the siting of necessary recreational facilities including destination resorts.

Finding:        Both the NE 2014 UGB and SE 2014 UGB areas were considered when the City
                of Cornelius developed the 2009 City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan. The
                proposed amendments to the parks master plan seek to add the Council Creek
                Trail Master Plan resulting in a planned facility that will provide additional
                recreation opportunities for the immediate community as well visitors and guests.
                The proposed amendment to reduce the planned park from a Community Park to
                a Neighborhood Park within the NE UGB area reflects the low-density residential
                development that is proposed to occur within this area. The proposal to remove a
                planned aspirational pathway that is located outside of the UGB on private land
                reflects the fact that this area is unlikely to ever be included within the UGB as
                well as the fact the property owners do not want it there. The proposed
                amendments to the parks master plan better reflect the needs of the community
                and are therefore consistent with statewide planning goal 8.

Goal 9: Economic Development
To provide adequate opportunities throughout the state for a variety of economic activities vital
to the health, welfare, and prosperity of Oregon's citizens.

Finding:        The City is located within the Metro Regional Boundary and is therefore not
                required to comply with statewide planning goal 9. As a member of Metro, the
                entire housing and employment needs of the area are collectively examined and
                guided to the benefit of the region as a whole. As such the City does not have an
                acknowledged Economic Opportunity Analysis. The City is proposing to
                designate a parcel in the NE UGB south of the TV Highway as commercial. This
                site is situated adjacent existing commercial development, and it is of adequate
                size and configuration to permit highway commercial development. This property
                will provide the opportunity for future commercial development and
                corresponding employment consistent with the intent of this goal.

                Additional areas within the NE UGB north of the TV Highway were requested to
                be designated commercial by a group of property owners. This was analyzed
                during the planning process, City Staff ultimately decided that these areas were
                not appropriate for commercial designation for a variety of reasons: the City
                already has existing vacant commercial property within the downtown and along
                the TV Highway corridor; there are significant amounts of commercial land within
                the City that are currently underutilized such as the Grande Foods site and Fred
                Meyer site; and the NE UGB (north of the highway) is already parcelized and
                developed as low-density residential. The proposed amendments are consistent
                with statewide goal 9.

Goal 10: Housing
To provide for the housing needs of citizens of the state.

Finding:        Similar to goal 9, the City does not need to demonstrate compliance with
                statewide planning goal 10 as it is located within Metro. The vast majority of the
                land include within the 2014 UGB is proposed to be designated low- or medium-
                density residential, the only exception is the approximately 7 acre parcel located
                in the NE UGB south of the TV Highway that is proposed to be designated
                commercial due its location and size.

                Later on in this report are findings that detail how the proposed comprehensive
                plan amendments comply with Metropolitan Housing Rule, exceeding the
                minimum density dictated by the state of Oregon for the City of Cornelius. As
                noted previously the City has an adequate supply of commercially designated
                land within the community that is either vacant or underdeveloped. The City also
                has good supply of industrial land that is either vacant or underdeveloped. The
                majority of the existing industrial land is located within two distinct areas of the
                community. The first is located in the NW corner of the City, the second is
                located in the SE corner of the City. These areas are ideally situated within the
                community to take advantage of access to Highway 26 and avoid potential
                conflicts between industrial and non-industrial uses.

                The NE UGB is already committed to low-density residential development. While
                there are some larger parcels that could be developed with a commercial or

                                                                                         October 5, 2015
                industrial use, these parcels are either located too far from the highway corridor,
                oriented awkwardly and/or are surrounded by existing residential development.
                Accordingly the NE UGB is proposed to be designated primarily low-density
                residential. The existing manufactured home park is proposed to be designated
                medium-density residential to reflect the existing development and is proposed to
                be zone Manufactured Home Park upon annexation.

                The SE UGB is comprised mostly of vacant large lots that are used for
                agricultural purposes. This area is relatively flat and could be developed with
                commercial and/or industrial uses. The question is whether this area is
                appropriate for this type of development and whether the City needs additional
                industrial and/or commercial land. Staff concluded that the location of the SE
                UGB was not appropriate for commercial and industrial development due to its
                distance from the TV Highway and Highway 26 corridors. There was also
                concern regarding the compatibility with existing development within the City.
                The city currently has a limited amount of developable residential land and Staff
                determined the SE UGB area was most appropriately designated as residential.
                The proposed mixture of low- and medium-density residential provides
                opportunities for a range of housing options while still maintaining compatibility
                with adjacent urban development and rural farm practices. The proposed
                amendments provide for a range of housing development to meet the City’s
                needs consistent with the intent of statewide goal 10.

Goal 11: Public Facilities and Services
To plan and develop a timely, orderly and efficient arrangement of public facilities and services to
serve as a framework for urban and rural development.

Finding:        The proposed comprehensive plan amendments are intended to guide the future
                development of land added to the UGB in 2014. Statewide goal 11 mandates that
                Cities plan for public facilities and services necessary to support the intended
                development. The proposed water, sewer, storm and transportation related
                amendments were sized to accommodate the level of development anticipated
                from the proposed comprehensive plan amendments. The transportation system
                plan is proposed to be amended to identify improvements necessary to mitigate
                the impacts associated with the reasonably worst case development scenario.
                Likewise the parks, water and sanitary sewer master plans are proposed to be
                amended to include improvements that are necessary to support the full build out
                of the UGB. By identifying these improvements and associated costs the City can
                plan for the provision of these services including but not limited to updating the
                City’s corresponding system development charges (SDC’s) to assure that
                adequate revenue is collected to provide for the improvements needed within the
                UGB.

                Identifying the correct improvements and determining when the improvements will
                need to occur provides the City the ability to effectively manage future annexations
                and development requests and ensure that services are available in a timely
                manner. Knowing the ultimate sanitary sewer and or water improvement that is
                necessary for the full build out of the UGB also allows the City to provide services
                efficiently, reducing the need to replace facilities in the future to accommodate

                                                                                        October 5, 2015
                continued development. This process also provides the community the ability to
                understand the actual costs of providing the services to determine if alternative
                funding mechanisms such as supplemental SDC’s or tax increment financing are
                necessary to support service delivery.

                The proposed comprehensive plan amendments anticipate the level of
                development that could occur within the UGB given the proposed comprehensive
                plan designation and corresponding zoning upon annexation. The amendments
                identify improvements necessary to support the development of the UGB. The
                process provides the City, the development community and residents an
                understanding of what improvements will need to occur, as well as, when and how
                those improvements will occur. The proposed amendments to the comprehensive
                plan are consistent with consistent with statewide goal 11.

Goal 12: Transportation
To provide and encourage a safe, convenient and economic transportation system

Finding:        The City contracted with DKS and Associates to prepare a transportation analysis
                to determine the improvements necessary to provide for the development of the
                new lands added to the UGB in 2014. DKS analyzed the vehicular, pedestrian,
                bicyclist and transit system within their transportation analysis. The analysis
                contained with Exhibit G identifies specific improvements necessary to mitigate the
                effects of the full build out of the UGB as well as recommendations for how to
                manage the development of the UGB to minimize impacts on existing
                development. Within this report are detailed findings demonstrating how the
                proposed comprehensive plan and comprehensive plan map amendments comply
                with the applicable transportation requirements of the state (Transportation
                Planning Rule) as well as the region (Metro). The transportation system that will
                serve the NE UGB utilizes existing roadways to accommodate the projected
                development of the area. As properties are annexed and proposed for
                development frontage and corridor improvements will be required as part of the
                land use review process. No new transportation facilities are planned for outside
                of the existing UGB. The proposed amendments address the requirements of
                statewide planning goal 12.

Goal 13: Energy Conservation
To conserve energy.

Finding:        The intent of this goal is to promote development and utilization of land within the
                UGB that conserves energy. Many of the specific implementation measures are
                targeted at code requirements that implement the comprehensive plan, such as lot
                size, building height, setbacks, and access to light, wind and air. The City is not
                proposing to alter the Cornelius City Code which has been acknowledged to be
                consistent with goal 13. This goal can be considered as part of the decision on
                what comprehensive plan designation to apply within the UGB, balanced of course
                with the other statewide planning goals. The proposed designation within the SE
                and NE area were arrived at after balancing the desires of the community, the

                                                                                        October 5, 2015
                needs of the City and the requirements put in place by the state, region and the
                City.

                While the NE UGB could have been proposed to be designated a higher residential
                density, this would have been inconsistent with the existing development pattern,
                as proposed, the designations will allow for additional density while respecting the
                existing low density residential development pattern.

                The proposed designation within the SE area have been designed to respect
                existing development while also providing the opportunity for higher density
                consistent with the intent of this goal. Services for water, stormwater, and sanitary
                sewer will be designed and located to maximize the efficient delivery of these
                services thereby reducing the cost to construct and maintain resulting in less
                consumption of energy. Similarly the transportation system will be designed and
                constructed to provide for direct connections and minimize out-of-direction travel.
                New facilities for pedestrians and bicyclist will be incorporated as part of the design
                providing for non-motorized connections to the existing City Limits and transit stops
                along the TV Highway. Therefore the proposed comprehensive plan amendments
                are consistent with statewide planning goal 13.

Goal 14: Urbanization
To provide for an orderly and efficient transition from rural to urban land use, to accommodate
urban population and urban employment inside urban growth boundaries, to ensure efficient use
of land, and to provide for livable communities.

Finding:        The primary purpose of goal 14 is to establish and manage urban growth
                boundaries within the state of Oregon. The proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments do not result in the establishment of a new UGB, nor do the
                amendments propose to alter the City of Cornelius UGB. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments will result in applying comprehensive plan map
                designations to land that was included within the UGB in 2014. The proposed
                designations include commercial, low-density residential and medium-density
                residential.

                The majority of the NE UGB is already committed to urban level development as
                witnessed by the zoning and development pattern that exists. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments will allow for future development of the majority
                of this area as low-density residential, respecting the existing development pattern
                and the wishes of the citizens who reside there. One parcel located south TV
                Highway is proposed to be designated commercial to reflect the existing
                development pattern along the south side of the highway. One parcel located along
                the western edge of the area is proposed to be designated medium-density
                residential to reflect existing development which is a mobile home park, this
                property would be zoned Mobile Home Park (MHP) upon annexation.

                The majority of the SE area is currently undeveloped and is characterized by rural
                residential development on large lots and farming activities. The majority of this
                area is proposed to be designated medium-density residential, with two specific

                                                                                           October 5, 2015
                areas proposed to be designated low-density residential. Along the east of the SE
                UGB the low-density residential is proposed to serve as a buffer along with SW
                345th Avenue between existing farmlands to the east. Similar the proposed
                amendments identify a buffer of low-density residential along the southern and
                eastern boundary of the existing City Limits, this is to ensure that development
                adjacent the existing City Limits keeps in scale with existing development. The
                proposed land use pattern within the SE UGB allows for efficient use of the land
                consistent with the intent of this goal while also respecting existing farm practices
                and existing development within the City.

                The proposed amendments do not propose to establish or alter a UGB. The
                proposed amendments do identify and plan for the provision of urban services
                necessary to support development of the subject areas and allow for future
                annexation into the City. These amendments do propose to apply comprehensive
                plan designations and urban services that will result in efficient development, while
                at the same time respecting the transition of the UGB and the redevelopment of
                areas that are already committed to low density residential. The proposed
                amendments are therefore consistent with statewide planning goal 14.

Goal 15: Willamette River Greenway
To protect, conserve, enhance and maintain the natural, scenic, historical, agricultural, economic
and recreational qualities of lands along the Willamette River as the Willamette River Greenway.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located along the Willamette River. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments do impact the Willamette River Greenway,
                therefore, the goal 15 is not applicable to this review.

Goal 16: Estuarine Resources
To recognize and protect the unique environmental, economic, and social values of each estuary
and associated wetlands; and To protect, maintain, where appropriate develop, and where
appropriate restore the long-term environmental, economic, and social values, diversity and
benefits of Oregon's estuaries.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no estuarine resources
                associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, therefore, goal
                16 is not applicable to this review

Goal 17: Coastal Shorelands
To conserve, protect, where appropriate, develop and where appropriate restore the resources
and benefits of all coastal shorelands, recognizing their value for protection and maintenance of
water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, water-dependent uses, economic resources and recreation
and aesthetics. The management of these shoreland areas shall be compatible with the
characteristics of the adjacent coastal waters; and To reduce the hazard to human life and
property, and the adverse effects upon water quality and fish and wildlife habitat, resulting from
the use and enjoyment of Oregon’s coastal shorelands.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no coastal shorelands
                associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, therefore, goal
                17 is not applicable to this review

Goal 18: Beaches and Dunes
To conserve, protect, where appropriate develop, and where appropriate restore the resources
and benefits of coastal beach and dune areas; and to reduce the hazard to human life and
property from natural or man-induced actions associated with these areas.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no beach or dune
                resources associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments,
                therefore, goal 18 is not applicable to this review

Goal 19: Ocean Resources
To conserve marine resources and ecological functions for the purpose of providing long-term
ecological, economic, and social value and benefits to future generations.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no ocean resources
                associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, therefore, goal
                19 is not applicable to this review.



METRO TITLE 11 ANALYSIS
3.07.1120 PLANNING FOR AREAS ADDED TO THE UGB
A. The county or city responsible for comprehensive planning of an area, as specified by the
intergovernmental agreement adopted pursuant to section 3.07.1110C(7) or the ordinance that
added the area to the UGB, shall adopt comprehensive plan provisions and land use regulations
for the area to address the requirements of subsection C by the date specified by the ordinance
or by section 3.07.1455B(4) of this chapter.

Finding:        The subject properties were added to the City of Cornelius Urban Growth
                Boundary (UGB) by the State of Oregon by House Bill 4078. The City is therefore
                responsible for the comprehensive planning of the area. The City is proposing to
                adopt amendments to the Cornelius Comprehensive Plan to provide guidance on
                how the properties can be developed and served upon annexation into the City.
                The proposed comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with this provision.

B. If the concept plan developed for the area pursuant to section 3.07.1110 assigns planning
responsibility to more than one city or county, the responsible local governments shall provide for
concurrent consideration and adoption of proposed comprehensive plan provisions unless the
ordinance adding the area to the UGB provides otherwise.

Finding:        There is no corresponding concept plan for the subject properties. As noted above
                the areas were added into the City’s UGB through a state legislative action (HB
                4078). The responsible local government is the City of Cornelius. The City of
                Cornelius is proposing specific comprehensive plan amendments to provide

                guidance on how the properties can be developed and served upon annexation
                into the City. The proposed comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with
                this provision.

C. Comprehensive plan provisions for the area shall include:
      1. Specific plan designation boundaries derived from and generally consistent with the
      boundaries of design type designations assigned by the Metro Council in the ordinance
      adding the area to the UGB;

Finding:        The two areas, referred to as the 2014 SE UGB and 2014 NE UGB were defined
                by Metro (see Exhibits I and J) after the passage of House Bill 4078. The City is
                proposing specific amendments to the comprehensive plan to guide future
                development of these areas. In addition, the City is also proposing to acknowledge
                the Council Creek Regional Trail Plan (Exhibit H) as a component of the 2009 City
                of Cornelius Parks Master Plan (component of the comprehensive plan). Both the
                CCRTP and 2014 UGB amendments are intended to guide future development
                within the City of Cornelius UGB consistent with the intent of this criterion.

        2. Provision for annexation to a city and to any necessary service districts prior to, or
        simultaneously with, application of city land use regulations intended to comply with this
        subsection;

Finding:        Once the proposed amendments are completed and in effect, the City can process
                annexations from the 2014 UGB areas, provided each property meets the City’s
                annexation requirements detailed on Page 16 of the Comprehensive Plan. Upon
                annexation the City will apply the appropriate zoning, including the Natural
                Resource Overlay (NRO) zone for those properties that adjacent Council Creek,
                the Tualatin River and the associated tributaries.

        3. Provisions that ensure zoned capacity for the number and types of housing units, if any,
        specified by the Metro Council pursuant to section 3.07.1455B(2) of this chapter;

Finding:        Section 3.07.1455B(2) relates to a conditions of approval that are typically placed
                on properties during “concept planning” prior to inclusion within the UGB. As noted
                above the properties were added to the UGB through a legislative process at the
                state level. No specific requirements or conditions of approval were placed on the
                UGB expansion at that time. No specific conditions of approval were placed on the
                UGB expansion by the Metro Council. Therefore the criterion identified above is
                not applicable to this review.

        4. Provision for affordable housing consistent with Title 7 of this chapter if the
        comprehensive plan authorizes housing in any part of the area.

Finding:        Detailed findings demonstrating conformance with Title 7 are provided below with
                this report.

        5. Provision for the amount of land and improvements needed, if any, for public school
        facilities sufficient to serve the area added to the UGB in coordination with affected school
        districts. This Effective 09/10/14 3.07 - 64 of 129 requirement includes consideration of
        any school facility plan prepared in accordance with ORS 195.110;

Finding:        The City is served by two school districts, the Hillsboro School District (HSD) and
                Forest Grove School District (FGSD). The City worked closely with both districts
                to determine if there was the need for additional school property at the beginning
                of the planning process. The majority of the area added to the UGB in 2014 is
                within the HSD, with a small portion in the southwest area of the UGB located
                within the FGSD.

                The HSD owns approximately 41 acres within the 2014 SE UGB area. This area
                is of sufficient size to accommodate a High School, Middle School, Elementary
                School or a combination Middle/Elementary School. Based on interviews with HSD
                staff, the district does not need additional land to support the anticipated growth.
                The FGSD has existing capacity within their district to be able serve their portion
                of the 2014 SE UGB. Schools are permitted as a conditional use in the R-7, R-10,
                and A-2 zones. The proposed amendments account for the future needs of the
                HSD and FGSD consistent with this criterion.

        6. Provision for the amount of land and improvements needed, if any, for public park
        facilities sufficient to serve the area added to the UGB in coordination with affected park
        providers.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is the park provider for our UGB. The proposed amendments
                to the UGB include revisions to the 2009 City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan. The
                revised plan calls for a Neighborhood Park in the 2014 NE UGB as well as several
                linear open space areas that will provide connections to the Tualatin River and
                Council Creek corridors. The proposed amendments also provide for the formal
                acknowledgement of the Council Creek Region Trail Plan as a component of the
                comprehensive plan.

        7. A conceptual street plan that identifies internal street connections and connections to
        adjacent urban areas to improve local access and improve the integrity of the regional
        street system. For areas that allow residential or mixed-use development, the plan shall
        meet the standards for street connections in the Regional Transportation Functional Plan;

Finding:        The majority of the area brought into the UGB in 2014 is intended for residential
                development. The City contracted with DKS and Associates to analyze the
                transportation system. Exhibit G is a technical memorandum that identifies the
                approximate location of new collector roadways and intersection improvements
                that will be necessary to support the development of both areas added to the UGB,
                this serves as the conceptual street plan required. The design and location of local
                streets will be determined at the time of development. City Staff will require designs
                that are consistent with Title 17 (Subdivision Ordinance) and 18.143 of the
                Cornelius City Code which mandate compliance with Title 1 of Section 3.08.110 of
                the Regional Transportation Functional Plan.

                Specifically all sidewalks constructed within the new UGB areas will be a minimum
                of five (5) feet in width. The City does permit and encourage local streets to be
                constructed with pavement widths less than 28 feet in width. City standards require
                street trees located within a landscape planter area that is a minimum of five (5)
                feet in width. City standards permit the use of traffic calming devices such as speed
                bumps, curb extensions and chicanes. At the time of development these standards
                will be assured consistent this requirement.

        8. Provision for the financing of local and state public facilities and services; and

Finding:        The proposed comprehensive plan amendments include revisions to the City’s
                parks, utility and transportation master plans to support the proposed
                comprehensive plan map designations within Exhibit I and J. For each new facility
                required to serve the new UGB appropriate funding has been identified. Due to the
                size and scale of the infrastructure necessary to support development of the 2014
                UGB no supplemental SDC’s or alternative funding mechanisms are necessary. A
                combination of existing SDC’s and development exactions will suffice to ensure
                that improvements can be completed when they are needed. The City has been
                working diligently with CWS and Washington County to ensure that key
                infrastructure improvements are identified within the appropriate capital
                improvement plans to ensure these improvements are SDC creditable. The two
                largest improvements; 1.) The sanitary sewer pump station for the SE UGB, and
                2.) The 29th Street intersection and corridor extension are both SDC creditable. In
                fact the 29th Street project has been identified within the City’s TSP since 2005.
                The remaining improvements including the extension of the sanitary system,
                extension of the water system, development of the stormwater system, and
                development of the parks system will be completed through a combination of
                development exactions and utilizing funds collected through SDC’s. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments have considered the need for financing and
                determined adequate measures exist to provide for the identified services
                consistent with this requirement.

        9. A strategy for protection of the capacity and function of state highway interchanges,
        including existing and planned interchanges and planned improvements to interchanges.

Finding:        The City does not have any state highway interchanges or planned interchanges
                located within the UGB. Therefore the proposed amendments to the
                comprehensive plan are consistent with this requirement.

D. The county or city responsible for comprehensive planning of an area shall submit to Metro a
determination of the residential capacity of any area zoned to allow dwelling units, using the
method in section 3.07.120, within 30 days after adoption of new land use regulations for the area.
Finding:        The City shall comply with this requirement, detailed findings demonstrating
                compliance with the applicable portions of Title 7 are set forth below.

TITLE 7: HOUSING CHOICE
3.07.730 REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND IMPLEMENTING
ORDINANCE CHANGES
Cities and counties within the Metro region shall ensure that their comprehensive plans and
implementing ordinances:
        A. Include strategies to ensure a diverse range of housing types within their jurisdictional
        boundaries.

Finding:        The proposed amendments do not include changes to the implementing
                ordinance. The Cornelius City Code has previously been acknowledged by the
                state of Oregon. The City provides the opportunity for a diverse range of housing
                within each of our residential zones. The proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments result in a mixture of low- and medium-density residential land that
                can accommodate wide range of housing options including apartments, attached
                single family housing, accessory dwellings, and detached single family housing.
                The City’s Planned Unit Development ordinance permits flexibility in housing type,
                lot size, setbacks and many other development standards. The City recently
                approved a nonprofit low-income housing tax exemption (Section 3.35 of the
                Cornelius City Code) to encourage the development of affordable housing within
                the community. The minimum density requirements of the implementing zones will
                also assure a diverse range of housing types is provided within the community.
                The proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan do not seek to alter any of
                these strategies, rather the amendments seek to allow for the development of
                additional residential development within the community via the adoption of
                amendments to the utility master plans and the comprehensive plan map
                consistent with this section of Title 7.

        B. Include in their plans actions and implementation measures designed to maintain the
        existing supply of affordable housing as well as increase the opportunities for new
        dispersed affordable housing within their boundaries.

Finding:        The City is not proposing to amend any of the implementing ordinances for the
                comprehensive plan. However, the City did adopt a nonprofit corporation low-
                income housing tax exemption (Chapter 3.35 of the Cornelius City Code) in an
                effort to increase the provision of affordable housing within the community. The
                City is proposing to designate a mix of low- and medium-density residential land
                on the comprehensive plan map that would provide the opportunity for additional
                affordable housing to be developed within the community.

                All of the City’s residential zones permit the development of accessory dwellings.
                The SE UGB in particular will have a significant amount of medium-density
                designated land that will ultimately be zoned A-2, Multi-family upon annexation into
                the City. The A-2 zone allows for a wide range of housing types including
                apartments, townhomes, attached single family and detached single family homes.
                The minimum lot size for a single family detached home in the A-2 is 3,100 sq. ft.
                and it is 3,000 sq. ft. for attached products. The smaller lot size allows for a more
                affordable home by reducing the size of the lot of, thereby reducing the cost of the
                home. The R-7 zone allows for attached and detached single family homes.

                The proposed amendments would not limit or reduce the City’s ability to maintain
                and/or increase the affordable housing supplied within the community. In contrast
                the proposed amendments would provide additional land where a variety of new
                housing could be constructed consistent with the intent of this section of Title 7.

        C. Include plan policies, actions, and implementation measures aimed at increasing
        opportunities for households of all income levels to live within their individual jurisdictions
        in affordable housing.

Finding:        As detailed above the City is not proposing to remove and/or alter any policies or
                implementing measures. The City has measures in place to promote the provision
                of affordable housing within the community. The City is lacking land available for
                development of affordable housing. The proposed amendments to the
                comprehensive plan would result in plan designations that would be supportive of
                this section of Title 7 by providing additional land within the City’s residential
                inventory that could be developed with affordable housing opportunities in the
                future.



METROPOLITAN HOUSING RULE
660-007-0035

MINIMUM RESIDENTIAL DENSITY ALLOCATION FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION
The following standards shall apply to those jurisdictions which provide the opportunity for at least
50 percent of new residential units to be attached single family housing or multiple family housing:
        (1) The Cities of Cornelius, Durham, Fairview, Happy Valley and Sherwood must provide
        for an overall density of six or more dwelling units per net buildable acre. These are
        relatively small cities with some growth potential (i.e. with a regionally coordinated
        population projection of less than 8,000 persons for the active planning area).

Finding:        The City of Cornelius allows for attached single family housing in the R-10, R-7
                and A-2 zones providing the opportunity for approximately 95 percent of new
                residential units within the 2014 UGB to be attached single family or multiple family.
                The only zone that precludes attached single family housing is the Manufactured
                Home Park (MHP) zone. Therefore, the City of Cornelius minimum overall density
                shall be six dwelling units per net developable acre. The Cornelius City Code
                and/or Comprehensive Plan define the net buildable acres for each zone. The City
                is proposing to designate 173 acres of low-density residential (R-7 and R-10) and
                186 acres of medium-density residential (A-2 and MHP) resulting in an average
                minimum density of 7.36 dwelling units per net acre for the planning areas. The
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments exceed the standard.

Finding:            In support of the proposed comprehensive plan map amendments the City
                    engaged DKS and Associates to analyze the transportation system and provide a
                    formal recommendation to ensure that the proposed comprehensive plan map
                    amendments (Exhibits I and J) comply with the Oregon Transportation Planning
                    Rule (OAR 660-012-0060). DKS coordinated with ODOT and Washington County
                    prior to conducting the study to identify the appropriate scope of work to
                    complete this review. DKS’s analysis is included within Exhibit G of this report.
                    The traffic analysis completed for the proposed Cornelius UGB expansion areas
                    found the potential vehicle trip increase would not significantly impact the
                    surrounding transportation system and would satisfy the requirements of OAR
                    660-012-0060. No capacity improvements to existing facilities beyond those
                    identified in the RTP and Cornelius TSP are required to support the UGB
                    expansion areas. DKS did suggest that further analysis of Tualatin Valley
                    Highway west of SW 345th Avenue should be included in the upcoming Cornelius
                    TSP update to identify specific projects to serve fronting property needs for
                    access, capacity and safety. City staff have included this recommendation within
                    the scope of work for the upcoming TSP update.

CORNELIUS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN LAND USE PLANNING

Amending the Plan
It is the City's intent to give the citizens and affected governmental units’ ample opportunity to
review and comment on any proposed plan changes. There are several types of amendments
that may occur over time. They include:
         • Periodic Review, as required by state law, every 7-10 years.
         • Plan Text amendments, which alter the policies of the plan.
         • Plan Map amendments, which alter the land use designation and/or density of a specific
         property or group of properties.
         • Amendments may be major or minor in nature:
                 * Major amendments (Legislative) include land use changes that have widespread
                 and significant impact beyond the immediate area or an individual parcel. These
                 include quantitative changes producing large volumes of traffic; qualitative
                 changes in the character of the land use itself such as conversion of residential to
                 industrial use; or spatial changes that affect large areas or many different
                 ownerships. A complete rethinking of the plan and the needs of the public may be
                 necessary before major amendments are approved.
                 * Minor amendments (Quasi-judicial) have little significance beyond the immediate
                 area of the change. Their evaluation will be based on special studies or other
                 information which justifies the public need for the change.


Procedures
Amendments may be initiated by the City Council, Planning Commission, city staff, or a 11
property owner, or group of owners. The amendment shall be initiated through a formal application
process. All amendments shall include specific recommendations or requests from the applicant,
supported by factual documentation as to why the amendment is necessary and appropriate. A
staff report shall be prepared and presented to the Planning Commission.

Finding:        The City Council initiated the amendments that are the subject of this report.

Public hearings shall be held before any amendment is approved. There shall first be a review by
the Planning Commission, which may also include informal public meetings or workshops, but
shall conclude in a public hearing. The Commission shall make a formal recommendation to the
City Council. The City Council shall then also hold a public hearing before making a final decision
to amend the Plan. Any amendment shall be adopted by ordinance.

Finding:        The planning commission is scheduled to hold a public hearing on October 13th
                and the City Council is scheduled to host a public hearing in November. The
                proposed amendments are contained within Ordinance 2015-06 and 2015-07. The
                proposed amendments are consistent with this section of the comprehensive plan.

                                                                                         October 5, 2015
Notice of Amendments
For minor amendments (quasi-judicial) applying to individual parcels or small local areas a public
hearing on the proposed change will be held, and at least 20 working days of notice prior to the
hearing will be given to all owners, including the subject site, and within 250 feet of a specific
property boundary for which a change is proposed.

Finding:        The proposed package of amendments is not quasi-judicial, the amendments
                encompass approximately 345 acres and numerous property owners. The notice
                requirement detailed above is not applicable to this review.

For major amendments (legislative) applying to large areas or effecting general policies of the
plan notice shall be given to all property owners within the City limits by publication in a newspaper
of general circulation in the City. Such notice shall be provided, at least 20 days prior to the first
hearing.

Finding:        The City posted notice of the first hearing 21 days prior to the first hearing before
                the planning commission in the Forest Grove News Times. Notice was posted on
                September 23rd, 2015 for the October 13th, 2015 hearing. As detailed above the
                City also provided direct mailed notice to those interested parties who participated
                in the planning process. The proposed amendments exceed the minimum notice
                requirement set forth above.

For all amendments notice shall be provided to interested and effected public agencies, with
specific notice to METRO and DLCD, at least 45 days prior to the first hearing, as provided under
ORS 197.610 and OAR Chapter 660, Division 18.

Finding:        The City provided notice to affected agencies pursuant to ORS 197.610.


Criteria
The following criteria shall be used to establish whether or not a plan amendment or change is
justified. An amendment need not satisfy each and every one of the criteria, but the city must
conclude that at least some of the criteria have been reasonably addressed.

        • The fact that an applicant owns the land for which the change is being sought is not in
        itself sufficient justification for the change or amendment.

Finding:        The proposed comprehensive plan amendments were initiated by the City Council
                and not specifically proposed by an individual property owner.

        • The proposed change or amendment must meet a public need. Such need must be
        documented by appropriate facts and evidence and should extend from the statewide
        planning goals, METRO 2040, or the city own comprehensive plan.

                                                                                          October 5, 2015
Finding:        The public need that proposed amendments are meeting has been documented
                throughout this report. The proposed amendments are intended to guide the
                development of approximately 345 acres that was added to the City’s UGB in 2014.
                There is a lack of residential land available for development within the City without
                the proposed amendments, areas added to the UGB in 2014 will be unable to
                annex into the City and meet the demand for residential development within the
                community.

        • The amendment is necessary to conform with current state law or regional 12 policy,
        which requires local compliance.

Finding:        The amendments proposed are not necessary to comply with current state law or
                regional 12 policy. The amendments are necessary to provide guidance for the
                development of land that was added to the UGB in 2014. Failure to approve the
                amendments will prevent property located within the new UGB from being able to
                annex to the City and develop. There is a demonstrated need for the additional
                land to provide new housing opportunities for the community.

        • The amendment is necessary to implement the adopted vision for the community, or to
        respond to unanticipated local circumstances.

Finding:        The proposed amendments are necessary to allow for annexation and
                development of land added to the City’s UGB in 2014. The community has sought
                to include portions of these lands within UGB for some time, this desire is reflected
                in the City’s current TSP which identifies improvements within the SE UGB as well
                as the City’s parks master plan which identifies improvements within both the NE
                and SE UGB. Both of these plans were adopted and acknowledged as part of the
                City’s comprehensive plan reflecting the community’s vision for these areas.
                Without approval of the proposed comprehensive plan amendments the vision
                articulated within the plan cannot be realized. The amendments are also necessary
                to respond to an unanticipated local circumstance that resulted from addition of
                land to the City’s UGB in 2014 as approved by the state legislature and signed into
                law by the governor. The proposal is consistent with these criteria.

        • The proposed change or amendment must be in conformance with the unamended goals
        and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, as well as being consistent with state and
        regional policies.

Finding:        This report has documented how the proposed amendments are consistent with
                the statewide planning goals, the applicable provisions of the Metro’s policy, the
                applicable Oregon administrative rules as well as the applicable portions of the
                City’s comprehensive plan and the Cornelius City Code.

        • The amendment must meet the standards and requirements of the zone in which it is
        located, or proposed to be located.

Finding:        The proposed comprehensive plan amendments provide comprehensive plan map
                designations for properties added to the UGB in 2014. The proposed amendments
                also adopt amendments to the City’s parks and utility master plans (components
                of the comprehensive plan) intended to provide services to and guide the
                development of these newly added lands. Zoning will be applied to each individual
                property as part of the annexation process under a separate land use action.


CHAPTER V HOUSING
Goal: To provide for the housing needs of the prospective as well as the present Cornelius
      citizens

        Policies:
        1. Ensure that adequate land is available for both single family and multi-family housing
        2. Promote and encourage housing types and densities throughout town, available at
            various prices and rents, to households of all incomes, age, sex and race.
        3. Promote and encourage open spaces and buffers in new subdivisions and other
            housing developments.
        4. Develop strategies for promoting higher end housing options.

Finding:        The proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan and map primarily
                provide for the housing needs of the community ensuring that adequate land is
                available for both single and multi-family development. Approximately 173 acres
                of low-density residential land (R-7 and R-10) and 186 acres of medium-density
                residential land (A-2 and MHP) are proposed to be designated within the 2014
                UGB, resulting in the application of all the existing zones as part the
                amendments. The diversity of proposed map designations will promote the
                development of a mix of housing types and densities providing a range of rents
                and prices. The proposed map amendments within the SE UGB include a
                transition in density with respect to the existing City Limits and UGB which
                effectively buffers the new development from existing housing developments to
                ensure compatibility. The proposed amendments are consistent with Chapter V
                of the comprehensive plan.


CHAPTER VIII             PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
Goal: To plan and develop the necessary recreational, transportation, and public facility
systems and services to meet the needs of the Cornelius residents.

        Policies:
        1. The City shall coordinate with the school districts for efficient expansion or
            development of new schools and facilities.
        2. The City shall provide opportunities in the zoning code for alternative and private
            schools.
        3. The City shall encourage development of local recreation options.
        4. The City shall continue to maintain an adequate water supply and to improve the
            overall water distribution system.
        5. The City shall coordinate with USA, Metro, and Washington County on the planning
            management of sewage and solid waste.

Finding:        Both the Forest Grove and Hillsboro school districts were engaged in the
                planning process at the onset as part of the stakeholder interviews. The
                Community Development Director currently and historically has been an active
                member of the Hillsboro School District’s Long Range Planning Committee,
                attending monthly meetings and providing updates on new development and long
                range planning projects in the City. The proposed amendments include new trail
                improvements that will result in recreation opportunities within the community
                when developed. The proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan include
                analysis of the City’s water system and identify improvements necessary to
                support development of the 2014 UGB. Metro, CWS (formerly USA) and
                Washington County were all engaged in the planning process as members of the
                Technical Advisory Committee. The proposed comprehensive plan and map
                amendments are consistent with Chapter VIII of the comprehensive plan.


CHAPTER IX               TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PLAN
Goals:
   1. Provide public street standards that recognize the multi-purpose nature of the street right-
       of-way (utilities, vehicles, pedestrians).

Finding:        The proposed amendments to the parks master plan to include the Council Creek
                Trail and the proposed amendments to the Transportation System Plan (TSP) both
                include roadway cross sections for the new UGB. These proposed cross section
                accommodate utilities, vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with Goal 1 of Chapter IX of the
                comprehensive plan.

    2. Provide transportation facilities that through design and location enhance the livability of
       Cornelius.

Finding:        The proposed amendments to the TSP include the location of new collector
                roadways as well as a recommendation to maintain livability within adjacent
                neighborhoods as the SE UGB builds out. The new collector roadway system when
                developed will not only provide new opportunities for ingress and egress to the SE
                UGB area for new residents, it will also provide an alternate route for existing
                residents to be able to access the Highway to travel eastbound and a route for
                residents traveling westbound on the Highway to access their homes. The new
                collector system will also include provisions for bicyclists and pedestrians,
                providing alternative options for existing and new residents. The proposed
                roadway cross sections intended to accommodate the north-south component of
                the Council Creek Trail through the SE UGB will also enhance the livability for
                existing and new residents by providing a safe and efficient connection to a
                planned east-west trail (Council Creek Regional Trail) which will provide
                opportunities for recreation and non-motorized commuting when completed. The
                recommended “trigger” for when the 29th Street corridor and intersection
                improvement need to be completed as part of the TSP amendments seeks to allow
                for the development of the SE UGB while also retaining current livability standards
                for those who live along the S 20th Avenue and S 26th Avenue corridors. The

                proposed comprehensive plan amendments area consistent with Goal 2 of
                Chapter IX of the comprehensive plan.

    3. Provide connectivity to each area of the City.

Finding:        The proposed amendments include new roads and trails designed to provide good
                connectivity to the 2014 UGB areas. The proposed amendments to the parks
                master plan to adopt the Council Creek Trail alignment will provide opportunities
                to increase pedestrian and bicycle connectivity throughout the community. As each
                individual property annexes and develops, City Staff will review the proposals and
                make sure that the connectivity standards articulated within the City’s TSP and
                subdivision ordinance (Title 17 of the Cornelius City Code) and Chapter 18.143 of
                the Cornelius City Code (Transportation Facilities) are adhered to. The proposed
                amendments will result in increased connectivity throughout the community and
                the existing development standards will ensure that appropriate connections are
                required as properties develop consistent with the intent of this goal of Chapter IX
                of the comprehensive plan.

    4. Develop a safe, complete and efficient transportation system that provides multi-modal
       access.

Finding:        The proposed amendments to the TSP and parks master plan include new trails
                and road cross sections that will provide for increased multi-modal access to and
                from the areas added to the UGB in 2014. The proposed collector roadway system
                in the SE UGB will provide for safe and efficient access for all modes of travel. The
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with goal 4 of Chapter
                IX of the comprehensive plan.

    5. Establish rights-of-way at the time of development and where appropriate officially secure
       them by dedication of the property.

Finding:        The proposed amendments to the TSP and parks master plan identify future right-
                of-ways (ROWs) that will need to be secured in the future. Identifying these ROWs
                now and including them within the comprehensive plan provides City Staff the
                opportunity to secure them at the time of development when appropriate. The
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with goal 5 of Chapter
                IX of the comprehensive plan.

    6. Continue to coordinate with ODOT, Washington County, and adjacent property owners
       towards the goal of funding all planned improvements along the highway. Such
       improvements will not only improve multi-modal circulation, but will also substantially
       enhance the visual quality of the most visible features in Cornelius. This in turn will improve
       the commercial market environment.

Finding:        The proposed amendments do not include any new planned improvements along
                the highway. This is in part because the existing TSP already includes the 29th
                Street Intersection and Corridor improvement. The proposed adoption of the

                                                                                          October 5, 2015
                Council Creek Trail will result in a new improvement that will cross the highway.
                Both ODOT and Washington County were engaged in the UGB planning process
                as well as the Council Creek Regional Trail process from the onset as members
                of the Technical Advisory Committee. The City closely coordinates with
                Washington County on an on-going basis regarding future transportation
                improvements and updates to the City and County’s TSP. Therefor the proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with goal 6 of Chapter IX of the
                comprehensive plan.

    7. Work for the development of a strong north-to-south transportation link to its primary trade
       area.

Finding:        This goal is not applicable to this review as there is not negative impact associated
                with the proposed comprehensive plan and map amendments that would inhibit
                the City from developing the transportation link provided above.

    8. Continue to explore mechanism to enhance the multi-modal access and circulation
       throughout the community.

Finding:        The proposed amendments include improvements/facilities that will improve the
                multi-modal access throughout the community. The new collector roadway system
                and Council Creek Trail will provide new bike and pedestrian improvements that
                will increase multi-modal circulation throughout the community when completed.
                The proposed comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with goal 8 of
                Chapter IX of the comprehensive plan.

    9. Coordinate with Tri-Met to continue enhancements at bus stops to provide a more
       attractive environment for transit users.

Date:       August 10, 2015
To:         Michael Cerbone, Community Development Director, City of Cornelius
            Terry Keyes, City Engineer, City of Cornelius
From:       Ken Condit, PE, through Keith Jones, AICP
Project: City of Cornelius Comprehensive Plan Amendment –
         Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Areas
Subject: Conceptual Analysis of Wastewater Facilities Extensions

A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – KEY FINDINGS

      1. Southeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
          a. The extension of sewer service to the Southeast Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) Expansion Area (South
             Area) will require a pump station and force main.
          b. A central location for the South-Area pump station appears feasible and offers the most flexibility in
             developing the layout of the future South-Area collector sewers.
          c. It is preferable to have the wastewater (WW) generated by the new school in the northeast portion of the
             South Area conveyed by gravity to the new pump station serving the South Area.
          d. Under this concept, only the northwest portion of the South Area will be served by direct, gravity flow to
             the City’s existing sewer system.
          e. The WW generated in the South Area will be conveyed to the City’s existing South Trunk Sewer under
             Ginger Street. The preferred point of connection to the South Trunk is at 20th Avenue and Ginger.

      2. South Trunk Sewer Upgrade
          a. Our analysis confirms that the upper reaches of the South Trunk must be increased in size to handle existing
             and projected peak flows. These sewer reaches extend from Heather Street, through Free Orchards Park
             to Emerald Loop, and east along Ginger to 23rd Avenue.
          b. Within the scope of this study, we have identified 3,005 linear feet of the South Trunk that needs to be
             increased in size. The scope of our analysis excluded the South Trunk reaches downstream of Heather.

      3. Northeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
          a. A conceptual sewer layout has been developed for the Northeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
             (North Area) to show the feasibility of extending gravity sewer service to the area.
          b. The conceptual layout divides the North Area into four sewer sub-basins that would convey WW to the
             existing North-South Trunk Sewer and/or the existing Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
B. INTRODUCTION

      This technical memorandum describes the results of the analysis we performed to address sanitary sewer service
      extensions into the areas covered by the recent UGB expansion. The analysis was performed as part of the
      Comprehensive Planning process that is required for lands within the UGB.

      Planning-level concepts have been developed to document the feasibility of providing WW facilities in the UGB
      expansion areas and connecting these facilities to the existing WW infrastructure. The projected impacts of
      connecting these service extensions to the City’s existing sewer system have also been identified.


Issued Final                                             Page 1                                              08/10/2015
Technical Memorandum                                      Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

    Clean Water Services (CWS) will need to conduct a separate facilities planning process to address the projected
    impacts on downstream WW components owned by that agency.

C. SOUTHEAST UGB EXPANSION AREA SERVICE CONCEPT

    1. General Concept
        a. The sewer service concept for the South Area assumes future developments will generally follow existing
           local topography.
        b. Due to the general topography (sloping down toward the river), most of the South Area cannot be served
           by gravity sewers that would be tributary to the City’s existing sewer system. Therefore, gravity sewers
           for the South Area will need to be tributary to a future South Cornelius Pump Station (SCPS).
        c. The force main for the SCPS will discharge WW into the City’s existing South Trunk sewer located under
           Ginger Street (see Item 5 below for discharge options).
        d. The alignments of future South-Area gravity sewers and the SCPS force main will be affected by
           development patterns. Alignments shown in our conceptual layout are provided for illustration purposes.

    2. Projected WW Production
        a. Projected Build-Out Development:
                  Projected Residential – 1,200 DU
                  Projected Institutional (High School) – 2,500 Students
                  Projected Commercial & Industrial – None
        b. CWS Flow Criteria from West Basin Facilities Plan (Carollo, 2012) and other CWS input:
                  Average Residential Occupancy – 2.6 People/Dwelling Unit (DU)
                  Average Per Capita WW Flow – 67 Gallons per Capita/Day
                  I/I contributions from future developments on currently undeveloped land:
                    Near-term I/I Contribution Factor (25 years for PS planning) – 1,650 gpd/acre (gpad)
                    Long-term I/I Contribution Factor (50 years for sewer planning) – 4,000 gpad
        c. Projected Average Dry-Weather WW Flows at Build-Out.
                  Projected Build-Out Population – 3,120 People
                  Projected Average WW Production – 209,000 Gallons per Day (gpd)
                  Projected Institutional (High School) – 30,000 gpd (12 gpd/student)
                  Projected Total Average WW Flow – 239,000 gpd
        d. Projected Peak Build-Out WW Flows.
                  Estimated Peaking Factor – 3.0 (Peak-to-Average Flow Ratio)
                  Projected Peak WW Contribution – 720,000 gpd
                  Peak Infiltration/Inflow Allowances
                    Near-term I/I Contribution – 297,000 gpd (1,650 gpad x 180 net acres)
                    Long-term I/I Contribution – 720,000 gpd (4,000 gpad x 180 net acres)
                    Net acreage excludes low-lying land along southerly boundary of South Area and half of school
                       site that is assumed to be playing fields.
                  Projected Peak Flow –
                    Near-term (25-year) Planning for PS Capacity – 1,020,0000 gpd ≈ 710 gallons per minute (gpm)
                    Long-term (50-year) Planning for Sewer Capacity – 1,440,0000 gpd ≈ 1,000 gpm
Issued Final                                             Page 2                                             08/10/2015
Technical Memorandum                                         Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

    3. South Cornelius Pump Station
        a. Concept-Level PS Capacity – 750 gpm (Preliminary Projection for Build-Out and Near-term I/I).
        b. Approximate Minimum Elevation for Development – 156-160 feet
        c. Approximate PS Floor Level (Top of Wetwell) – Elevation 154-158 feet
        d. Approximate Sewer Inverts at Wetwell – Elevation 140-142 feet
        e. Potential PS Sites Identified for Planning (see Exhibit 1)
                  Site 1 – Central Location near swale south of 26th Avenue
                  Site 2 – SE Location between 345th Avenue and Tualatin River
                  Site 3 – SW Location near swale outlet to river
        f.     Site 1 is identified as the preferred site for planning purposes.
                  The more centralized site offers more flexibility in developing the tributary gravity sewers.
                  The central site helps to limit the maximum depth of the tributary gravity sewers.
                  The other two sites would probably require a lower inlet invert at the PS wetwell.

    4. School Site Service Options
        a. Sewer service to the school can be extended from the new South-Area collection system or potentially
           from the existing City sewer system to the west (see Exhibit 1).
        b. Gravity Flow South: This option would have WW from the school conveyed by gravity into the sewer
           system for the South Area tributary to the future SCPS.
        c. Gravity Flow West:
                  This option would have WW from the school conveyed by gravity into the City’s sewer system at the
                   east end of existing Dogwood Street.
                  Flows through the Dogwood sewer eventually reach the South Trunk Sewer at 23rd Avenue.
                  The ability to serve the school site from Dogwood would depend on the actual location and elevation
                   of the school, as well as the elevation, capacity and accessibility of the existing sewer in Dogwood.
        d. For planning purposes we show the school being served by the future South-Area sewers and SCPS. The
           reasons for this assumption are described below.
                  This approach provides a more conservative projection for the PS capacity.
                  There are concerns about accessibility for maintenance if sewer service were extended from Dogwood.
                  Because the WW contribution from the school is a small portion of the overall South-Area WW flow,
                   future impacts on the existing South Trunk Sewer would likely be similar for either option.

    5. South-Area Connection to City’s Existing Sewer System
        a. South-Area WW can be discharged into the existing South Trunk Sewer at either 20th Avenue or
           Webb/26th Avenue (see Exhibit 1)
        b. It is preferable to connect to the South Trunk Sewer at 20th Avenue because that is further downstream
           and will not impact the existing pipe between 26th and 20th.
        c. The force main from the SCPS can discharge to a gravity sewer in the South Area that will extend west
           and then north to the intersection of Ginger and 20th as shown in Exhibit 1. Based on the preliminary
           projection for the SCPS capacity and minimum sewer slope, this South-Area outlet sewer will need to be
           12 inches in diameter.

    6. Assumptions for Conceptual Layout
        a. The layout assumes the gravity sewers tributary to the SCPS would be 8 inches in diameter with a minimum
           slope of 0.5%.
        b. The layout assumes a minimum depth to the sewer invert of about 6 feet.

D. IMPACT OF SOUTH AREA ON EXISTING SYSTEM

    1. Scope
        Our study of downstream impacts from the South Area was limited to an analysis of the effect the projected
        peak hourly flow from projected development will have on an upper reach of the existing South Trunk Sewer.
        This section of the existing sewer extends under Ginger Street, Emerald Loop and the Free Orchards City Park
        to Heather Street, near 15th Avenue (see Exhibit 1).

    2. Background
        The 2012 CWS West Basin Facilities Plan (WBFP) previously identified capacity deficiencies in most of the
        South Trunk Sewer and recommended replacement of about 3,800 feet of this upper reach with larger pipe
        sizes.

    3. Purpose
        The purpose of our impact analysis is to provide updated recommendations for pipe replacements. The update
        is based on the peak flow projections we generated from the current land-use plan for the South Area (see
        Section C above) and more-recent information on I/I contributions provided by CWS.

    4. South Trunk Field Survey
        A field survey was performed of the manholes along the upper reach of the South Trunk from Heather Street
        to 26th Avenue. This survey established current data for existing pipe sizes, invert elevations and manhole rim
        elevations that were used to generate an updated model of this upper reach. The data is shown in Appendix A.

    5. South Trunk Analysis
        a. We evaluated the upper reach of the South Trunk by applying estimates of peak WW and infiltration/inflow
           contributions from currently developed areas and applying the projected near-term and long-term SCPS
           flow capacities at the preferred discharge point.
        b. We generated flow estimates from existing, tributary developments using criteria for WW generation listed
           in the WBFP and updated I/I criteria supplied by CWS. These estimates assume no redevelopment will
           occur in the tributary areas to significantly increase WW flows.
        c. Breakdowns of the estimated flows into the South Trunk are listed in Table 1 (following page) and shown
           in Exhibit 2. The projected peak WW flows from developed areas are similar to the WBFP, but do not
           coincide exactly. The projected I/I contributions are lower than the WBFP because CWS identified a
           lower, per-acre I/I contribution based on more-recent flow data the agency obtained for the South Trunk
           sub-basin.

    6. Results of Analysis
        The pipe replacements identified in our planning-level analysis of the South Trunk are listed in Table 2
        (following page). The results of our analysis are further described in the following paragraphs.
        a. Our results generally coincide with the recommendations of the WBFP from Heather (MH #20045)
           upstream to 20th and Ginger (MH #20034). An 18-inch sewer pipe is needed to convey projected peak
           flows through these segments for both the near-term and long-term I/I contributions from the South Area.

Issued Final                                           Page 4                                              08/10/2015
Technical Memorandum                                        Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

               The 18-inch pipe size assumes the existing, inverted siphons in Free Orchards Park will be replaced with
               straight, gravity sewers that will be laid aboveground across the low-lying swales. These sewers will need
               to be supported from pedestrian boardwalks or similar structures through these locations.
               Pipe bursting could potentially be used to replace the existing buried 12-inch sewer with an 18-inch pipe.
               However, the existing South Trunk has a fairly shallow depth of burial under Emerald Loop and where
               Ginger transitions to 18th Avenue. Consequently, surface heaving could be a major concern with pipe
               bursting in this stretch. Installation methods will need to be further addressed at a later stage of project
               development.
         b. Our analysis indicates a 12-inch pipe is needed for the pipe reach in Ginger between 20th and 23rd Avenues
            based on the average slope. This conclusion contrasts with the WBFP recommendation for a 15-inch pipe
            along this reach. The difference may result from the lower I/I contribution provided by CWS and a shift
            of the South-Area sewer connection further downstream along the South Trunk.
               It should be noted our survey of the MHs along the South Trunk shows one sewer length in this reach,
               between MHs #20031 and #20032, has a very mild slope of 0.07%. If this pipe were replaced through pipe
               bursting, it would continue to have a mild slope, which would reduce the pipe capacity and could promote
               solids deposition. This issue will need to be considered when evaluating installation methods for this reach.

E. NORTH EXPANSION AREA SERVICE CONCEPT

    1. General Concept:
        a. The conceptual sewer layout would provide gravity service to the North Area. The layout is shown in
               Exhibit 3.
        b. The sewer layout is generally based on current development patterns (layout of lots, streets & railroad)
               with most sewers following an existing R-O-W.
        c. The gravity sewers would be divided into four separate sub-basins: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and
               Southeast.
        d. All four sub-basins would be tributary to the Clean Water Services’ Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
    2. Projected WW Production
        a. Projected Build-Out Development:
                  Projected Residential – 480 DU
                  Projected Commercial – 6 acres
                  Projected Industrial & Institutional – None
        b. CWS Flow Criteria from West Basin Facilities Plan (Carollo, 2012) and other CWS input:
                  Average Residential Occupancy – 2.6 People/Dwelling Unit (DU)
                  Average Per Capita WW Flow – 67 Gallons per Capita/Day
                  Average flow contribution from commercial land – 1,000 gpd/acre (gpad)
                  Long-term I/I contribution from currently undeveloped land – 4,000 gpd/acre (gpad)
        c. Projected Average Dry-Weather WW Flows at Build-Out.
                  Projected Build-Out Population – 1,250 People
                  Projected Residential –83,620 Gallons per Day (gpd)
                  Projected Commercial – 6,000 gpd
                  Projected Total Average WW Flow – 89,620 gpd
        d. Projected Peak Build-Out WW Flows.
                  Estimated Peaking Factor – 4.0 (Peak-to-Average Flow Ratio)
                  Projected Peak WW Contribution – 358,500 gpd
                  Peak Infiltration/Inflow Allowance – 300,000 gpd (4,000 gpad x 75 net acres)
                  Projected Peak Flow – 660,000 gpd ≈ 460 gallons per minute (gpm)

    3. Sewer Drainage Pattern
        a. NW Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would drain to the west along the existing ODOT railroad R-O-W.
                  WW flows would discharge into an existing sewer that extends down from the Trailer Park to the
                   existing North-South Trunk Sewer.
                  The east boundary of the NW sub-basin is limited by a highpoint in the RR line between 338th and
                   341st Avenues. East of this point the RR grade slopes down to Dairy Creek.

Technical Memorandum                                      Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

        b. NE Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would serve areas that generally slope to the north and east toward Council Creek or
                   Dairy Creek.
                  WW flows would discharge through a gravity sewer extending across the RR line and north along
                   334th Avenue to the existing Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
        c. SW Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would generally drain west to the existing sewer along East Lane just north of Baseline
                   Street. The service concept is laid out to minimize the amount of area served by the SW Sub-basin
                   due to constraints posed by existing utilities in the Baseline R-O-W.
                  The existing sewer extending along Baseline is on the south side of the R-O-W. Gravity sewer service
                   from the area north of Baseline is prevented from discharging into this existing sewer by the 72-inch
                   water transmission main under the north side of Baseline.
                  Existing utilities along the north side of the Baseline R-O-W limit the space that would be available
                   for a new parallel sewer on the north side of Baseline.
                  The mobile home park on East and West Lanes is currently served by existing gravity sewers.
        d. SE Sub-basin
                  This Sub-basin would serve a small area on the south side of Baseline, east of the current City limit.
                  The area would be served by an extension of the existing 8-inch sewer that extends along the south
                   side of Baseline. The Baseline sewer discharges into the north-south trunk sewer.

    4. Approximate Peak WW Flow Distribution to Existing Trunk Sewers
        a. Approximate flow to N-S Trunk (NW, SW & SE Sub-basins) – 290,000 gpd (60%)
        b. Approximate flow directly to Council Creek Trunk (NE Sub-basin) – 195,000 gpd (40%)

    5. Assumptions for Conceptual Layout
        a. The layout assumes gravity sewers would be 8 inches in diameter with a minimum slope of 0.5%.
        b. The layout assumes a minimum depth to the sewer invert of 6 feet and a maximum depth of about 15 feet.

F. IMPACT OF NORTH AREA ON EXISTING SYSTEM

    1. City’s Baseline Street Sewer
        A small amount of additional WW from projected commercial development in the SE Sub-basin will discharge
        into the City’s existing sewer along the south side of Baseline. This projected WW contribution will be too
        minor to impact the existing sewer system.

    2. North-South Trunk Sewer
        The conceptual layout for the North Area would convey projected flows from the NW and SW Sub-basins into
        the existing CWS North-South Trunk Sewer. CWS records show this line extending from East Lane, just north
        of Baseline, up to the Council Creek Trunk Sewer. These records also show the line as an 8-inch pipe with
        most sections between manholes laid at a slope of 0.4%. The North-South Trunk sewer currently receives
        flows from collector sewers in Baseline and two other City collector sewers north of Baseline.
        If future development is evenly distributed throughout the North Area, the NW and SW Sub-basins could carry
        more than half the projected flows. Since an 8-inch pipe with a 0.4% slope has a capacity of about 0.5 MGD
        before surcharging, future flows from the NW and SW Sub-basins could surcharge the line. Future CWS
        facilities planning efforts will need to model the line to verify whether the North-South Trunk will be adequate.

Technical Memorandum                                     Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

    3. Council Creek Trunk Sewer
        The sewer service concept for the North Area results in all future WW flows generated in the area being
        conveyed to the Council Creek Trunk Sewer. The NE Sub-basin will drain directly to this line and the other
        sub-basins will be conveyed to this line through the North-South Trunk Sewer.
        CWS records show the Council Creek line as a 42-inch pipe between the North-South Trunk and 334th Avenue.
        This existing 42-inch pipe line would need to be at or very near capacity to be impacted at all by the projected
        WW flows from the North Area. Future CWS modeling of this line will need to address the potential for any
        impacts from the North Area.

G. ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE COST
    As part of the comprehensive planning process, we developed estimates of the probable project costs for the SCPS,
    the associated PS force main and downstream South-Area gravity sewer, and the South Trunk Sewer replacements.
    We used cost information presented in the WBFP as the basis for the estimates and then applied an inflation factor
    based on the 20-City Average Construction Cost Index (CCI) published by Engineering News Record (ENR).
    The probable project costs include a 30% allowance for construction contingencies and a 35% allowance for non-
    construction costs (engineering, environmental and legal services and project administration).

    The level of detail of these cost estimates is consistent with Estimate Class 4 described by the Association for the
    Advancement of Cost Engineering International (Recommended Practice #18R-97, Rev. November 2011).
    Accordingly, the accuracy is anticipated to be within –25% to +35% of the actual cost.
    The actual cost of the improvements will depend on project scope, design development, and actual market
    conditions at bid time. Costs will also depend on specific site conditions and other variable factors. More detailed
    estimates of the probable costs will need to be prepared as part of further project planning and design efforts.

                Exhibit D


Amendments to the City of Cornelius Water
      Master Plan (Appendix I)
Study Area
       The Urban Growth Expansion (UGB) area consists of two parts. The Northeast UGB area
       is primarily north of Baseline and south of the Council Creek flood plain, just east of the
       current City limits. The Southeast UGB area is north of the Tualatin River flood plain and
       west of 345th Avenue. These areas are shown in the map below.




Water Infrastructure – Northeast UGB Area
       The City of Hillsboro currently provides water service to the Northeast UGB.
       Attachment 1 shows the current system. While Hillsboro and Cornelius have had very
       preliminary talks regarding Cornelius taking over the water system in this area, the City
       of Cornelius has been cool to the idea because much of the system in the area is
       undersized and does not meet current standards.

       Attachment 2 shows the improvements that are likely needed to bring the water system
       in this area up to City of Cornelius standards. Most of the improvements involve
       upgrading the existing lines to 8” and adding fire hydrants. The line on 341st is shown as
       a 12” line based on the assumption that without a looped system, any significant
       development north of the railroad will need a 12” line to achieve adequate flow.




                                                                                                   1
       The cost of bringing the water infrastructure in this area up to current standards is
       approximately:

                                      4,000 LF @ $130/LF = $520,000

       This cost cannot be justified based on the limited amount of water user fee revenue the
       area would produce. Therefore, if the Northeast UGB area is annexed to the City of
       Cornelius, the annexation will likely occur in small chunks as development occurs. With
       each annexation, Cornelius will take over the portion of the water system needed to
       serve that area. The development necessitating the annexation will be primarily
       responsible for improving the annexed part of the Hillsboro water system to Cornelius
       standards.

       Storage needs for the Northeast UGB area can be easily handled by the City’s current
       1.5 MG (million-gallons) above ground reservoir and its 50+MG Aquifer Storage and
       Recovery (ASR) System scheduled to come on line in 2017.

       Flow needs for this area can be handled from three sources.

           1. 12” Cornelius main line on the north side of Baseline that currently ends at East
              Lane
           2. 12” Cornelius main line on the south side of Baseline that currently ends at the
              Coastal Farm Store at about 336th Avenue
           3. Existing but unused transfer station from the Hillsboro 72” transmission line in
              Baseline to the Cornelius system at East Lane


       In summary, the City of Cornelius can easily serve the Northeast UGB area. The primary
       concern is the fact that most pipes in this area are substandard. Bringing this area up to
       current standards is an expensive proposition that is not currently programed into the
       Cornelius water rate structure. Therefore, improvements to the water infrastructure in
       this area will be required at the time of development. Until areas are annexed into the
       City the system within this area will remain within Hillsboro’s service district and will be
       maintained and operated by Hillsboro.


Water Infrastructure Needs – Southeast UGB Area
       The Southeast UGB area represents a clean slate in that the area contains almost no
       existing water infrastructure. The only public water facility in the area is a 2” plastic line
       from Baseline south along 345th to serve approximately 8 residents within ¼ mile of
       Baseline. Since most of these residents are outside the UGB expansion area, the City
       does not intend to upgrade this 2” plastic line in the foreseeable future. However, the
       south end of this line may be looped into the new water infrastructure in the UGB area
       to protect against an emergency such as a line break.


                                                                                                    2
       When developed, the Southeast UGB area will be served by 12” mains under the
       planned collector streets. The collector streets are expected to include: 29th south of
       Baseline, 26th and 20th south of Ginger, Dogwood east of 28th, and a new east-west
       collector south of the current city limits that connects 20th, 26thand 29th. All local streets
       will be underlain with 8” water mains, the minimum standard required by Cornelius.

       In addition, to provide adequate flow and pressure to this area at build-out, some
       improvements in the City’s existing water system may be required. The needed
       improvements will be determined when the City completes its water master plan
       update later this year. However, the improvements to the existing system that are likely
       to be needed at full development of the UGB area include:

           •   12” line to replace existing 8” line in Dogwood from 18th to 20th
           •   12” line to replace 8” line in 20th from Dogwood to Southeast UGB area
           •   12” line to replace 8” line in 26th from Dogwood to Southeast UGB area

       These improvements are not needed initially, but will be required as the area nears
       build-out. When the City’s water master plan update is completed in late 2015, the
       amount of development the existing system can support will be determined. For
       development that occurs before the master plan update is complete, the developer will
       be responsible for proving that the existing system can provide adequate flow and
       pressure to the UGB area. If adequate flow and pressure cannot be attained, the
       developer will need to make the improvements noted above.

       Storage needs for the Southeast UGB area can be handled by the City’s current 1.5 MG
       above ground reservoir and its 50+MG Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) System
       scheduled to come on line in 2017.


Water Infrastructure Costs – Southeast UGB Area
       All the new water mains in the Southeast UGB area will be installed and funded by
       developers. However, the City must pay for oversizing of lines greater than 8” size. In
       other words, while the developers are responsible for funding the installation of 8” lines
       under all the streets in this area, the City must fund the additional cost of 12” lines
       where they are needed. The cost of this upsizing of lines to 12” is estimated to be:

               12” oversize cost in UGB area = ~10,000 LF @ $20/LF = $200,000

       Furthermore, the City must fund improvements to piping outside the UGB area. These
       improvements are listed above and will cost approximately:

               12” replacement lines inside UGB area = ~2,200 LF @ $140/LF = $300,000



                                                                                                   3
       Water SDCs from the southeast UGB area are expected to be:

              1,100 single family residences @ $3,884 SDC per residence = ~$4M

       Therefore, the water SDCs captured from the new development in the southeast UGB
       area are more than adequate to fund the improvements to pipes needed to serve this
       area.


Recommendations
     In the Northeast UGB area, staff recommends the area continue to be served by the City
     of Hillsboro until parcels are annexed. At the time parcels are annexed into the City of
     Cornelius, Cornelius should take over the portion of Hillsboro’s system needed to serve
     the annexed parcel. Developers should pay for all improvements needed to bring lines
     up to City of Cornelius standards.

       In the Southeast UGB area, developers should design and install all water mains. The
       City shall pay for oversizing mains under collectors to 12” from the 8” standard size. The
       City shall also design, build, and fund improvements necessary to the water mains
       within the current City boundaries.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Transportation Planning Rule Findings 
The traffic analysis completed for the proposed Cornelius UGB expansion areas found the potential 
vehicle trip increase would not significantly impact the surrounding transportation system and would 
satisfy the requirements of OAR 660‐012‐0060. No capacity improvements to existing facilities beyond 
those identified in the RTP and Cornelius TSP are required to support the UGB expansion areas. Further 
analysis of Tualatin Valley Highway west of 345th Avenue should be included in the upcoming Cornelius 
TSP update to identify specific projects to serve fronting property needs for access, capacity and safety. 

Local Improvements 
Local roadway projects would be required to support the UGB expansion areas and provide adequate 
access and internal circulation. Based on the City’s functional classification designations13 and the future 
2040 PM peak hour volume forecasts, recommended local improvements were identified as shown in 
Table 11. Planning level cost estimates were developed for each roadway project based on the collector 
cross‐section with parking on both sides of the street (shown in Figure 9). If the collector facilities were 
constructed with a narrower cross‐section (shown in Figures 10 and 11) the costs would be lower.

Amendments to the City of Cornelius Storm
  Drainage/Surface Water Master Plan
             (Appendix H)
Study Area
       The Urban Growth Expansion (UGB) area consists of two parts. The Northeast UGB area
       is primarily north of Baseline and south of the Council Creek flood plain, just east of the
       current City limits. The Southeast UGB area is north of the Tualatin River flood plain and
       west of 345th Avenue. These areas are shown in the map below.




       The terrain in these two areas is generally flat. The Northeast area largely slopes to the
       north toward Council Creek. The only waterway in this area is a large wetland area that
       separates the UGB expansion area from the current City boundary. This wetland area
       drains north toward Council Creek.

       The Southeast area primarily slopes to the south toward the Tualatin River. The only
       waterway in this area is an agricultural ditch that starts where 26th Avenue turns into
       Webb Road and then traverses in a south-southwest direction toward the Tualatin
       River.




                                                                                                 1
Existing Stormwater Facilities
        The only existing stormwater facilities in the Northeast UGB area are roadside and
        trackside ditches along Baseline, the north-south streets traversing the area, and the
        railroad north of Baseline.

       The stormwater facilities in the Southeast UGB area are limited to the roadside ditches
       on 345th Avenue and railroad ditches along the railroad south of Baseline.

       As development occurs, these facilities are expected to be replaced with facilities
       meeting current Clean Water Service (CWS) standards.


Stormwater Standards Overview
      Any new development in the UGB expansion areas must at a minimum meet the current
      Design and Construction (D&C) Standards for Sanitary Sewer and Surface Water
      Management issued by CWS.

       Some UGB expansion areas in Washington County, notably Tigard’s River Terrace and
       the unincorporated North Bethany, created additional stormwater standards that go
       beyond the D&C Standards. In the case of River Terrace, severe erosion in the stream
       corridors coming off the south side of Bull Mountain necessitated a more stringent
       approach to stormwater control in the area.

       In North Bethany’s case, CWS desired to incorporate extensive LIDA (low-impact
       development practices) into the area and pre-built a number of large regional facilities.
       This was deemed more desirable to the creation of individual stormwater facilities in
       each development phase.

       One downside of the North Bethany approach is that CWS has had difficulty keeping
       ahead of development with new facilities. Also, by CWS constructing regional facilities
       rather than each developer constructing their own facilities, North Bethany has a large
       stormwater fee or system development charge that is unique in Washington County.

       Finally, the D&C Standards issued by CWS are expected to change significantly as a
       result of a new MS4 permit from the State of Oregon, Department of Environmental
       Quality (DEQ) to CWS. One change in the new MS4 permit will be an increased level of
       treatment for stormwater. However, the most significant change in the standards is
       expected to be a requirement to deal with hydro-modification. Instituting this type of
       requirement is expected to create the need for very large detention and retention
       facilities on new development sites.




                                                                                                   2
Cornelius Plan
       Because Cornelius does not face the problems Tigard does on Bull Mountain and
       because the City does not have the staff to plan, design, and build regional facilities, as
       CWS is doing in North Bethany, Cornelius will require developers to meet the current
       stormwater standards issued by CWS. While this approach is not innovative, it has been
       used successfully for decades in urban Washington County to manage stormwater
       runoff.

        The only variations from the CWS standards are:

           1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems, e.g., Stormfilters, for
              treatment on parts of the system that the City must maintain in the future, i.e.,
              facilities to be dedicated to the City.
           2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
              facilities.

        The reason for the prohibition on proprietary systems is the additional maintenance
        burden these pose for the City at a time when stormwater maintenance funding is
        extremely limited. Likewise, the single-family lot LIDA facilities require on-going City
        inspection and oversight that the City does not have funding to undertake.


Costs
        Since developers will be responsible for designing and constructing stormwater facilities
        in the new UGB areas, the City will incur zero capital costs for these systems. The City
        will, however, incur, increased maintenance costs long-term, but these costs are funded
        by monthly stormwater fees payable by the new residents and businesses in the area.


Recommendations
     Staff recommends the City use the CWS D&C Standards that are applicable at the time
     of development to address stormwater issues in the UGB areas. Staff further
     recommends, the following two conditions be placed on all new development in these
     areas:

           1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems for treatment on parts
              of the system that the City must maintain in the future.
           2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
              facilities being used to meet subdivision stormwater quality or quantity
              requirements.

       identified public improvements necessary to support urbanization and is amending the
       Comprehensive Plan to include those improvements.
   11. The City has analyzed the Transportation System within the community consistent with
       The Oregon Transportation Planning Rule and concluded that additional improvements
       are necessary beyond those currently planned for the future and identified within the
       Comprehensive Plan.
   12. The City has examined the Parks and Open Space needs of the community relative to
       the Urban Growth Boundary expansion and has proposed specific amendments to the
       Parks Master Plan to reflect the need for additional parks facilities.
   13. The 2014 Urban Growth Boundary Findings and Summary dated October 5, 2015 is
       incorporated via reference as findings in support of this ordinance.

         Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Areas
Subject: Conceptual Analysis of Wastewater Facilities Extensions

A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – KEY FINDINGS

      1. Southeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
          a. The extension of sewer service to the Southeast Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) Expansion Area (South
             Area) will require a pump station and force main.
          b. A central location for the South-Area pump station appears feasible and offers the most flexibility in
             developing the layout of the future South-Area collector sewers.
          c. It is preferable to have the wastewater (WW) generated by the new school in the northeast portion of the
             South Area conveyed by gravity to the new pump station serving the South Area.
          d. Under this concept, only the northwest portion of the South Area will be served by direct, gravity flow to
             the City’s existing sewer system.
          e. The WW generated in the South Area will be conveyed to the City’s existing South Trunk Sewer under
             Ginger Street. The preferred point of connection to the South Trunk is at 20th Avenue and Ginger.

      2. South Trunk Sewer Upgrade
          a. Our analysis confirms that the upper reaches of the South Trunk must be increased in size to handle existing
             and projected peak flows. These sewer reaches extend from Heather Street, through Free Orchards Park
             to Emerald Loop, and east along Ginger to 23rd Avenue.
          b. Within the scope of this study, we have identified 3,005 linear feet of the South Trunk that needs to be
             increased in size. The scope of our analysis excluded the South Trunk reaches downstream of Heather.

      3. Northeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
          a. A conceptual sewer layout has been developed for the Northeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
             (North Area) to show the feasibility of extending gravity sewer service to the area.
          b. The conceptual layout divides the North Area into four sewer sub-basins that would convey WW to the
             existing North-South Trunk Sewer and/or the existing Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
B. INTRODUCTION

      This technical memorandum describes the results of the analysis we performed to address sanitary sewer service
      extensions into the areas covered by the recent UGB expansion. The analysis was performed as part of the
      Comprehensive Planning process that is required for lands within the UGB.

      Planning-level concepts have been developed to document the feasibility of providing WW facilities in the UGB
      expansion areas and connecting these facilities to the existing WW infrastructure. The projected impacts of
      connecting these service extensions to the City’s existing sewer system have also been identified.

    Clean Water Services (CWS) will need to conduct a separate facilities planning process to address the projected
    impacts on downstream WW components owned by that agency.

C. SOUTHEAST UGB EXPANSION AREA SERVICE CONCEPT

    1. General Concept
        a. The sewer service concept for the South Area assumes future developments will generally follow existing
           local topography.
        b. Due to the general topography (sloping down toward the river), most of the South Area cannot be served
           by gravity sewers that would be tributary to the City’s existing sewer system. Therefore, gravity sewers
           for the South Area will need to be tributary to a future South Cornelius Pump Station (SCPS).
        c. The force main for the SCPS will discharge WW into the City’s existing South Trunk sewer located under
           Ginger Street (see Item 5 below for discharge options).
        d. The alignments of future South-Area gravity sewers and the SCPS force main will be affected by
           development patterns. Alignments shown in our conceptual layout are provided for illustration purposes.

    2. Projected WW Production
        a. Projected Build-Out Development:
                  Projected Residential – 1,200 DU
                  Projected Institutional (High School) – 2,500 Students
                  Projected Commercial & Industrial – None
        b. CWS Flow Criteria from West Basin Facilities Plan (Carollo, 2012) and other CWS input:
                  Average Residential Occupancy – 2.6 People/Dwelling Unit (DU)
                  Average Per Capita WW Flow – 67 Gallons per Capita/Day
                  I/I contributions from future developments on currently undeveloped land:
                    Near-term I/I Contribution Factor (25 years for PS planning) – 1,650 gpd/acre (gpad)
                    Long-term I/I Contribution Factor (50 years for sewer planning) – 4,000 gpad
        c. Projected Average Dry-Weather WW Flows at Build-Out.
                  Projected Build-Out Population – 3,120 People

                  Projected Total Average WW Flow – 239,000 gpd
        d. Projected Peak Build-Out WW Flows.
                  Estimated Peaking Factor – 3.0 (Peak-to-Average Flow Ratio)
                  Projected Peak WW Contribution – 720,000 gpd
                  Peak Infiltration/Inflow Allowances
                    Near-term I/I Contribution – 297,000 gpd (1,650 gpad x 180 net acres)
                    Long-term I/I Contribution – 720,000 gpd (4,000 gpad x 180 net acres)
                    Net acreage excludes low-lying land along southerly boundary of South Area and half of school
                       site that is assumed to be playing fields.

    3. South Cornelius Pump Station
        a. Concept-Level PS Capacity – 750 gpm (Preliminary Projection for Build-Out and Near-term I/I).
        b. Approximate Minimum Elevation for Development – 156-160 feet
        c. Approximate PS Floor Level (Top of Wetwell) – Elevation 154-158 feet
        d. Approximate Sewer Inverts at Wetwell – Elevation 140-142 feet
        e. Potential PS Sites Identified for Planning (see Exhibit 1)
                  Site 1 – Central Location near swale south of 26th Avenue
                  Site 2 – SE Location between 345th Avenue and Tualatin River
                  Site 3 – SW Location near swale outlet to river
        f.     Site 1 is identified as the preferred site for planning purposes.
                  The more centralized site offers more flexibility in developing the tributary gravity sewers.
                  The central site helps to limit the maximum depth of the tributary gravity sewers.
                  The other two sites would probably require a lower inlet invert at the PS wetwell.

    4. School Site Service Options
        a. Sewer service to the school can be extended from the new South-Area collection system or potentially
           from the existing City sewer system to the west (see Exhibit 1).
        b. Gravity Flow South: This option would have WW from the school conveyed by gravity into the sewer
           system for the South Area tributary to the future SCPS.
        c. Gravity Flow West:
                  This option would have WW from the school conveyed by gravity into the City’s sewer system at the
                   east end of existing Dogwood Street.
                  Flows through the Dogwood sewer eventually reach the South Trunk Sewer at 23rd Avenue.
                  The ability to serve the school site from Dogwood would depend on the actual location and elevation
                   of the school, as well as the elevation, capacity and accessibility of the existing sewer in Dogwood.
        d. For planning purposes we show the school being served by the future South-Area sewers and SCPS. The
           reasons for this assumption are described below.
                  This approach provides a more conservative projection for the PS capacity.
                  There are concerns about accessibility for maintenance if sewer service were extended from Dogwood.
                  Because the WW contribution from the school is a small portion of the overall South-Area WW flow,
                   future impacts on the existing South Trunk Sewer would likely be similar for either option.

    5. South-Area Connection to City’s Existing Sewer System
        a. South-Area WW can be discharged into the existing South Trunk Sewer at either 20th Avenue or
           Webb/26th Avenue (see Exhibit 1)
        b. It is preferable to connect to the South Trunk Sewer at 20th Avenue because that is further downstream
           and will not impact the existing pipe between 26th and 20th.
        c. The force main from the SCPS can discharge to a gravity sewer in the South Area that will extend west
           and then north to the intersection of Ginger and 20th as shown in Exhibit 1. Based on the preliminary
           projection for the SCPS capacity and minimum sewer slope, this South-Area outlet sewer will need to be
           12 inches in diameter.

Technical Memorandum                                    Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

    6. Assumptions for Conceptual Layout
        a. The layout assumes the gravity sewers tributary to the SCPS would be 8 inches in diameter with a minimum
           slope of 0.5%.
        b. The layout assumes a minimum depth to the sewer invert of about 6 feet.

D. IMPACT OF SOUTH AREA ON EXISTING SYSTEM

    1. Scope
        Our study of downstream impacts from the South Area was limited to an analysis of the effect the projected
        peak hourly flow from projected development will have on an upper reach of the existing South Trunk Sewer.
        This section of the existing sewer extends under Ginger Street, Emerald Loop and the Free Orchards City Park
        to Heather Street, near 15th Avenue (see Exhibit 1).

    2. Background
        The 2012 CWS West Basin Facilities Plan (WBFP) previously identified capacity deficiencies in most of the
        South Trunk Sewer and recommended replacement of about 3,800 feet of this upper reach with larger pipe
        sizes.

    3. Purpose
        The purpose of our impact analysis is to provide updated recommendations for pipe replacements. The update
        is based on the peak flow projections we generated from the current land-use plan for the South Area (see
        Section C above) and more-recent information on I/I contributions provided by CWS.

    4. South Trunk Field Survey
        A field survey was performed of the manholes along the upper reach of the South Trunk from Heather Street
        to 26th Avenue. This survey established current data for existing pipe sizes, invert elevations and manhole rim
        elevations that were used to generate an updated model of this upper reach. The data is shown in Appendix A.

    5. South Trunk Analysis
        a. We evaluated the upper reach of the South Trunk by applying estimates of peak WW and infiltration/inflow
           contributions from currently developed areas and applying the projected near-term and long-term SCPS
           flow capacities at the preferred discharge point.
        b. We generated flow estimates from existing, tributary developments using criteria for WW generation listed
           in the WBFP and updated I/I criteria supplied by CWS. These estimates assume no redevelopment will
           occur in the tributary areas to significantly increase WW flows.
        c. Breakdowns of the estimated flows into the South Trunk are listed in Table 1 (following page) and shown
           in Exhibit 2. The projected peak WW flows from developed areas are similar to the WBFP, but do not
           coincide exactly. The projected I/I contributions are lower than the WBFP because CWS identified a
           lower, per-acre I/I contribution based on more-recent flow data the agency obtained for the South Trunk
           sub-basin.

    6. Results of Analysis
        The pipe replacements identified in our planning-level analysis of the South Trunk are listed in Table 2
        (following page). The results of our analysis are further described in the following paragraphs.
        a. Our results generally coincide with the recommendations of the WBFP from Heather (MH #20045)
           upstream to 20th and Ginger (MH #20034). An 18-inch sewer pipe is needed to convey projected peak
           flows through these segments for both the near-term and long-term I/I contributions from the South Area.

Issued Final                                           Page 4                                              08/10/2015
Technical Memorandum                                        Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

               The 18-inch pipe size assumes the existing, inverted siphons in Free Orchards Park will be replaced with
               straight, gravity sewers that will be laid aboveground across the low-lying swales. These sewers will need
               to be supported from pedestrian boardwalks or similar structures through these locations.
               Pipe bursting could potentially be used to replace the existing buried 12-inch sewer with an 18-inch pipe.
               However, the existing South Trunk has a fairly shallow depth of burial under Emerald Loop and where
               Ginger transitions to 18th Avenue. Consequently, surface heaving could be a major concern with pipe
               bursting in this stretch. Installation methods will need to be further addressed at a later stage of project
               development.
         b. Our analysis indicates a 12-inch pipe is needed for the pipe reach in Ginger between 20th and 23rd Avenues
            based on the average slope. This conclusion contrasts with the WBFP recommendation for a 15-inch pipe
            along this reach. The difference may result from the lower I/I contribution provided by CWS and a shift
            of the South-Area sewer connection further downstream along the South Trunk.
               It should be noted our survey of the MHs along the South Trunk shows one sewer length in this reach,
               between MHs #20031 and #20032, has a very mild slope of 0.07%. If this pipe were replaced through pipe
               bursting, it would continue to have a mild slope, which would reduce the pipe capacity and could promote
               solids deposition. This issue will need to be considered when evaluating installation methods for this reach.

E. NORTH EXPANSION AREA SERVICE CONCEPT

    1. General Concept:
        a. The conceptual sewer layout would provide gravity service to the North Area. The layout is shown in
               Exhibit 3.
        b. The sewer layout is generally based on current development patterns (layout of lots, streets & railroad)
               with most sewers following an existing R-O-W.
        c. The gravity sewers would be divided into four separate sub-basins: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and
               Southeast.
        d. All four sub-basins would be tributary to the Clean Water Services’ Council Creek Trunk Sewer.

    3. Sewer Drainage Pattern
        a. NW Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would drain to the west along the existing ODOT railroad R-O-W.
                  WW flows would discharge into an existing sewer that extends down from the Trailer Park to the
                   existing North-South Trunk Sewer.
                  The east boundary of the NW sub-basin is limited by a highpoint in the RR line between 338th and
                   341st Avenues. East of this point the RR grade slopes down to Dairy Creek.

Technical Memorandum                                      Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

        b. NE Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would serve areas that generally slope to the north and east toward Council Creek or
                   Dairy Creek.
                  WW flows would discharge through a gravity sewer extending across the RR line and north along
                   334th Avenue to the existing Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
        c. SW Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would generally drain west to the existing sewer along East Lane just north of Baseline
                   Street. The service concept is laid out to minimize the amount of area served by the SW Sub-basin
                   due to constraints posed by existing utilities in the Baseline R-O-W.
                  The existing sewer extending along Baseline is on the south side of the R-O-W. Gravity sewer service
                   from the area north of Baseline is prevented from discharging into this existing sewer by the 72-inch
                   water transmission main under the north side of Baseline.
                  Existing utilities along the north side of the Baseline R-O-W limit the space that would be available
                   for a new parallel sewer on the north side of Baseline.
                  The mobile home park on East and West Lanes is currently served by existing gravity sewers.
        d. SE Sub-basin
                  This Sub-basin would serve a small area on the south side of Baseline, east of the current City limit.
                  The area would be served by an extension of the existing 8-inch sewer that extends along the south
                   side of Baseline. The Baseline sewer discharges into the north-south trunk sewer.

    4. Approximate Peak WW Flow Distribution to Existing Trunk Sewers
        a. Approximate flow to N-S Trunk (NW, SW & SE Sub-basins) – 290,000 gpd (60%)
        b. Approximate flow directly to Council Creek Trunk (NE Sub-basin) – 195,000 gpd (40%)

    5. Assumptions for Conceptual Layout
        a. The layout assumes gravity sewers would be 8 inches in diameter with a minimum slope of 0.5%.
        b. The layout assumes a minimum depth to the sewer invert of 6 feet and a maximum depth of about 15 feet.

F. IMPACT OF NORTH AREA ON EXISTING SYSTEM

    1. City’s Baseline Street Sewer
        A small amount of additional WW from projected commercial development in the SE Sub-basin will discharge
        into the City’s existing sewer along the south side of Baseline. This projected WW contribution will be too
        minor to impact the existing sewer system.

    2. North-South Trunk Sewer
        The conceptual layout for the North Area would convey projected flows from the NW and SW Sub-basins into
        the existing CWS North-South Trunk Sewer. CWS records show this line extending from East Lane, just north
        of Baseline, up to the Council Creek Trunk Sewer. These records also show the line as an 8-inch pipe with
        most sections between manholes laid at a slope of 0.4%. The North-South Trunk sewer currently receives
        flows from collector sewers in Baseline and two other City collector sewers north of Baseline.
        If future development is evenly distributed throughout the North Area, the NW and SW Sub-basins could carry
        more than half the projected flows. Since an 8-inch pipe with a 0.4% slope has a capacity of about 0.5 MGD
        before surcharging, future flows from the NW and SW Sub-basins could surcharge the line. Future CWS
        facilities planning efforts will need to model the line to verify whether the North-South Trunk will be adequate.

    3. Council Creek Trunk Sewer
        The sewer service concept for the North Area results in all future WW flows generated in the area being
        conveyed to the Council Creek Trunk Sewer. The NE Sub-basin will drain directly to this line and the other
        sub-basins will be conveyed to this line through the North-South Trunk Sewer.
        CWS records show the Council Creek line as a 42-inch pipe between the North-South Trunk and 334th Avenue.
        This existing 42-inch pipe line would need to be at or very near capacity to be impacted at all by the projected
        WW flows from the North Area. Future CWS modeling of this line will need to address the potential for any
        impacts from the North Area.

G. ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE COST
    As part of the comprehensive planning process, we developed estimates of the probable project costs for the SCPS,
    the associated PS force main and downstream South-Area gravity sewer, and the South Trunk Sewer replacements.
    We used cost information presented in the WBFP as the basis for the estimates and then applied an inflation factor
    based on the 20-City Average Construction Cost Index (CCI) published by Engineering News Record (ENR).
    The probable project costs include a 30% allowance for construction contingencies and a 35% allowance for non-
    construction costs (engineering, environmental and legal services and project administration).

                               Estimates of Probable Project Costs (July 2015 **)

                 750-gpm South Cornelius Pump Station                             $     880,000
                 8-inch Force Main & 12-inch Downstream Gravity Sewer             $     650,000
                 South Trunk – Reach 1 Replacement (12-inch Sewer)                $     280,000
                 South Trunk – Reach 2-5 Replacement (18-inch Sewer)              $   1,450,000
                 Total Estimated Probable Project Costs                           $   3,260,000

               ** July 2015 ENR CCI = 10,037

    The level of detail of these cost estimates is consistent with Estimate Class 4 described by the Association for the
    Advancement of Cost Engineering International (Recommended Practice #18R-97, Rev. November 2011).
    Accordingly, the accuracy is anticipated to be within –25% to +35% of the actual cost.
    The actual cost of the improvements will depend on project scope, design development, and actual market
    conditions at bid time. Costs will also depend on specific site conditions and other variable factors. More detailed
    estimates of the probable costs will need to be prepared as part of further project planning and design efforts.

Amendments to the City of Cornelius Water
      Master Plan (Appendix I)
Study Area
       The Urban Growth Expansion (UGB) area consists of two parts. The Northeast UGB area
       is primarily north of Baseline and south of the Council Creek flood plain, just east of the
       current City limits. The Southeast UGB area is north of the Tualatin River flood plain and
       west of 345th Avenue. These areas are shown in the map below.




Water Infrastructure – Northeast UGB Area
       The City of Hillsboro currently provides water service to the Northeast UGB.
       Attachment 1 shows the current system. While Hillsboro and Cornelius have had very
       preliminary talks regarding Cornelius taking over the water system in this area, the City
       of Cornelius has been cool to the idea because much of the system in the area is
       undersized and does not meet current standards.

       Attachment 2 shows the improvements that are likely needed to bring the water system
       in this area up to City of Cornelius standards. Most of the improvements involve
       upgrading the existing lines to 8” and adding fire hydrants. The line on 341st is shown as
       a 12” line based on the assumption that without a looped system, any significant
       development north of the railroad will need a 12” line to achieve adequate flow.




                                                                                                   1
       The cost of bringing the water infrastructure in this area up to current standards is
       approximately:

                                      4,000 LF @ $130/LF = $520,000

       This cost cannot be justified based on the limited amount of water user fee revenue the
       area would produce. Therefore, if the Northeast UGB area is annexed to the City of
       Cornelius, the annexation will likely occur in small chunks as development occurs. With
       each annexation, Cornelius will take over the portion of the water system needed to
       serve that area. The development necessitating the annexation will be primarily
       responsible for improving the annexed part of the Hillsboro water system to Cornelius
       standards.

       Storage needs for the Northeast UGB area can be easily handled by the City’s current
       1.5 MG (million-gallons) above ground reservoir and its 50+MG Aquifer Storage and
       Recovery (ASR) System scheduled to come on line in 2017.

       Flow needs for this area can be handled from three sources.

           1. 12” Cornelius main line on the north side of Baseline that currently ends at East
              Lane
           2. 12” Cornelius main line on the south side of Baseline that currently ends at the
              Coastal Farm Store at about 336th Avenue
           3. Existing but unused transfer station from the Hillsboro 72” transmission line in
              Baseline to the Cornelius system at East Lane


       In summary, the City of Cornelius can easily serve the Northeast UGB area. The primary
       concern is the fact that most pipes in this area are substandard. Bringing this area up to
       current standards is an expensive proposition that is not currently programed into the
       Cornelius water rate structure. Therefore, improvements to the water infrastructure in
       this area will be required at the time of development. Until areas are annexed into the
       City the system within this area will remain within Hillsboro’s service district and will be
       maintained and operated by Hillsboro.


Water Infrastructure Needs – Southeast UGB Area
       The Southeast UGB area represents a clean slate in that the area contains almost no
       existing water infrastructure. The only public water facility in the area is a 2” plastic line
       from Baseline south along 345th to serve approximately 8 residents within ¼ mile of
       Baseline. Since most of these residents are outside the UGB expansion area, the City
       does not intend to upgrade this 2” plastic line in the foreseeable future. However, the
       south end of this line may be looped into the new water infrastructure in the UGB area
       to protect against an emergency such as a line break.


                                                                                                    2
       When developed, the Southeast UGB area will be served by 12” mains under the
       planned collector streets. The collector streets are expected to include: 29th south of
       Baseline, 26th and 20th south of Ginger, Dogwood east of 28th, and a new east-west
       collector south of the current city limits that connects 20th, 26thand 29th. All local streets
       will be underlain with 8” water mains, the minimum standard required by Cornelius.

       In addition, to provide adequate flow and pressure to this area at build-out, some
       improvements in the City’s existing water system may be required. The needed
       improvements will be determined when the City completes its water master plan
       update later this year. However, the improvements to the existing system that are likely
       to be needed at full development of the UGB area include:

           •   12” line to replace existing 8” line in Dogwood from 18th to 20th
           •   12” line to replace 8” line in 20th from Dogwood to Southeast UGB area
           •   12” line to replace 8” line in 26th from Dogwood to Southeast UGB area

       These improvements are not needed initially, but will be required as the area nears
       build-out. When the City’s water master plan update is completed in late 2015, the
       amount of development the existing system can support will be determined. For
       development that occurs before the master plan update is complete, the developer will
       be responsible for proving that the existing system can provide adequate flow and
       pressure to the UGB area. If adequate flow and pressure cannot be attained, the
       developer will need to make the improvements noted above.

       Storage needs for the Southeast UGB area can be handled by the City’s current 1.5 MG
       above ground reservoir and its 50+MG Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) System
       scheduled to come on line in 2017.


Water Infrastructure Costs – Southeast UGB Area
       All the new water mains in the Southeast UGB area will be installed and funded by
       developers. However, the City must pay for oversizing of lines greater than 8” size. In
       other words, while the developers are responsible for funding the installation of 8” lines
       under all the streets in this area, the City must fund the additional cost of 12” lines
       where they are needed. The cost of this upsizing of lines to 12” is estimated to be:

               12” oversize cost in UGB area = ~10,000 LF @ $20/LF = $200,000

       Furthermore, the City must fund improvements to piping outside the UGB area. These
       improvements are listed above and will cost approximately:

               12” replacement lines inside UGB area = ~2,200 LF @ $140/LF = $300,000



                                                                                                   3
       Water SDCs from the southeast UGB area are expected to be:

              1,100 single family residences @ $3,884 SDC per residence = ~$4M

       Therefore, the water SDCs captured from the new development in the southeast UGB
       area are more than adequate to fund the improvements to pipes needed to serve this
       area.


Recommendations
     In the Northeast UGB area, staff recommends the area continue to be served by the City
     of Hillsboro until parcels are annexed. At the time parcels are annexed into the City of
     Cornelius, Cornelius should take over the portion of Hillsboro’s system needed to serve
     the annexed parcel. Developers should pay for all improvements needed to bring lines
     up to City of Cornelius standards.

       In the Southeast UGB area, developers should design and install all water mains. The
       City shall pay for oversizing mains under collectors to 12” from the 8” standard size. The
       City shall also design, build, and fund improvements necessary to the water mains
       within the current City boundaries.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Transportation Planning Rule Findings 
The traffic analysis completed for the proposed Cornelius UGB expansion areas found the potential 
vehicle trip increase would not significantly impact the surrounding transportation system and would 
satisfy the requirements of OAR 660‐012‐0060. No capacity improvements to existing facilities beyond 
those identified in the RTP and Cornelius TSP are required to support the UGB expansion areas. Further 
analysis of Tualatin Valley Highway west of 345th Avenue should be included in the upcoming Cornelius 
TSP update to identify specific projects to serve fronting property needs for access, capacity and safety. 

Local Improvements 
Local roadway projects would be required to support the UGB expansion areas and provide adequate 
access and internal circulation. Based on the City’s functional classification designations13 and the future 
2040 PM peak hour volume forecasts, recommended local improvements were identified as shown in 
Table 11. Planning level cost estimates were developed for each roadway project based on the collector 
cross‐section with parking on both sides of the street (shown in Figure 9). If the collector facilities were 
constructed with a narrower cross‐section (shown in Figures 10 and 11) the costs would be lower.

Study Area
       The Urban Growth Expansion (UGB) area consists of two parts. The Northeast UGB area
       is primarily north of Baseline and south of the Council Creek flood plain, just east of the
       current City limits. The Southeast UGB area is north of the Tualatin River flood plain and
       west of 345th Avenue. These areas are shown in the map below.




       The terrain in these two areas is generally flat. The Northeast area largely slopes to the
       north toward Council Creek. The only waterway in this area is a large wetland area that
       separates the UGB expansion area from the current City boundary. This wetland area
       drains north toward Council Creek.

       The Southeast area primarily slopes to the south toward the Tualatin River. The only
       waterway in this area is an agricultural ditch that starts where 26th Avenue turns into
       Webb Road and then traverses in a south-southwest direction toward the Tualatin
       River.




                                                                                                 1
Existing Stormwater Facilities
        The only existing stormwater facilities in the Northeast UGB area are roadside and
        trackside ditches along Baseline, the north-south streets traversing the area, and the
        railroad north of Baseline.

       The stormwater facilities in the Southeast UGB area are limited to the roadside ditches
       on 345th Avenue and railroad ditches along the railroad south of Baseline.

       As development occurs, these facilities are expected to be replaced with facilities
       meeting current Clean Water Service (CWS) standards.


Stormwater Standards Overview
      Any new development in the UGB expansion areas must at a minimum meet the current
      Design and Construction (D&C) Standards for Sanitary Sewer and Surface Water
      Management issued by CWS.

       Some UGB expansion areas in Washington County, notably Tigard’s River Terrace and
       the unincorporated North Bethany, created additional stormwater standards that go
       beyond the D&C Standards. In the case of River Terrace, severe erosion in the stream
       corridors coming off the south side of Bull Mountain necessitated a more stringent
       approach to stormwater control in the area.

       In North Bethany’s case, CWS desired to incorporate extensive LIDA (low-impact
       development practices) into the area and pre-built a number of large regional facilities.
       This was deemed more desirable to the creation of individual stormwater facilities in
       each development phase.

       One downside of the North Bethany approach is that CWS has had difficulty keeping
       ahead of development with new facilities. Also, by CWS constructing regional facilities
       rather than each developer constructing their own facilities, North Bethany has a large
       stormwater fee or system development charge that is unique in Washington County.

       Finally, the D&C Standards issued by CWS are expected to change significantly as a
       result of a new MS4 permit from the State of Oregon, Department of Environmental
       Quality (DEQ) to CWS. One change in the new MS4 permit will be an increased level of
       treatment for stormwater. However, the most significant change in the standards is
       expected to be a requirement to deal with hydro-modification. Instituting this type of
       requirement is expected to create the need for very large detention and retention
       facilities on new development sites.




                                                                                                   2
Cornelius Plan
       Because Cornelius does not face the problems Tigard does on Bull Mountain and
       because the City does not have the staff to plan, design, and build regional facilities, as
       CWS is doing in North Bethany, Cornelius will require developers to meet the current
       stormwater standards issued by CWS. While this approach is not innovative, it has been
       used successfully for decades in urban Washington County to manage stormwater
       runoff.

        The only variations from the CWS standards are:

           1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems, e.g., Stormfilters, for
              treatment on parts of the system that the City must maintain in the future, i.e.,
              facilities to be dedicated to the City.
           2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
              facilities.

        The reason for the prohibition on proprietary systems is the additional maintenance
        burden these pose for the City at a time when stormwater maintenance funding is
        extremely limited. Likewise, the single-family lot LIDA facilities require on-going City
        inspection and oversight that the City does not have funding to undertake.


Costs
        Since developers will be responsible for designing and constructing stormwater facilities
        in the new UGB areas, the City will incur zero capital costs for these systems. The City
        will, however, incur, increased maintenance costs long-term, but these costs are funded
        by monthly stormwater fees payable by the new residents and businesses in the area.


Recommendations
     Staff recommends the City use the CWS D&C Standards that are applicable at the time
     of development to address stormwater issues in the UGB areas. Staff further
     recommends, the following two conditions be placed on all new development in these
     areas:

           1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems for treatment on parts
              of the system that the City must maintain in the future.
           2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
              facilities being used to meet subdivision stormwater quality or quantity
              requirements.




                                                                                                   3

Cornelius UGB Meeting #1

Opportunities & Constraints:

    Traffic Flow and timing along TV Highway – make sure service is maintained
    Access to TV Highway from 341st – Difficult now, called ODOT, don’t want it
     to get worse.
    345th Transients and homeless people along southern 345th – Also
     concerned about impacts from workers maintaining the proposed pump
     station.
    Concern about access for farming equipment from 345th/Cook area to TV
     Highway – Currently use 345 to access TV Highway – Don’t think it would be
     good to send equipment through subdivisions
    Stormwater should not be directed to existing drainages pipes on 345th
     (culverts) – There are impacts from when Coastal was developed
    Concern about police and fire service and how needs will be met with
     additional population
    Concern about what will occur behind Ginger Lane – Neighbors currently
     enjoy the open space behind them.
    Concerns about trails within the community, belief that new trails will
     provide a conduit for crime moving along the trail system, homeless people
     and concern about people defecating along the trails
    Concern about the potential for vandalism to irrigation pumping structures
     and irrigation pipe east and south of 345th
    Concerned about increase in traffic, potential for crime with increased
     traffic in the NE UGB roadways
    Diminished property value as a result of being included within the City
     (Who will compensate for this?) Belief that property values have been
     diminished as a result of being included within the UGB.
    334th, 338th, and 336th would like to keep rural character of the street.
     Potentially Low Density Residential – residents would prefer an Ag/Rural
     option
    341st is a mix of pro and con development.
 Concern about how the water serving NE UGB would change upon
  annexation. Will annexation and/or development trigger a transfer of water
  service from Hillsboro to Cornelius.
 Will the City promise not to annex the property in the NE (concern about
  forced annexation)?
 If connection to the City occurs for sanitary sewer. Will a nonremonstrance
  agreement be required for annexation?
 Concern about annexation (failed septic/DEQ). Residents are concerned
  that annexation will impact farm deferral.
 Concern about increased taxes, changed zoning, as a result of annexation.
 Surcharge on 338th? It was noted that one resident (not present) believes
  he paid a future payment for sanitary sewer.
 How did the floodplain get determined? Has it changed since 1998?
  Contention that the UGB boundary does not match the floodplain maps.
 It was requested that a hard copy survey be mailed to each lot for
  response.

SE UGB Area Discussion by Keith Jones, HHPR and Reah Flisakowski, DKS Associates

Keith

    -   Orientation of SE UGB Area.
           o Approximately 205 Acres
           o Boundary description shown to audience using map.
           o Described School Site and Discussion with Hillsboro School District. Depending
               upon what they construct in the future they will need about 40-acres for High
               School Site; 30-acres for a Middle School Site or 20-acres for a Elementary School.
           o Showed on map possible future roadway alignments as described within the City
               Transportation System Plan (TSP).
           o Described slope of area and the need for a sanitary pump station which will pump
               effluent up to S. Ginger Street where the existing sewer line will need to be
               upgraded. From the S. Ginger Street line, effluent will be directed to the main
               Clean Water Services (CWS) collection trunk lines.

Keith provide a brief overview of the City Zoning Districts that could be considered, all of which
are existing Zoning Districts in the City. No new zoning districts are anticipated.

    -   Zoning District

            o Single-Family, R-7: 6,000 sq. ft. minimum lot size; 4-5 dwellings per net acre;
              this is a low density residential zone.
               o Single-Family, R-10: 10,000 sq. ft. minimum lot size; 3 dwelling per net acres; this
                 is a low density residential zone.
               o Multi-Family, A-2; Various minimum lot sizes depending upon the proposed
                 development of a site. This zone can permit Apartments, Duplexes, Single-Family
                 Dwellings or Multi-Family dwellings with 3 or more dwelling units; 8-10
                 dwellings per net acres; this is a medium density residential zone.
               o Planned Unit Development, PUD. This is not an actual zoning designation, but
                 rather an overlay used with an underlying zoning district that provides flexibility
                 for a developer to create a development that results in a better finished product
                 other that what can be expected by using the base development requirements.

    -      Parks Master Plan

               o Showed on the map where the City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan conceptually
                 identifies the general area where a 15 to 20 acres park area could be located.

Q/C = Questions/Comment
A/C= Answer/Comment


Q/C.       Is there a first draft of the zoning map?
A/C.       No, not yet. The purpose of this meeting is to obtain feedback from the community and
           property owners as to the opportunities and constraints in each area. At the third
           neighborhood meeting to be scheduled in May the consultant team will provide a
           comprehensive plan designation map for review and comment by the community.

Reah provided a brief discussion about the Transportation facilities in the area and the 6 main
intersections in the SE UGB area that will be studied.

       -   Signalization

              o A new intersection along Baseline Street (State Highway 8, an Oregon Department
                of Transportation Facility, ODOT) will be needed. Due to the railway and existing
                intersections, a new signalized intersection will most likely be approved by ODOT
                at the intersection of Baseline Street and N. 29th Avenue. (near Murphy’s
                Furniture). This signal was identified in the City’s 2005 Transportation System Plan
                (TSP).
              o The railroad crossing at 345th most likely would be closed to allow for a crossing
                at 29th.
              o The final alignment of the roadways into the SE UGB area from a new signalized
                is not yet known at this time. The TSP shows a conceptual alignment that can be
                shifted as the roadway goes though final design.
              o Signalization elsewhere along Baseline for the SE UGB area is not likely due to the
                ‘alignment’ of existing intersections/roadways and inability to meet warrants.

   -       Traffic counts
          o Analysis of traffic counts in the area focuses on the afternoon (PM) peak hour,
            when the most volume of traffic occurs.
          o As development in the new UGB areas occurs, additional traffic studies will be
            required so the appropriate traffic mitigation devises/designs can be required as
            needed.

SE UGB area audience questions/concerns

Q/C = Questions/Comment
A/C= Answer/Comment

Q/C.   With more people coming into the City, why is Baseline Street (Hwy. 8) not getting bigger
       to accommodate traffic?
A/C.   ODOT has indicated that Hwy. 8 is not at capacity. Approximately 34,000 vehicles use
       the facility each day. As part of the UGB master planning process the City is required to
       look at the growth of the area and associated traffic impacts up to the year 2040. With the
       new UGB areas, there will likely be a new signal at the 29th Street intersection. However,
       the current design of the Hwy. 8 is not anticipated to be enlarged (new lanes) or
       significantly redesigned as it appears there is adequate capacity based on recent studies.

Q/C.   There is concern about safety, especially left hand turn movements onto Baseline (Highway
       8).
A/C.   The signalized lights are timed/linked to each other and should provide a ‘break’ in traffic
       to allow for left turns. However, there will be times that a person will have to wait for a
       few minutes before they can turn. Additional lighting at these intersections can improve
       safety and facilitate better turn movements.

Q/C.   What will the timing be in regards to a signalized intersection and improvements to other
       local streets, such as S. Dogwood Street if the school is not developed, prior to development
       further south?
A/C.   At the time of development the City will require a Traffic Study to be completed. Based
       upon the Study, a developer may be required to improve/provide street improvements so
       future traffic can be accommodated. At some point development will justify the need for
       the new signal at N. 29th Avenue and Baseline Street. If a signal is needed prior to the
       school being developed, then the City can require it to be installed by the developer who is
       triggering the need for the improvement.

Q/C.   Were street, sewer and property values considered along S. Linden Street and for the new
       sewer pump station? (concern about impacts to property values resulting from the location
       of new sewer pump station)
A/C.   A future pump station is a small enclosed structure that houses pumps. It is not a large
       open pit lagoon facility. There are similar structures in Cornelius and nearby communities.
       They are typically no larger than a typical single-family home. The City and Consultants
       are exploring options for upgrading the S. Linden Street sewer line, such as ‘Pipe Bursting’.
       Pipe Bursting is a method of replacing pipe without the need to dig trenches in the street.
       At the end of the process the City will understand what improvements will be necessary to
       support development and will be capable of planning for infrastructure improvements.

Q/C. There was a question about the UGB process and how the area was established. Some in
      the audience were not previously aware of the UGB area.
A/C. Michael Cerbone gave a brief overview of the UGB process. The new UGB area was
      brought into the City via a legislative action also referred to as the “Grand Bargain”. This
      occurred as a result of an appeal to the State of Oregon regarding the establishment of the
      UGB and Rural and Urban Reserves by Washington County and METRO. Oregon State
      Legislators enacted House Bill 4078 which created the new UGB areas in Cornelius, Forest
      Grove and Hillsboro. State Law requires that the City Comprehensively plan for the new
      UGB areas. The UGB adopted boundaries utilized the 100-year floodplain, which is why
      the boundary is oddly shaped. The City acknowledges that many property owners are
      unhappy with the way the State created the new UGB areas. A positive aspect of the way
      that land was brought into the UGB is that the City is exempt from having to meet all of
      METRO’s normal UGB planning processes. This has given Cornelius more flexibility,
      such as planning the areas for less density.

Q/C. Will the new future roadway through the school property be off-set?
A/C. At this time the exact alignment of the roadway is not known. However the roadway will
     be designed so it aligns with a new intersection at 29th. A good example is the signalization
     intersection at Baseline Street and S. 20th Avenue/N. 19th Avenue near Walgreens.

Q/C.   If my septic system fails and our property is on the east side of 345 th Avenue, will we be
       required to connect to City Service?
A/C.   No, the UGB ends at the east side of 345th Avenue. Therefore private property east of 345th
       is outside of the UGB. Current State law does not allow Cities to provide services to
       properties that are outside of their UGB area.

Q/C.   There is a wildlife corridor along the Tualatin River. When it floods, where will the
       wildlife go, if the area is developed?
A/C.   The concern was noted.

Q/C.   What is the estimated time of development?
A/C.   This planning project is looking for City Council adoption in fall of 2015. Afterwards,
       property owners can voluntarily begin the Annexations/Zone Map application process
       which can take around 6 months to process. Additional time is then required for the
       recording of a final plat and review of engineer drawings for public improvements. Prior
       to development in the SE area a Sanitary Sewer Pump Station must be designed and
       constructed. There is indication that Clean Water Services (CWS) may construct this
       facility, or a private developer may.

Q/C.   Will there be more street lights on Baseline Street (Hwy 8)? It is currently dark in places
       and it is difficult to see vehicles and pedestrians.
A/C.   The traffic consultant will look at this concern.
Q/C.   A new signalized intersection at the corner of N.29thAvenue and Baseline Street makes the
       most sense. A Local Improvement District (LID) has some of the facility in place, such as
       a right-hand turn lane. Will property owners that abut this intersection have to pay more?
A/C.   No. Development of the Intersection will be responsibility of the developer(s). Monies
       from other funding sources can also be used, such as funds from the County and
       Transportation Development Tax.

Q/C.   We bought a property that is along the City Limits. To the south, there is an open field that
       is part of the new UGB area. When we bought the home, the realtor indicated that our
       view of the field area behind our home would remain unobstructed. Is there a way the City
       can limit development behind our house and not impact our view? We were not notified of
       the meetings that are taking place.
A/C.   No, the City cannot preclude a property owners rights to develop their property. The City
       is making every effort to contact affected property owners. If you did not receive a notice
       please sign the sign-in sheet or contact Michael Cerbone Community Development to be
       included on the mailing/contact list or to express your concerns/comments.

Q/C.   Will we have a say/part into the future zoning?
A/C.   Yes, a third neighborhood meeting is planned to present the future zoning for the areas, at
       this meeting public input will be received. . There will also be opportunities through your
       comments/concerns being shared with the Technical Advisory Committee which will make
       a recommendation to staff. Staff will subsequently make a recommendation to the City of
       Cornelius Planning Commission. The Planning Commission will then make a
       recommendation to the City of Cornelius City Council for a final decision. The Planning
       Commission and City Council will provide opportunities for your written comments and
       testimony as well.

Q/C.   Will we have a right to purchase and/or right to limit development near us that would
       impact our view?
A/C.   You have a right to contact the property owner and purchase their property if it’s available.
       If a development application that requires land use notice is received, you will be notified
       and will have an opportunity to submit comment on that application.

NE UGB Area Discussion by Keith Jones, HHPR and Reah Flisakowski, DKS Associates

Keith

    -   Orientation of NE UGB Area.
           o Approximately 175 Acres
           o Boundary description shown to audience using map.
           o Described two main areas inside of this region. The western and eastern half. Each
               area has its own unique features and challenges.
           o Showed on map possible future roadway alignments as described within the City
               Transportation System Plan (TSP).
           o Described difficulties to expanding sanitary services to this area due to existing
               72” water main location and the location of the sanitary trunk line that is outside
               of UBG area to the north.

Keith provide a brief overview of the City Zoning Districts that could be considered, all of which
are existing Zoning Districts in the City. No new zoning districts are anticipated.

    -   Zoning District

            o Single-Family, R-7: 6,000 sq. ft. minimum lot size; 4-5 dwellings per net acre;
              this is a low density residential zone.
            o Single-Family, R-10: 10,000 sq. ft. minimum lot size; 3 dwelling per net acres; this
              is a low density residential zone.
            o Multi-Family, A-2; Various minimum lot sizes depending upon the proposed
              development of a site. This zone can permit Apartments, Duplexes, Single-Family
              Dwellings or Multi-Family dwellings with 3 or more dwelling units; 8-10
              dwellings per net acres; this is a medium density residential zone.
            o Planned Unit Development, PUD. This is not an actual zoning designation, but
              rather a an overlay used with an underlying zoning district that provides flexibility
              for a developer to create a development that results in a better finished product
              other that what can be expected by using the base development requirements.
            o Commercial, C-2.
            o Manufactured Home Park, MHP. This zoning district is Comprehensively Planned
              as a Medium Density Residential Use.

            o There is an area just east of Coastal Farm & Ranch that most likely would be
              Comprehensive Planned for Commercial, because it directly abuts Baseline Street
              (Hwy 8) and is abuts a commercial use.

            o The existing trailer park in the western area of the NE UGB area would most likely
              be zoned as a Manufactured Home Park, so they can continue the existing use.
            o The eastern half of the NE UGB area, due to development pattern and large lots,
              will be recommended to be zoned Single-Family, R-10, a low density residential
              zone.



    -   Parks Master Plan

            o Showed on the map where the City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan conceptually
              identifies the area where a smaller park area could be located.
            o The Parks Master Plan can be amended in the future to address trails in the area.
            o A park in the area would be discouraged from being developed along Baseline
              Street.

Reah provides a brief discussion about the Transportation facilities in the NE UGB area.

    -   Signalization

           o A new intersection in this area would be difficult to support, unless there is a new
             roadway to provide east-west connectivity for the entire area back to the signalized
             intersection. Currently there is no internal connectivity, which ODOT would
             require for a signal to be installed. There is no simple solution to provide this east-
             west route without impacting existing homes or planned facilities.
           o If a signal were possible and could be supported, it would most likely be situated at
             NW 336th Avenue, across from Coastal Farms.
           o The railroad to the north has a limited number of crossings which make connectivity
             even more challenging.
           o There may be enough development to warrant a speed study of this section of
             Baseline Street in the future, which could justify reducing traffic speed limits.
           o The likelihood of Tri-Met building light-rail service along the northern tracts,
             which are owned by ODOT, is not listed as a high priority and will likely not happen
             in the near future.


Q/C = Questions/Comment
A/C= Answer/Comment


Q/C.    Does ODOT think clearly? i.e. placement of raised medians. (concern was raised about
        the possibility of medians that would remove the ability for left turns)
A/C.    The comment was noted for future discussion.

Q/C.    The raised medians affect emergency vehicle access.
A/C.    Currently if emergency vehicles have to get around traffic that is blocked by a median, they
        will go around in the opposite travel lane.
Q/C.   How can a property be served with utilities, such as sewer?
A/C.   There are basically two methods. 1). As a property owner you choose to annex and connect
       to City services. Or 2). Your septic system fails and the State (DEQ) requires you to
       connect if you are within 300 feet of an existing available sewer line. If you are forced to
       connect, the City will require that you sign a non-remonstrance agreement which will state
       that when your property becomes eligible, (i.e. contiguous) you will consent to annexation.
       As part of this process the City will identify the manner in which each property will be
       served with water and sewer.

Q/C. If annexed, can we maintain our City of Hillsboro Water service/bill? The cost of Cornelius
     water is extremely higher, for the same water.
A/C. Staff will examine at what point Hillsboro Water Users will be converted to City of
     Cornelius Water Users.

Q/C.   Can the northern railroad be used to create a new road for vehicle connectivity?
A/C.   Most likely not. Railroads usually do not give up their right to their right-of-way. This
       ROW is also identified for a future extension of light rail and a new trail.

Q/C.   Please clarify forced annexation.
A/C.   If your septic system fails, the State (DEQ) will require you to connect to a sewer line, if
       available and within 300 feet. If you are forced to connect, the City will require that you
       either annex into the City or sign a non-remonstrance agreement which will state that when
       your property becomes eligible, (i.e. contiguous) you will consent to annexation.

Q/C.   Please clarify a non-remonstrance agreement?
A/C.   If you are forced to connect to the City’s sanitary sewer system and your property is not
       contiguous (touching) the City, the City will require that you sign a non-remonstrance
       agreement which will state that when your property becomes eligible, (i.e. contiguous) you
       will consent to annexation.

Q/C.   How much weight do we have in determining zoning?
A/C.   Your comments/concerns from all neighborhood meetings for the project will be given to
       the Technical Advisory Committee who will make a recommendation to Staff who will
       make a recommendation to the City of Cornelius Planning Commission. The Planning
       Commission will then make a recommendation to the City of Cornelius City Council for a
       final decision. These are public meetings that are open to the public. The Planning
       Commission and City Council will provide opportunities for your verbal and written
       comments and testimony.

Q/C.   Will there be notice of upcoming meetings?
A/C.   Yes. Notice till be mailed, posted on the City website, posted on the reader board on the
       side of the Council Chambers and posted in the paper.

Q/C.   Do the traffic studies account for accidents?
A/C.   Yes, for the volume of traffic there are no major concerns in regards to accidents.
Q/C.   Does the traffic study look at the possibility of connection via the railway?
A/C.   No, it does not consider vehicle connectivity along the railway. However it does account
       for future pedestrian connectivity.

Q/C.   If I annex, do I have to connect to City sewer.
A/C.   No, not until your septic system fails. When it fails, you will be required to connect if the
       sanitary sewer system is available (within 300 feet of your property).

Q/C.   Can NW Iona Ct. be zoned R-10?
A/C.   Based upon the development and size of the lots, it is a good candidate for the R-10 zone.

Q/C.   My property has a significant slope to it. How will this affect development?
A/C.   For properties with slopes, this is considered when development occurs. Through
       engineering and design a property with steep topography can typically be safely developed.

Q/C.   Does the 300-feet state requirement keep moving if a property owner nearby extends the
       sewer line?
A/C.   Yes, once the sewer line is moved and it is available the measurement is taken from the
       end of the line. Therefore, it may through time come closer to a property.

Q/C.   Whose responsibility (who bears the cost) is it to extend a sewer line?
A/C.   It is the responsibility of those who want or need to extend it. Primarily developers of a
       property are responsible for the extension of utility lines.

Q/C.   If annexed, where does my tax money go? (i.e. Fire Department)
A/C.   Monies go to the appropriate taxing district and agencies.
Cornelius Urban Growth
Boundary Expansion
Transportation Report




September 18, 2015
This report presents our recommendations for the Cornelius urban growth boundary (UGB) expansion
areas transportation element. The transportation element documents a review of existing
transportation conditions and applicable standards, future transportation operations with the proposed
Comprehensive Plan amendments, and transportation system needs following Transportation Planning
Rule (TPR) guidelines. The report also identifies elements to support a future update of the Cornelius
Transportation System Plan aimed to incorporate the UGB expansion areas.

STUDY AREA
The City of Cornelius covers approximately 2 square miles and is located in Washington County, just east
of Forest Grove and one mile west of Hillsboro. The UGB expansion consists of two areas east of the city
limits, one north of Tualatin Valley Highway and one south of Tualatin Valley Highway.

The project study area (shown in Figure 1) is generally bordered by 19th/20th Avenues to the west, the
flood plain to the south, 345th Avenue to the east (south of Tualatin Valley Highway), 331st Avenue to the
east and the flood plain to the north (north of Tualatin Valley Highway). Six study intersections were
selected for analysis based on proximity and potential impacts from the UGB expansion:

    •   Tualatin Valley Highway (Baseline Street, Route 8)/20th Avenue
    •   Tualatin Valley Highway (Baseline Street, Route 8)/Fred Meyer Driveway
    •   Tualatin Valley Highway (Baseline Street, Route 8)/26th Avenue and S Webb Road
    •   Tualatin Valley Highway (Baseline Street, Route 8)/29th Avenue (NW Hobbs Road)
    •   Tualatin Valley Highway (Baseline Street, Route 8)/345th Avenue
    •   20th Avenue/Dogwood Street

TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Evaluating the transportation impacts of the UGB expansion requires an understanding of the current
transportation facilities in this area. The land in the southeast expansion area is currently used for rural
residential and agriculture, while the land in the northeast expansion area is primarily low density
residential or vacant. As a result, transportation facilities do exist but many are not constructed to urban
standards. This section includes descriptions of existing infrastructure available to serve pedestrian,
bicycle, transit and motor vehicle modes of travel.

Pedestrian Facilities
Sidewalks along key roadways within the study area are shown in Figure 2 based on available Metro GIS
data. Sidewalks are generally provided on both sides of the street throughout the study area, with the
following notable key gaps:

    •   South side of Tualatin Valley Highway between Fred Meyer and 29th Avenue (partial sidewalks)
        and east of 345th Avenue beyond the study area
    •   North side of Tualatin Valley Highway east of East Lane beyond the study area
    •   20th Avenue between the north Walgreen’s driveway (west side) and just south of Davis Street
        (east side) to the north Cornelius city limits
    •   26th Avenue and 29th Avenue north of Tualatin Valley Highway to the railroad tracks
    •   341st, 338th, 336th, and 334th Avenues north of Tualatin Valley Highway

In general, the pedestrian network provides connectivity to most streets in the study area. However, the
current gaps in the pedestrian system along 29th Street do not allow pedestrians in Cornelius, north of
the 3F line, to access the Tualatin Valley Highway. No marked pedestrian crossings are currently
provided on Tualatin Valley Highway.

Sidewalks have not been fully inventoried in the recently expanded UGB areas, but observations using
available aerial photography indicate that very few sidewalks are available in these areas.

Bicycle Facilities
Metro’s existing bicycle designations are identified in Figure 3. There are designated bicycle lanes on
Tualatin Valley Highway through the study area. Dogwood Street, between 20th Avenue and 26th
Avenue, and 26th Avenue, between Dogwood Avenue and Tualatin Valley Highway are designated by
Metro as “low traffic through streets”. In addition, field review indicates that bicycle facilities are also
provided on the following roadways:

    •   20th Avenue between Tualatin Valley Highway and north Walgreen’s Access (west side) and
        North Davis Street (east side)
    •   20th Avenue between Tualatin Valley Highway and South Alpine Street
    •   29th Avenue between Tualatin Valley Highway and approximately 500 feet north of Tualatin
        Valley Highway

No other key study area roads have bike lanes. However, most local streets in the area serve relatively
low traffic volumes, which are appropriate for shared use by bicycles and motor vehicles.

Public Transit
TriMet is the regional transit provider for the Portland metro area and operates one bus route within
Cornelius, #57 – TV Highway/Forest Grove which provides frequent service with 15-minute headways
daily. Within the study area, between North 20th Avenue and 331st Avenue, there are currently eight
scheduled transit stops westbound and nine stops eastbound. Existing transit facilities are shown in
Figure 4. Bus shelters and bus turn-outs are provided at several of the stops in the study area. The stop
locations and daily ridership are summarized in Table 1 below.

Motor Vehicle Facilities
Field inventories were conducted to determine characteristics of roadways within the study area. Data
collected included posted speed limits, roadway lanes, lane configurations, and intersection controls.
These characteristics define corridor capacity and operating speeds through the street system, which
affect travel path choices for drivers in the study area. The summary of study area roadway
characteristics is listed in Table 2.

The key routes through the area are Tualatin Valley Highway and 20th Avenue, which are classified as
arterials by the Cornelius Transportation System Plan. Tualatin Valley Highway is classified by ODOT as a
Statewide Highway. In addition to the City’s standards and guidelines, ODOT’s standards and design
guidelines would apply to Tualatin Valley Highway. South 20th Avenue, Dogwood Street, 26th Avenue and
North 29th Avenue are classified as collectors.

Transportations Opportunities and Constraints
The most significant constraints in the recently expanded UGB area are the railroad tracks just north and
south of Tualatin Valley Highway. These provide significant constraints on north-south access through
the area.

There is a site owned by the Hillsboro School District just south of Tualatin Valley Highway between SW
345th Avenue and the existing neighborhoods to the west. The logical extension of Dogwood Street into
the recently expanded UGB area would bisect this site. Depending on the future use of the site, this may
be acceptable (depending on whether an elementary and middle school or a high school is developed). If
the school district determines that the land should be used for a high school, an analysis must be
undertaken to see if Dogwood Street can be incorporated into the site. Dogwood Street may need to be
aligned through the property as far to the south as possible.

Turns from all side streets onto Tualatin Valley Highway are difficult due to the high traffic volume and
relatively high speeds on Tualatin Valley Highway. For safety purposes, raised medians in targeted
locations may need to be considered, restricting turns from side streets to right-in/right-out only. While
these access restrictions would be inconvenient for those using the side streets, they would help
prevent crashes related to vehicles turning left or crossing the highway.

Access spacing requirements constrain the potential locations for north-south connections through the
UGB expansion area.

Proper roadway access spacing is important to maintain operating characteristics and safety. While all
parcels are allowed access, it is desired that access to parcels along major roadways be limited to side
streets or consolidated. When roadway access points are located too frequently along a roadway, safety
and roadway capacity are diminished. Access management practices can help roadways operate more
efficiently and include closure, consolidation, or relocation of accesses. It is best to incorporate
appropriate access spacing practices upon initial development or redevelopment to limit the amount of
management required in the future. Access management standards vary depending on posted speed on
the roadway. Access spacing standards for study area roadways are identified in Table 3.

Mobility Standards
Consideration of intersection operations is important to ensure mobility needs of the transportation
system are being met. The performance standard for intersections controlled by the City of Cornelius is
Level of Service (LOS) D during the PM peak hour of the day. 3 The performance standard for
intersections controlled by ODOT is based on the functional classification of the facility. For Tualatin
Valley Highway, the performance standard is a maximum v/c ratio of 0.99 for both the first and second
peak hour. 4

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The following sections summarize the current conditions for traffic volumes, study intersection
operations, and collision data assessment.

Existing Motor Vehicle Volumes
The existing intersections within the study area were selected for focused analysis in order to address
areas of concern along major roadways and to monitor impacts of potential build-out within the recent
UGB expansion. Intersection turn movement counts were conducted during the weekday PM peak hour
(4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) at the study area intersections 5. These counts were adjusted to reflect design hour
volumes (30th Highest Hour - 30 HV) based on ODOT’s methodology. 6 The count data was then used as a
basis for evaluating traffic performance at the study intersections for existing PM peak hour conditions.
The existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at study intersections are shown in Figure 5.

Existing Intersection Operations
The PM peak hour intersection volumes were used to determine the existing study intersection
operating conditions based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual 7 (HCM) methodology for signalized
and the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology for unsignalized intersections. The results
of this analysis are listed in Table 4 for the PM peak hour. The intersection performance measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) for the applicable agency are also provided in Table 4. As listed, each of the study
intersections meets its respective mobility standard during the PM peak hour.

Safety Assessment
Crash data for the most recent three year period (2011 – 2013) were obtained from ODOT for the
calculation of crash rates for study area intersections, as shown in Table 5. Crash rates were calculated
as the number of crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV), based on the number of crashes and the
annual average total entering volume. ODOT does not have an intersection crash rate standard. Crash
rates over 1.0 crashes per MEV should be flagged for further investigation. All of the study intersection
had crash rates of less than 1.0 crashes per MEV.

ODOT has a Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) that it uses for the identification and analysis of locations
on the state highway system with potential safety needs. Each year, the system is used to produce a list
of sites within each ODOT Region that are ranked within the top 5th or 10th percentiles of all SPIS
locations statewide. The SPIS score is based on three years of crash data and reflects crash frequency,
crash rate, and crash severity. There are no top 5th or 10th percentile ODOT SPIS locations (2010 – 2012)
in the study area.

Washington County also maintains a SPIS list as a screening tool to identify potentially hazardous
intersections. The SPIS score is based on three years of crash data for the County roadway system and
reflects crash frequency, crash rate, and crash severity. There are no Washington County SPIS locations
(2010 – 2012) in the study area.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPACTS
The potential transportation system impacts of the Cornelius UGB expansion areas are summarized in
the following sections. The future conditions evaluation includes an overview of the Transportation
Planning Rule, future land use, forecasting methodology, summary of planned roadway improvements,
and study area motor vehicle intersection capacity analysis with the UGB expansion in place.

Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) Overview
The Transportation Planning Rule 8 requires that, where an amendment to a comprehensive plan or
zoning regulation would significantly affect an existing or planned transportation facility, the local
government shall put in place measures that assure that allowed land uses are consistent with the
function, capacity, and performance standards of the facility. The recent Cornelius UGB expansion
proposes an amendment to the comprehensive plan map. Therefore, the proposed map changes must
comply with the TPR.

The traffic analysis required by the TPR measures impacts by estimating the change in vehicle trips on
the transportation system resulting from a comprehensive plan or zoning amendment. Generally, the
analysis procedure estimates the transportation system’s performance under a proposed
comprehensive plan/zoning designation reasonable worst-case scenario. If the proposed scenario is
found to not have significant transportation system impacts (e.g., fewer estimated vehicle trips
generated than under existing comprehensive plan designation or insignificant offsite impacts from
additional vehicle trips), no mitigation measures are required. If significant transportation system
impacts are found, any improvements needed to maintain adequate operations will be identified for
incorporation in the city’s Transportation System Plan (TSP).

Future Land Use
Land use is a key factor in developing a functional transportation system. The amount of land that is
planned to be developed, the type of land uses, and how the land uses are mixed together have a direct
relationship to the expected demands on the transportation system. Understanding the amount and
type of land use is critical to maintaining or enhancing transportation system operations.

The UGB for the Portland metropolitan area was expanded in 2014 by about 345 acres east of Cornelius
to accommodate future growth. This land is currently under several Washington County land use
districts including Rural Residential, Agriculture and Forest and Future Development. Through this
planning effort, the land will be converted to City of Cornelius urban Comprehensive Plan designations.
Preliminary designations were developed based on input from city staff and the community. The
proposed designations were assessed to determine the amount of buildable land and household and
employment growth that could result in each of the expansion areas under a reasonable worst-case
condition. The reasonable worst case includes consideration of maximum potential build-out under
allowed zoning given topographic, environmental, and likely market constraints.

Under the proposed comprehensive plan designations for the UGB expansion area, a compatible zoning
designation was applied to conduct the transportation impact analysis. Each of these zoning
designations was assessed to determine a reasonable worst-case level of development. Household
estimates were based on zoning density requirements while employee estimates were based on
employment density data for similar uses. The estimated growth in households and employees for each
expansion area are shown in Table 6.

Forecasting Methodology
A determination of future street network needs requires the ability to accurately forecast travel demand
resulting from estimates of future population and employment for the Cornelius UGB expansion area,
and the rest of the City and Metro region. The objective of the transportation planning process is to
provide the information necessary for making decisions about how and where improvements should be
made to create a safe and efficient transportation system that provides travel options.

The travel demand forecasting process generally involves estimating travel patterns for new
development based on the decisions and preferences demonstrated by existing residents, employers
and institutions around the region. Travel demand models are mathematical tools that help us
understand future commuter, school and recreational travel patterns including information about the
length, mode and time of day a trip will be made.

Transportation Analysis Zone (TAZ) household and employee allocations from the current Metro 2040
planning horizon year reflect the assumption that the two UGB expansion areas would see significant
development by 2040. Each of the two expansion areas is contained within a single TAZ, as shown in
Figure 6 below. The two TAZs, 1386 (southeast area) and 1381 (northeast area), also include areas
currently within the UGB (pink) and areas outside of the proposed UGB expansion area (white).

The land uses allocated in the Metro 2040 model TAZs are significantly different from what is estimated
under a reasonable worst case buildout for the proposed comprehensive plan designations (shown in
Table 6). Table 7 shows the difference in household and employee totals for the two TAZs, and includes
development in the expansion areas, as well as development within the current UGB and in the rural
area for each TAZ. Note Metro base year land use data at the TAZ level is confidential, therefore only
changes to the TAZ land uses can be reported.

Vehicle trips that would be generated by the Cornelius UGB expansion were estimated by applying the
Metro 2040 model trip generation rates by land use type. The future 2040 PM peak hour trip table in
the Metro 2040 model was modified to reflect the reasonable worst-case land use under proposed
comprehensive plan. In the case of the southeast expansion area, the trips were factored up based on a
regression analysis of model land use and trip generation in the far west Metro area. Similarly, trips
were factored down in the northeast expansion area. Overall, the Cornelius UGB expansion is expected
to generate about the same number of PM peak hour trips as forecasted in the 2040 Metro model. The
difference in the number of trips generated by each TAZ between the 2040 Metro model and the
proposed UGB expansion is shown in Table 7.

                                                                 Trips           Trips
1386 (SE Area)                  + 593            - 159           + 186            + 46            + 232

1381 (NE Area)                  - 193            - 313           - 128           - 148             - 266

The 2040 Metro model was refined with new and relocated model link connectors to better represent
the loading of trips for TAZ 1386 (southeast area) and 1381 (northeast area) to the regional network. A
new 2040 trip assignment was run in the refined model using the modified trip table and the planned
roadway improvements listed in the next section. The modified trip table reflected the estimated land
use forecasts for each expansion area shown in Table 6.

A post processing technique following NCHRP 255 methodology 9 was used to refine model growth
forecasts to the traffic volume forecasts used for 2040 intersection analysis. These volumes were then
used to analyze and determine future impacts from the proposed UGB expansion areas on the future
roadway network. Future 2040 volume forecasts at the study intersections are shown in Figure 7.

Planned Study Area Roadway Improvements
The Metro 2040 RTP and Cornelius TSP 10 include several future roadway improvements with reasonable
funding sources within or near the UGB expansion area. The planned improvements reflected in the
2040 travel demand model that affect the 2040 traffic forecasts and intersection operations analysis
include:

       •   Davis Street extension from 19th Avenue to 29th Avenue (RTP #10799)
       •   Holladay Street extension from 10th Avenue to 19th Avenue (RTP #10796 and #10797)

       •   Evergreen Road widening to 5 lanes between Glencoe Road and 25th Avenue (RTP #10836)

       •   Glencoe Road widening to 3 lanes between Evergreen Road and Jackson Avenue (RTP #10591)
       •   New traffic signal at the 29th Avenue/Tualatin Valley Highway intersection (RTP #10802)

       •   Extension of 29th Avenue south of Tualatin Valley Highway, realigns to 345th Avenue south of
           Dogwood Street (TSP)
       •   Close 345th Avenue railroad crossing and construction new railroad crossing on 29th Avenue
           extension south of Tualatin Valley Highway (TSP)
The Evergreen Road and Glencoe Road widening projects combined with the Holladay Street extension
add vehicle capacity to the future network and appear to attract trips to the Cory Street – Hornecker
Road – Susbauer east-west route between Hillsboro and Cornelius. This alternative route lowers the
east-west volume growth on Tualatin Valley Highway through the study area.

Future Intersection Operations
A capacity analysis of study area intersections was completed for 2040 with the proposed UGB
expansion area development. The results of the capacity analysis are listed in Table 7, which indicates
that all study intersections would meet standards. The 345th Avenue/Tualatin Valley Highway
intersection would operate with a v/c ratio of 0.98 for the northbound left turn movement. Planned
improvements include the closure of the 345th Avenue railroad crossing south of Tualatin Valley
Highway. With this improvement, the traffic volumes on the south leg are expected to remain low and
not trigger the need for capacity improvements. Other unsignalized side street approaches to TV
Highway within the study area would have traffic operations similar to 345th Avenue. The intersection
performance measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for the applicable agency are also provided in Table 7.

Trip Generation Sensitivity Assessment - NE Area Commercial
To better understand the potential traffic impacts of
future development in the northeast area
commercial designation (6-acre parcel shown in
Figure 8), a trip generation sensitivity assessment
was conducted. An alternative trip generation
estimate was calculated using Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) methodology 11 based
on reasonable worst case development scenario of
C-2 zoning that assumes a new supermarket and a
fast food restaurant with a drive-through window.
Trip generation calculations for the ITE estimate
approach are shown in Table 8.                                   Figure 8: NE Area Commercial Designation

In order to evaluate potential impacts at the nearest study intersections along the Tualatin Valley
Highway, pass-by trips and diverted linked trips were subtracted to estimate total primary trips. Pass-by
trips and diverted linked trips are trips that affect turning movement volumes at the commercial site’s
access, but do not affect overall trip growth at adjacent intersections along the highway. This resulted in
170 new trips (141 generated by the supermarket and 29 generated by the restaurant) that would not
otherwise occur on the system. Our comparison of the ITE trip generation approach to the 2040 Metro
model trip generation is shown in Table 9.

    Future 2040 Metro model trip rates are based on number of employees. Building area estimate assumed 1.5
retail employees per 1,000 SF.

    ITE trip rates used in this analysis are based on building square footage.

The ITE trip generation approach for the commercial parcel results in 33 additional inbound trips and 3
additional outbound trips compared to the Metro model approach. These additional trips were
evaluated at the nearest intersection to the west and to the east of the commercial parcel along the
Tualatin Valley Highway. Trip assignment onto Tualatin Valley Highway (rounded to nearest 5 vehicles)
was based on the proportion of eastbound and westbound volumes forecasted in the 2040 PM peak
hour, resulting in 15 additional eastbound trips through the 29th Avenue/Tualatin Valley Highway
intersection and 20 additional westbound trips through the 334th Avenue/Tualatin Valley Highway
intersection. Outbound trip generation difference was insignificant and therefore not evaluated. Future
intersection performance under each trip generation approach is shown in Table 10.

Future operations with the ITE approach showed no impact to operations at 29th Avenue/Tualatin Valley
Highway compared to the forecast based on the Metro regional travel demand model. This is because
the additional trips estimated by the ITE approach were inbound trips to the commercial site traveling
eastbound through the intersection. Since the eastbound through was not a critical movement, the 15
new trips did not affect the delay or volume-to-capacity calculations for the overall intersection.

At the 334th Avenue/Tualatin Valley Highway intersection, future operations with the ITE approach
showed minimal impact to operations. The addition of 20 eastbound trips to Tualatin Valley Highway
slightly increased the 334th Avenue southbound volume-to-capacity ratio from 0.78 to 0.80 which is well
within agency mobility targets.

The trip generation sensitivity assessment found no traffic impacts triggered by future commercial
development in the northeast area along Tualatin Valley Highway. Due to the estimated high level of trip
generation from the commercial development (up to 638 PM peak hour trips as shown in Table 8), there
may be localized traffic impacts at the development access on Tualatin Valley Highway. Potential
mitigations may include the addition of a traffic signal and/or access management strategies depending
on the size, land use and layout of future development.

SE AREA DEVELOPMENT PHASING ASSESSMENT
An assessment of future traffic volumes on the collector street connections to the SE area was
conducted to determine if phased buildout of the UGB expansion area would be desirable to manage
potential volume impacts. In general, both 20th Avenue and 26th Avenue are two-lane facilities with
urban improvements (curb, sidewalk and street lighting), fronting single-family driveways and low use
on-street parking. Based on these roadway characteristics, setting a desirable maximum volume of 500
vehicles per hour would support neighborhood livability goals. Hourly traffic volumes outside the
morning and evening commute hours would be considerably lower.

With the planned local street network complete and three connections to Tualatin Valley Highway, the
estimated PM peak hour traffic volumes on 20th, 26th and 29th Avenue would each be well below the 500
vehicle per hour goal. However, portions of the southeast expansion area could develop prior to
construction of the 29th Avenue extension, increasing traffic demand on 20th and 26th Avenue. To
achieve livability goals, development connecting to 20th Avenue should be limited to 130 residential
units and development connecting to 26th Avenue should be limited to 260 residential units prior to
construction of the 29th Avenue connection to Tualatin Valley Highway. If development constructs a
roadway connection within the southeast area between 20th and 26th Avenue, then a combined
development limit of 390 residential units could be applied.

ROADWAY AND TRAIL CROSS-SECTIONS
The collector facility cross-sections were updated for the southeast expansion area to reduce right-of-
way requirements and encourage active transportation by providing comfortable, low-stress routes
while still accommodating the needs of motor vehicles. The recommended collector cross-sections,
shown in Figures 9 to 11, were developed in coordination with the City of Cornelius. There are three
options for on-street parking; parking both sides, parking one side and no parking. Cyclists would share
the travel lane with vehicles which is acceptable for low volume and low speed facilities (typically less
than 5,000 vehicles per day and 25 miles per hour). The appropriate collector cross-section will be
selected by the City during the development phase based on criteria such as fronting land use,
estimated parking demand, topography, and environmental constraints.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Transportation Planning Rule Findings
The traffic analysis completed for the proposed Cornelius UGB expansion areas found the potential
vehicle trip increase would not significantly impact the surrounding transportation system and would
satisfy the requirements of OAR 660-012-0060. No capacity improvements to existing facilities beyond
those identified in the RTP and Cornelius TSP are required to support the UGB expansion areas. Further
analysis of Tualatin Valley Highway west of 345th Avenue should be included in the upcoming Cornelius
TSP update to identify specific projects to serve fronting property needs for access, capacity and safety.

Local Improvements
Local roadway projects would be required to support the UGB expansion areas and provide adequate
access and internal circulation. Based on the City’s functional classification designations 13 and the future
2040 PM peak hour volume forecasts, recommended local improvements were identified as shown in
Table 11. Planning level cost estimates were developed for each roadway project based on the collector
cross-section with parking on both sides of the street (shown in Figure 9). If the collector facilities were
constructed with a narrower cross-section (shown in Figures 10 and 11) the costs would be lower.

The remaining roadways needed to support future development would function as local streets. The
preliminary alignment for the recommended collector facilities are shown on Figure 7. These alignments
are conceptual and will be refined with further engineering analysis prior to construction.

Policies and Standards
New policies and standards should be adopted to support the UGB expansion areas:

    •    Development should be limited to 130 residential units connecting to 20th Avenue and 260
         residential units connecting to 26th Avenue prior to construction of the 29th Avenue connection
         to Tualatin Valley Highway. With a roadway connection between 20th and 26th Avenue, a
         combined development limit of 390 residential units should be applied.
    •    Roadway and trail cross-sections shown in Figures 9 to 14 should be incorporated into the
         Cornelius TSP.

                                                     COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




Executive Summary
Trail Purpose
The Council Creek Regional Trail will be a multiuse pathway for pedestrians, bicyclists,
and other nonmotorized travelers for both recreational and transportation purposes. The
trail will extend almost 15 miles from the Banks-Vernonia Trail in Banks to the TriMet
Blue Line MAX station in downtown Hillsboro. The regional trail will connect the cities of
Banks, Forest Grove, Cornelius and Hillsboro, a large expanse of productive farmlands
between Banks and Forest Grove, and some smaller areas of still unincorporated land
within the urban growth boundary (UGB) between Forest Grove and Hillsboro.

This regional trail will pass through rural, suburban, and urban areas—residential
neighborhoods, farms, downtowns, commercial, and industrial; cross or follow state
highways Oregon 6, Oregon 8, and Oregon 47; and numerous urban and rural roadways;
and follow and cross an Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) owned rail line.
Council Creek will connect to six other existing or planned regional trails and greenways,
and to local trail systems.

Study Area
The Council Creek Regional Trail study area consisted of two corridors—North-South
and West-East. Smaller segments within these two corridors were identified for planning
purposes. Some segment boundaries were modified as outcomes of the existing
conditions and trail alignment analysis phases of the master planning process. Two
segments defined earlier in the process were combined, and some trail alignments were
initially considered that were outside of the original segment boundaries.

COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




                  Master Plan
                  The Council Creek Regional Trail Master Plan is the culmination of a community vision
                  that stretches back almost a decade. Work on the master plan began over 2 years ago.
                  The master plan will provide implementation guidance as local and regional partners
                  embark on efforts to fund, design and build the trail.

                  The master plan is the product of a combined effort by local, regional, and state
                  governments, a local stakeholder advisory committee, and the many individuals and
                  groups that contributed their ideas. The active government partners are the Cities of
                  Banks, Forest Grove, Cornelius, and Hillsboro, as well as Washington County, Metro
                  and ODOT. Some or all of these jurisdictions may be responsible for the final design,
                  engineering and building of sections of the trail.

                  In the course of master plan development, trail sections were adjusted or eliminated; trail
                  alignments were decreased, altered or added; and some underlying assumptions were
                  modified, all to reflect partner, public, and stakeholder comments and recommendations.
                  All illustrated trail alignments and trail types in the master plan are plan level, meaning
                  that they have not been subject to survey, final design, or engineering.

                  The entire process of the Council Creek Regional Trail Master Plan is documented in
                  three plan reports that are included as appendices to the master plan report:
                     •	 Plan Report No. 1 – Existing Conditions (February 2014)
                     •	 Plan Report No. 2 – Trail Alignment Analysis (July 2014)
                     •	 Plan Report No. 3 – Implementation Strategy (December 2014)

                  Public Review
                  In addition to technical reviews and analysis conducted by the project consultant and
                  supported by the staff of the partner jurisdictions, a series of advisory committee and
                  public reviews were conducted.

                                           Project Advisory Committee (PAC) considered and approved project goals and

                                                         COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




Trail Highlights
North-South – The preferred trail alignment for this corridor extends approximately 9
miles from the north side of the City of Banks to the northeast side of the City of Forest
Grove. The corridor is primarily rural and in active agricultural use, except for sections in
Banks. The preferred alignment passes through Banks, farmland in rural unincorporated
Washington County, the unincorporated community of Verboort, and to the edge of Forest
Grove. Outside of Banks, the multiuse trail aligns along the edges of existing county
roadways, minimizing impacts on farmlands, stream corridors and wetlands. As private
land acquisition for the north-south trail will be on a willing seller basis, an interim trail
solution relying on shared-use of these county roadways is also included as part of the
master plan.

West-East – The second trail corridor extends approximately 5.5 miles from downtown
Forest Grove to downtown Hillsboro. Sections are in Forest Grove, Cornelius, and
Hillsboro, and urban unincorporated Washington County between Cornelius and
Hillsboro. A north-south “spur” trail to the Tualatin River is also included. The corridor is
primarily urbanized, or planned for residential, commercial and industrial uses. Except
for the Tualatin River spur, the entire west-east trail will be located within an existing rail
right-of-way. A rail-with-trail solution is proposed, but final design could vary depending
on changes in the future use of the corridor for freight or commuter train or other transit
service.

Plan Implementation – Trail Cost and Phasing
Cost estimates are plan level and subject to change based on survey, design and
engineering, actual property acquisition costs, and the timing of trail development.

Banks to Forest Grove (Segments 1 and 2)                               $27,149,400
Forest Grove to Hillsboro (Segments 3, 4 and 6)                        $22,164,550
Tualatin River Spur Trail (Segment 5)                                   $2,611,500


Many factors will influence trail construction phasing and time frames. The timing and
feasibility of property acquisition and availability of construction funding are primary
drivers. Phasing will also be influenced by changing jurisdictional authority and priorities,
public and private development, and evolving regional and local plans. The preferred

1: Plan Background and Development
Project Context and Location
The Council Creek Regional Trail (CCRT) will be a multiuse pathway for pedestrians,
bicyclists, and other nonmotorized travelers for both recreational and transportation
purposes. The trail will extend almost 15 miles from the Banks-Vernonia Trail in Banks
to the TriMet Blue Line MAX station in downtown Hillsboro. The CCRT will connect
through rural, suburban, and urban areas—residential neighborhoods, farms, downtowns,
commercial, and industrial. The CCRT will cross or follow state highways Oregon 6,
Oregon 8, and Oregon 47; and follow and cross a rail line and numerous urban and rural
roadways.

The CCRT Master Plan is a partnership of the cities of Banks, Forest Grove, Cornelius,
and Hillsboro, Washington County, Metro and the Oregon Department of Transportation
(ODOT). Some or all of these jurisdictions may be responsible for the final design,
engineering and building of sections of the trail. The CCRT will pass through the four
cities, a large expanse of productive farmlands between Banks and Forest Grove, and
some smaller areas of still unincorporated land within the urban growth boundary (UGB)
between Forest Grove and Hillsboro.

Trail Planning Corridors and Segments
The CCRT study area consists of two corridors – North-South and West-East. Smaller
segments within these two corridors were identified for planning purposes. See Map 1
below. Some segment boundaries were modified as outcomes of the existing conditions
and trail alignment analysis phases of this planning process. Two segments defined
earlier in the process were combined, and some trail alignments were considered that
were outside of the segment boundaries.
                            Map 1. Trail Planning Segments




                                                                                         1
COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




                  North-South Trail Corridor
                  The preferred alternative for this corridor extends approximately 9 miles from the north
                  side of the City of Banks to the City of Forest Grove. The original corridor was bounded
                  by NW Thatcher Road and NW Kansas City Road on the west, and on the east by NW
                  Martin Road, NW Marsh Road, and NW Roy Road (3 to 4 miles wide). The corridor is
                  primarily rural and in active agricultural use, except for Banks and portions of Forest
                  Grove. The preferred trail alternative will pass through the City of Banks, rural reserves
                  south of Banks in rural unincorporated Washington County, through the unincorporated
                  community of Verboort to Oregon 47, and to the north edge of Forest Grove.

                  Planning segments within the North-South Corridor are:
                    •	 Segment 1: Banks
                    •	 Segment 2: Washington County North
                  West-East Trail Corridor
                  The second trail corridor is less than 3,000 feet wide in some places and extends for
                  approximately 5.5 miles from downtown Forest Grove to downtown Hillsboro. Council
                  Creek is generally the original corridor’s northern boundary, and Oregon 8 was generally
                  the southern boundary. Portions of this corridor are in the cities of Forest Grove,
                  Cornelius, and Hillsboro, and in urban unincorporated Washington County between
                  Cornelius and Hillsboro. A north-south “spur” trail to the Tualatin River is also included.
                  The corridor is primarily urbanized, or planned for residential, commercial and industrial
                  uses. There are some high value natural resource lands along stream corridors and two
                  remaining active commercial agricultural areas.

                  Planning segments within the West-East Corridor are:
                    •	 Segment 3: Forest Grove. This segment was originally included in the North-South
                       Corridor, but was shifted when the joint PAC/SAC decision was made to extend the
                       trail along the rail corridor into downtown Forest Grove.
                    •	 Segment 4: Cornelius. The west end of this segment includes areas of incorporated
                       Forest Grove.
                    •	 Segment 5: Jobes Ditch. North-south in orientation. Accommodates a spur trail to
                       the Tualatin River that would connect to the CCRT main stem trail at the east end of
                       Segment 4.
                    •	 Segment 6: Hillsboro – Washington County East. This segment includes urban
                       unincorporated lands that were brought within the Cornelius UGB in 2014.

                  Master Plan Reports
                  The CCRT Master Plan was developed in four phases, and each phase is reported in a
                  standalone plan report:
                    •	 Plan Report No. 1 – Existing Conditions (February 2014) – Described and mapped
                       factors that may impact trail planning and development by each planning segment,
                       as well as by existing conditions, including existing plans, design opportunities and
                       challenges, natural resources, transportation, land uses and structures, and major
                       utility corridors (see CCRT Master Plan Appendix A).

 •	 Plan Report No. 2 – Trail Alignment Analysis (July 2014) – Analyzed and mapped
    a range of trail alignment alternatives and trail types. This report documents public,
    stakeholder, and advisory committee processes and outcomes through July 2014,
    including alignment alternatives recommended for further analysis as the preferred
    alternative (see Appendix B).
 •	 Plan Report No. 3 – Implementation Strategy (December 2014) – Analyzed the
    alignments identified for additional consideration in the preceding phase, and provided
    trail design typology and conceptual cross sections, cost estimates, assessments
    of partner jurisdiction authority for trail development and operations, regulatory
    requirements, and a preliminary phasing plan (see Appendix C). This report also
    documents public, stakeholder and advisory committee processes and outcomes after
    July 2014, including preferred trail alternative recommendations made by the Project
    Advisory Committee (PAC) and Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC) meeting
    jointly in December 2014.
 •	 Master Plan – The master plan describes and maps the preferred alternatives
    recommended in December 2014, and summarizes key existing conditions
    and implementation strategies developed as part of Plan Report Nos. 1 and 3.
    Recommended trail alignments, trail types, and roadway and stream crossings shown
    in the master plan have not been subject to survey, final design, or engineering.

Goals and Objectives
The CCRT Master Plan Project Delivery and Quality Control Plan details overarching
master plan project goals, objectives and processes (Appendix D). This document states:

  The Council Creek Regional Trail (CCRT) Master Plan will recommend a
  comprehensive strategy, including trail alignment alternatives and implementation
  actions, for the development of an uninterrupted 15-mile-long regional trail corridor
  from downtown Hillsboro through the cities of Cornelius and Forest Grove and then
  north across rural unincorporated farming areas in Washington County to the City of
  Banks. Specific master planning process objectives are to:
    •	 Coordinate the inputs and actions of the various project jurisdictional partners,
       and other stakeholders.
    •	 Engage local jurisdictions, property owners, citizens, businesses, and other
       stakeholders in the CCRT’s development.
    •	 Collect and summarize baseline information on the existing conditions within the
       CCRT corridor and in immediately abutting areas.
    •	 Analyze specific trail segments within the trail corridor addressing opportunities
       and constraints with respect to roadway and railway crossings, stream and
       wetland impacts, urban and rural land uses, and other opportunities and
       limitations, to best assure trail sections and segments can be constructed to
       regional trail standards.
    •	 Develop implementation and phasing strategies.
    •	 Produce draft CCRT Master Plan documents available for jurisdictional,
       stakeholder, and public review and distribution.
    •	 Produce a final CCRT Master Plan to guide local jurisdictions in the planning,
       design, permitting, and development of the trail.


                                                                                            3

                  Advisory Committees
                  The master plan process benefited from the input and guidance of three committees.
                  Committee membership is listed on the Acknowledgments page of this master plan
                  report. Committee roles and responsibilities, and the original project meeting schedule,
                  are included as Appendix E.

                  Project Management Team (PMT)
                  The PMT met regularly over the course of the project to review project schedules,
                  processes and preliminary deliverables; and to address issues raised during project
                  outreach events such as public open houses. The PMT consisted of a staff representative
                  from the Cities of Forest Grove, Cornelius, and Hillsboro, as well as from Washington
                  County, Metro, and ODOT.

                  Project Advisory Committee (PAC)
                  The PAC consisted of PMT members, plus a staff representative from the city of Banks,
                  and one additional official each from Forest Grove, Cornelius, Washington County, and
                  Metro. The PAC met four times in the course of the master plan process.
                    •	 October 2013: Considered and approved project goals and objectives, scope of work
                       and schedule, as well as public involvement processes.
                    •	 January 2014: Considered existing conditions information.
                    •	 July 2014: Considered trail alignment alternatives and recommendations on the
                       alignments to advance to the preferred alternative phase.
                    •	 December 2014: Joint meeting with the Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC)
                       to review the outcomes of project open houses, and make recommendations for
                       preferred trail alternatives.
                  Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC)
                  SAC membership was drawn across a wide range of interests including the
                  environmental, bicycling, neighborhood, business and agricultural communities. The SAC
                  met three times in the course of the planning effort.
                    •	 April 2014: Reviewed existing conditions information and full range of possible trail
                       alternatives.
                    •	 June 2014: Reviewed first public open house outcomes and considered
                       recommendations on the trail alternatives to advance to the next stage of the planning
                       process.
                    •	 December 2014: Met jointly with PAC.

                  Stakeholder and Community Engagement
                  The project’s Public Involvement Plan (PIP) stated the following goals. The full PIP is
                  included as Appendix F.
                       •	 Ensure effective coordination and communication between jurisdictional partners
                          and stakeholders and related projects taking place within the trail study corridor.
                       •	 Engage local jurisdictions, utilities, neighborhoods, property owners, citizens,
                          bicycle and pedestrian advocates, area nonprofits, businesses, and other
                          stakeholders directly in master plan development.

    •	 Guide jurisdictional partners on future planning, design, permitting, and
       development of the trail.
    •	 Host activities and provide tools that will add value to the project and genuinely
       engage the community in an open and transparent process.
    •	 Keep the public informed with accurate, up-to-date information.
    •	 Build trust and a long-term relationship with the community.
    •	 Maintain a level of flexibility with the process.

In the course of the master plan process, the PMT determined that the timing and
number of outreach and advisory committee meetings as scheduled in the original PIP
should be moved forward to better assure early and effective stakeholder and public
input. Accordingly, SAC and PAC meetings, and an open house originally scheduled for
presentation of the draft final master plan, were moved to the trail alignment analysis and
implementation strategy phases of the project. Washington County, through the support of
county staff and approval by the county commission, provided additional funding to hold a
third public open house.

Hispanic Community Outreach
The CCRT Public Involvement Plan (see Appendix F) included a section specifically
addressing Hispanic community outreach. The cities and rural areas of western
Washington County have large Spanish speaking populations. As participation in project
open houses proved, the Hispanic community strongly supports improved bicycle
and pedestrian options. Local nonprofits Adelante Mujeres and Centro Cultural had
representatives on the project’s Stakeholder Advisory Committee. Arturo Villaseñor of
Adelante Mujeres worked with the Project Management Team to coordinate outreach
efforts.

Through the support of Metro staff and the Metro Council (Resolution No. 14-4511), in
particular Councilor Kathryn Harrington, additional funding was provided to engage the
Hispanic community in this master plan. This funding provided for:
 •	 Production of a written project overview in Spanish distributed through Adelante
    Mujeres and Centro Cultural, and the City of Forest Grove.
 •	 Translation of public notices, project materials and display posters into Spanish for
    use at project open houses and for other outreach efforts such as farmers markets.
 •	 Spanish translators provided by Adelante Mujeres and Centro Cultural at project open
    houses, and a open house resource table staffed with Spanish speakers. In addition,
    Parametrix, using the services of a native Spanish speaker on staff, recorded and
    transcribed open house notes in Spanish. The City of Hillsboro also assigned a native
    Spanish speaker on staff to the open houses.
 •	 Booths at Summer 2014 farmers markets staffed by Spanish speakers and project
    information and surveys in Spanish and English.

Public Open Houses
The first and third open houses were held at the Forest Grove Community Auditorium.
The second open house was held at the City of Cornelius Council Chambers.

                       corridor. Approximately 60 individuals attended this meeting. Public input on concerns
                       and ideas for trail development was recorded. In addition, 47 project questionnaires
                       were submitted. Open house records are included in Plan Report No. 2.
                    •	 August 27, 2014: Reviewed the set of trail alignment alternatives identified by the
                       PAC for consideration as the preferred alternatives, and solicited public comments
                       and suggestions for additional alternatives. Approximately 60 individuals attended. In
                       addition, 15 project questionnaires were submitted. Open house records are included
                       in Plan Report No. 3.
                    •	 November 5, 2014: Reviewed preliminary preferred trail alternatives and costs,
                       development phasing, and implementation actions. Approximately 50 individuals
                       attended. In addition, 15 project questionnaires were submitted. Open house records
                       are included in Plan Report No. 3.




                  Stakeholder Interviews
                  Supplementing the community open houses, members of the project team met
                  formally and informally with individual stakeholders throughout the planning process.
                  Twelve formal interviews were conducted. Records of these interviews are included
                  as appendices in Plan Report Nos. 2 and 3. Metro hosted a project website providing
                  opportunities for interested parties to review all draft and final plan reports, and this
                  master plan report.

2: Existing Conditions
Existing conditions within the CCRT study area present a wide range of opportunities and
challenges for trail development. These include existing and planned land uses, property
ownership and control, natural resources and other physical features, and transportation.
For a complete review see Plan Report No. 1 – Existing Conditions (Appendix A).
Additional existing conditions information and impacts, particularly with respect to
applicable jurisdictional guidelines and regulations, are summarized in Plan Report No. 3.

Key conditions and features that may impact the preferred north-south and west-east trail
corridors and preferred trail alignments and types include:

                  Existing Plans
                  A variety of regional and local government plans and policies will impact CCRT
                  development. These include plans related to conventional transportation, active
                  transportation (including trails), parks and open space, and land use.

                  The most significant finding regarding the 22 regional and local plans reviewed at the
                  outset of this project is that with one exception (see Local Plans on the next page) all
                  either support the CCRT directly or support trails and active transportation alternatives to
                  motorized travel. Nine other statewide or local guidance and regulatory policy documents
                  were reviewed later in the process. Results are documented in Plan Report No. 3, and
                  are summarized in Chapter 5 of this master plan.

                  Regional Plans
                  Metro is responsible for regional planning on behalf of Washington County and three of
                  the four local government jurisdictions participating in the CCRT planning effort (Banks
                  is not within Metro). Three Metro planning documents support pedestrian and bicycle
                  systems and regional trail development.

 •	 Regional Trails and Greenways Plan (2014)
Local Plans
Washington County and the four partner cities have adopted numerous long-range plans
addressing land use, trails and bicycle/pedestrian systems, parks and open space, and
transportation. All plans reviewed, except for the Forest Grove Rail Concept Study (which
nonetheless indirectly supports alternative transportation options), supported pedestrian
and bicycle systems and trails and, in many cases, specifically identified the CCRT. See
Plan Report No. 1 (Appendix A) for complete information.

Natural Resources
Vegetative Cover
Farming and forestry practices, and gradual urbanization in the CCRT study area have
greatly altered woodland, valley, and stream corridor vegetation from historic patterns.
Because of these losses, remaining native vegetation will present few constraints to
trail development, except where associated with wetlands and riparian woodlands.
Opportunities for wetland and riparian enhancement and prairie grassland restoration may
arise as part of trail development.

There are four major habitats crossed or along the preferred trail alignments:

Farmlands
There are extensive and productive farmlands between Banks and Forest Grove
(Segments 1 and 2). Segments 5 and 6 between Cornelius and Hillsboro also have
remaining areas of farmland.

Farmlands in the valley floor were once prairie grassland habitat with oak savannah
and other tree species. Although agricultural practices have greatly altered historic
ecosystems, many grassland species, such as pollinators, insects, small mammals, and
birds, are still present.

Urbanized Lands
Significant portions of Segments 1, 3, 4, and 6 are highly urbanized. Development has
greatly reduced intact contiguous areas of native vegetation, and landscaping practices
have introduced many nonnative plant species.

Valley Woodlands
Nonriparian woodland remnants include small woodlots surrounded by agricultural lands,
and wooded residential areas. Many woodland wildlife and bird species will forage into
farmlands and nearby suburban areas.

Wetlands and Riparian Woodlands
Wetlands and riparian areas crossed by the preferred trail alignments are along West
Fork Dairy Creek (Segment 2), the main channel of Council Creek (Segment 3), and Dairy
Creek near the confluence with McKay Creek (Segment 6). There are also numerous
minor stream and drainage corridors, but many of these have been highly altered by
channelization, draining, and/or the removal of riparian vegetation.


                                                                                          9
COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




                  Wetlands and riparian habitats support pollinators and insects, smaller and larger
                  mammals, and a variety of water-dependent reptiles and amphibians. Bird species that
                  favor wetter environments are also common. Bridges and boardwalks, and careful trail
                  siting along habitat edges or through previously disturbed areas, are recommended to avoid
                  impacts. Trail development should be an opportunity to restore and improve these habitats.

                  Streams and Water Bodies
                  Streams crossed by the preferred trail alignments include the West Fork of Dairy Creek
                  (Segment 2), Council Creek (Segment 3), and Dairy Creek near the confluence with
                  McKay Creek (Segment 6).

                  Trail crossings of streams should be avoided if at all possible, and bridges and
                  boardwalks, rather than culverts, should be used if a crossing is necessary. The design of
                  crossing structures should take into careful consideration the preservation of stream and
                  riparian habitat and passage for fish and wildlife. Bridges and boardwalks, and careful
                  trail siting along habitat edges or through previously disturbed areas are recommended to
                  avoid impacts. Trail development should be an opportunity to restore and improve these
                  habitats.

                  Floodplains
                  East of Oregon 47, the West Fork Dairy Creek floodplain begins to narrow from the broad
                  floodplain west of the highway (Segment 2). The Council Creek floodplain in Segment 3
                  is considerably more proscribed than that of West Fork Dairy Creek. Within Segment 6,
                  the 100-year floodplain created by the confluence of Council, Dairy, and McKay Creeks
                  significantly broadens.

                  Trails across floodplains should be avoided if possible, but trail alignments and treatments
                  can be more flexible and adaptive than in wetland or riparian areas. Siting of trails outside
                  of 10-year and 50-year floodplains and along edges of the 100-year floodplain will reduce
                  the possibility of inundation. Trail structures in floodplain areas should be constructed to
                  withstand intermittent flooding, and elevated structures such as boardwalks should be
                  considered to avoid impeding floodwaters.

                  Fish and Wildlife
                  Although there are some federal Endangered Species Act (ESA)- and state-listed fish
                  and wildlife species present within the CCRT study area, preferred trail alignments avoid
                  most areas of high fish and wildlife value—stream corridors and associated riparian
                  zones and wetlands. High value areas impacted by the preferred alignments are limited to
                  improving two existing crossings of West Fork Dairy Creek (Segment 2) along NW Evers
                  Road, improving or replacing the existing NW Porter Road bridge across Council Creek
                  (Segment 3), and reuse or replacement of an existing railroad bridge across Dairy Creek
                  (Segment 6).

                  Roadways and rail lines, and the lack of suitable connecting habitat due to urbanization
                  and farming, are the primary barriers to wildlife movements across and along the
                  preferred trail alignments. Higher traffic volume and wider streets in particular pose
                  difficulties to wildlife passage, as can active rail lines. Future trail builders should consult
                  Metro’s Westside Trail Master Plan (2014) Chapter 6, Wildlife Corridors, for principles of
                  habitat restoration and conservation and wildlife friendly passage treatments developed
                  within the context of the Tualatin Valley.

Environmental Overlay Zones/Mitigation Areas
Some CCRT municipal partners have established land use regulations defining
environmental or natural resource overlay zones. Only the City of Hillsboro’s overlay
around Dairy Creek (Segment 6) may be impacted by a preferred trail alignment, but
the location of this section of trail within an established rail corridor will greatly limit or
eliminate potential conflicts. No designated environmental mitigation sites are crossed by
a preferred trail alignment.

Steep and Unstable Slopes
The preferred trail alignments are mostly along flat valley bottomland. Topography should
not be a significant challenge to trail siting. The West Fork Dairy Creek (Segment 2),
Council Creek (Segment 3), and Dairy Creek (Segment 6) have steeper slopes along
stream banks. Slope impacts will be mitigated by using boardwalks and bridges for trail
crossings.

The Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI) documents
unstable slope conditions. According to the DOGAMI records, there are no unstable
slopes along the preferred alignments.

Hazardous Materials
The preferred trail alignments do not cross or abut any hazardous materials sites
documented by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).

Soils and Geology
Except for soils associated with streams and wetlands, none of the soils along the
preferred trail alignments pose significant constraints to trail development.

Transportation
Rail
The rail line extending from near the Pacific University campus in Forest Grove to the
vicinity of the MAX station in downtown Hillsboro presently supports limited freight rail
service. This line is a possibility for a future MAX light rail extension or some other form of
high capacity transit.

This rail line corridor is the preferred west-east CCRT alignment.

Roadways
The preferred CCRT alignment will require several new arterial and collector roadway
intersection or midblock crossing improvements. See Chapter 4.

Regional Trails and Bikeways
The CCRT preferred trail alignments will connect to, cross, or parallel the following
existing or planned regional trails, bikeways, and greenways.




                                                                                             11

                  Transit
                  TriMet provides transit and bus services within Segments 3, 4, and 6. The eastern
                  terminus of the CCRT will be in downtown Hillsboro in the vicinity of the MAX Blue Line
                  light rail station near N First Avenue (Segment 6). A possible extension of light rail or high
                  capacity transit from Hillsboro to downtown Forest Grove could use the freight rail line
                  that crosses Segments 3, 4, and 6.

                  Land Uses and Structures
                  The preferred CCRT trail alignments will connect to major destinations or activity
                  generators such as schools, outdoor recreation areas, and civic and commercial centers.
                  Existing land uses and structures can also significantly reduce the options for trail siting. A
                  range of land uses and structures are documented in Plan Report Nos. 1 and 2.

                  Lands between Segment 1 and Segment 3 in unincorporated Washington County are
                  primarily designated Rural Reserves under Metro authority and zoned Exclusive Farm
                  Use under County code. Specific land use standards in the County’s Rural/Natural
                  Resources Plan and Community Development Code may apply to trail development.

                  Historic and Archaeological Resources
                  Oregon State Parks and Recreation (OPRD) manages a historic and archaeological
                  preservation inventory program which identified the following resources near the
                  preferred trail alignment.

                                   Table 4. Historic Resources
Segment 1              Fifteen historic sites or within the city limits of Banks.
                       There are over a dozen historic sites and buildings in Segment 2 in or
Segment 2
                       near to the community of Verboort.
                       Only one designated historic or archaeological resource (Hillsboro
                       Pioneer Cemetery), although the rail line itself is historically significant
Segments 3, 4, and 6
                       given its original function as an early 20th Century electric rail
                       commuter service connecting Forest Grove to Portland.

Conflicts between documented historic resources and the preferred CCRT alignments
should not be a factor. Historic sites and buildings are destinations for pedestrians and
bicyclists, particularly where there are larger concentrations of such sites, as is the case
around the community of Verboort (Segment 2).

Utility Corridors
Electrical Transmission Corridors
Electrical transmission structures can challenge trail routing. Pole or tower relocation
can be very expensive (up to approximately $100,000 per pole set, plus permitting). With
transmission-level infrastructure, relocations often involve multiple poles or towers. Utility
requirements for maintenance access and vegetation management around and under
power transmission infrastructure (wires, poles and towers) can also limit trail options.
See Plan Report No. 3 (Appendix C) for more details.

Bonneville Power Administration (BPA): A BPA transmission-scale power line system
enters and crosses the larger CCRT study area, but has no direct impact on preferred trail
alignments. A BPA power substation near Oak Street (Segment 3) is near the intersection
of the north-south and west-east preferred trail alignments, and power lines may pass
over short sections of the trail in this location.

Portland General Electric (PGE): A PGE transmission line follows the east edge
of Oregon 47 from Banks to NW Kemper Road through Segments 1 and 2. This
transmission line then follows local roadways through the community of Verboort. The
location of PGE transmission poles may constrain opportunities to site the preferred
street-adjacent multiuse trail in these areas.

A PGE transmission line also follows the north side of the preferred CCRT rail corridor
alignment through Segments 4 and 6. The location of these power poles may challenge
trail-with-rail solutions.

Agricultural Irrigation
Tualatin Valley Irrigation District (TVID): Routes over or along major agriculture
irrigation lines operated by TVID are possibilities for street-adjacent multiuse trail siting
along the preferred alignment in Segment 2. These TVID lines parallel nearly the entire
preferred alignment though these segments, except for the trail section along Oregon 47
south of Banks.

Trail use is limited by TVID and Bureau of Reclamation policy and would require special
agreements with these agencies and with the underlying private property owners. PGE

                                                                                                      13
COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




                  transmission lines on the opposite side from TVID lines along NW Visitation Road and a
                  portion off NW Osterman Road further complicates CCRT siting.

                  Sewer and Water
                  No preferred trail alignments conflict with major sanitary sewer and drinking water lines or
                  structures.

                  Natural Gas and Petroleum Pipelines
                  No preferred trail alignments conflict with major natural gas or petroleum pipelines.

3: Preferred Trail Alignments
Overview
Plan Report No. 1 – Existing Conditions (Appendix A) provides the essential background
and context to the technical analysis reported in Plan Report No. 2 – Trail Alignment
Analysis (Appendix B). This analysis established the set of trail alternatives advanced
to consideration as preferred alternatives. Plan Report No. 3 – Implementation Strategy
(Appendix C) documents the considerations and processes that resulted in preferred
alternative recommendations by the SAC and PAC.

All illustrated trail alignment alternatives and trail types are conceptual and plan-level and
have not been subject to survey, final design, or engineering.

Master Plan Evolution
CCRT alignments and trail types evolved significantly as an outcome of technical
analysis, public input, and advisory committee review. Comparative trail alternative
criteria were developed and approved by the PAC. These criteria were applied to
the range of alternatives published as part of Plan Report No. 3 (see Chapter 8).The
selection of preferred alternatives in December 2014 also reflected stakeholder and
public input, including identification of an interim shared-use on-street solution through
the North-South Corridor (Segments 1 and 2).

Key changes and decisions with respect to trail alignments and types over the course of
the project are summarized in Table 5 below, and illustrated on the three maps that follow
(Maps 2, 3, and 4) showing the alternatives under consideration in April, July and October
2014. Capitalized names below (WEST, RAIL, CREEK, etc.) are those applied to various
alignment alternatives. See Plan Report Nos. 2 and 3 for details and complete mapping.
Map 5 shows the preferred alternatives selected by the SAC and PAC in December 2014.
The preferred alternatives are described and mapped in more detail in the balance of
Chapter 3 of this master plan report.
       Table 5. Changes to Trail Alignments and Types (April 2014 to November 2014)
Segment 1: Banks
       Original WEST option dropped to avoid extended crossings of farmland and a new crossing of OR 6.
       Original CENTER option dropped at request of City to avoid undue impacts on Main St (OR 47)
       through downtown Banks. In late 2015, new City trail system plan may recommend use of Main St.
       Added new combined WEST/CENTER option that used planned City collector road alignment and
       existing OR 6 undercrossing.

Segment 2: Washington County North
       WEST and EAST connector routes to OR 47 shifted from local roads to collector (NW Greenville Rd)
       to align with Tualatin Valley Scenic Bikeway, and to eliminate farmland crossings.
       All trail alignments involving crossings of farmland dropped, except for BPA corridor (WEST).

       Only trail alignments along street edge of farmlands used, except BPA WEST.

       Use of NW Thatcher Rd (WEST) dropped – too many farm impacts.



                                                                                                        15
COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




                         On-street solution used through Verboort community rather than separate trails, including for last
                         500 feet on NW Visitation Rd before NW Heesacker Rd.
                         Shared-use on-street option retained as interim alternative for all of EAST 1, except OR 47
                         approaching Banks.
                         On-street option retained as interim alternative for all of EAST 1.
                         On-street option recommended as permanent solution for first 500 feet at north end of NW Porter
                         Rd to avoid impacts on farm improvements.

                   Segment 3: Forest Grove
                         West-East trail route along rail corridor extended into downtown Forest Grove.

                   Segment 4: Cornelius
                         Use of future N Holladay St roadway extension between OR 47 and N 10th Ave identified as
                         possible route alternative to the along-the-creek CREEK option.
                         CREEK between N 10th Ave and N 19th Ave realigned to use street ROW and willing seller property
                         only.
                         All trail alignment options north of Council Creek between N 19th Ave and NW Hobbs Rd dropped.
                         Use of north side of RAIL 1 further analyzed with ODOT, TriMet, and PGE input (south side remains
                         the more technically feasible and cost effective option).
                         RAIL 2 option added at suggestion of urban unincorporated property owners (subsequently dropped
                         based on Union Pacific Rail policy).

                   Segment 5: Jobes Ditch
                         Option along NW 334th Ave impacting rural reserve farm properties dropped, recommended option
                         (N 29th Ave extension) exclusively in UGB.

                   Segment 6: Hillsboro/Washington County East
                         CREEK modified to use on-street option rather than separate trail along portion of golf course.
                         Use of north side of RAIL 1 further analyzed with ODOT, TriMet, and PGE input (south side remains
                         the more technically feasible and cost-effective option).
                         New connector option between CREEK and RAIL 1 added to allow combination of two options.
                         RAIL 2 option added at suggestion of urban unincorporated property owners (subsequently dropped
                         based on UPRR policy).

Preferred Trail Alternatives
Overall and north-south and west-east corridor maps follow illustrating the preferred
alignments and trail type alternatives as recommended by the PAC and SAC in December
2014. The preferred alternatives for each trail planning segment are also mapped and key
information listed (jurisdiction, trail types, trail design, trail length, estimated costs, and
phasing). Conceptual trail type cross sections in each segment are also illustrated. Details
of the interim on-street solution shown on Map 5 below can be found in Chapter 6.

4: Trail Types and Treatments
Overview
Lengthy multijurisdictional trails such as Council Creek must reflect changing
opportunities and constraints along the trail route. City and county transportation, bicycle/
pedestrian, and parks and open space plans may define local standards. Trail width and
treatments, surface materials, and structures may need to vary to accommodate trail
use types and volumes, neighboring development, vegetation, streams, topography, and
roadway patterns.

Trail design standards should incorporate such local standards and conditions. Standards
should also apply reasonably consistent design and treatments that provide a common
template creating economies in both construction and maintenance, and a uniform sense
of place for trail users. Chapter 4 provides the following information:
 •	 Trail Types and Treatments: Baseline standards for designing and building different
    trail types that are compatible with the varying landscapes along the trail corridor.
    Conceptual trail cross-sections and some plan views are provided.
 •	 Trail Crossings: Conceptual guidelines and cross sections for crossings at major
    road intersections, midblock, and grade-separated.

Preferred Trail Types
The CCRT preferred trail type is a multiuse trail accommodating the full range of users—
touring, commuter, family, and recreational bicyclists; users of other conveyances such
as strollers, skates, etc.; and family, touring, and casual pedestrians seeking exercise
and recreation or alternative means to schools, shopping, and services. Two multiuse trail
variations are primarily recommended for of the CCRT—street-adjacent multiuse and rail-
with-trail. The common features are:
 •	 Surface width of 10 to 12 feet, with 2-foot-wide graveled shoulders (10-foot width is
    practical for lower volume rural trail sections)
 •	 Asphalt or other hard surface (concrete does not require graveled shoulders – can be
    used to narrow trail sections in constrained areas)
 •	 ADA-compliant grades (less than 5 percent longitudinal slope and 2 percent cross-slope)
Street-Adjacent Multiuse
Alignments that closely parallel roadways distinguish street-adjacent multiuse trails from the
standard multiuse trail (see page 57 for standard multiuse cross section). The street-adjacent
trail is separated from the roadway by a landscaped buffer or drainage swale between edge
of road and trail.

Rural Street-Adjacent Multiuse
For roadways where stormwater conveyance and treatment is handled by open drainage
swales, typically in rural areas. Swales act as the trail buffer. The rural street-adjacent
multiuse type is the primary solution for the North-South Corridor. The greatest challenge for
this trail type will be conflicts with other infrastructure—TVID irrigation lines or PGE power
transmission poles—that also closely follow existing roadways. Relocation of these lines or
the purchase of additional right of way may be necessary.

                  Rail-with-Trail
                  A rail corridor (RAIL 1) from downtown Forest Grove through downtown Cornelius to
                  downtown Hillsboro is the preferred CCRT alignment through Segments 3, 4 and 6. This
                  rail corridor is owned by the State of Oregon and leased to a private freight rail operator.
                  The rail corridor is primarily 60 feet wide and occupied by single-track freight line with
                  very limited low speed traffic. The freight rail track is approximately 5 feet off-center of
                  the corridor towards the north side. Specific trail solutions are complicated by continued
                  freight rail use, plans for a future TriMet MAX line or high capacity transit extension, and a
                  PGE transmission-scale power line along the north edge of the rail corridor from Oregon
                  47 to Hillsboro.

                  Given current and future uses, four rail-with-trail variations are illustrated. All variations
                  assume a multiuse trail sited along the south side of the rail corridor. North side trail
                  alignments may require expensive power pole relocations, particularly through Segment
                  4. Final trail design and engineering may find room to switch sides for portions of the trail,
                  or offer siting or design solutions providing five or more extra feet of separation between
                  the south edge of the rail corridor right of way and the planned trail.

                  Any decision to extend MAX to downtown Forest Grove will be preceded by abandonment
                  of the rail line for freight services, and a range of planning and transportation corridor
                  studies. See page 57 for an illustration of one concept to re-use the rail corridor without
                  freight or MAX lines. High capacity transit with a multiuse trail is another option for the
                  future of the corridor.

Single-Track Freight Rail
Assumes that freight rail is still operating at time of trail development. The cross section
below illustrates the minimum trail separation from low speed, low traffic freight lines
suggested by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) guidance. The multiuse trail can
be further modified to fit within the 60-foot rail corridor by eliminating one shoulder or
reducing trail width to 10 feet.

Single-Track MAX (with Station Stops)
TriMet requires less separation from MAX tracks than FHWA guidance. Since MAX tracks
would be new, the rail alignment could also be shifted within the corridor. This trail/single-
track MAX combination, including minimum width (12 feet) station stop side platforms,
would leave approximately 16 feet of the rail corridor for additional separation between
the trail and track, for intermittent passing tracks, or for amenities such as landscaping.
PGE power poles would not have to be relocated.

                  Dual-Track MAX (with and without Station Stops)
                  TriMet standards allow dual-track MAX systems without station stops within a 32-foot-
                  wide section. This dual-track configuration, when combined with a 16-foot-wide trail
                  section, leaves 12 feet for additional separation between the tracks and the trail. It also
                  avoids power pole relocation.

                  The trail siting challenge with the dual-track is that station stops will be intermittently
                  required. The minimum width for a station stop center platform sited between tracks is 15
                  feet, for a total 47-foot-wide MAX section. This leaves the rail corridor 3 feet too narrow to
                  accommodate a 16-foot trail section. Additional right of way may be difficult to acquire due
                  to surrounding development. The multiuse trail section could be narrowed or use concrete
                  surfaces to eliminate gravel shoulders. Station stop design could also narrow the platform
                  width. PGE power poles in the vicinity of station stops may have to be relocated.

Other Trail Types
A variety of opportunities and constraints suggest or require other trail types to establish a
continuous and fully functional regional-scale trail accommodating all users.

Rail-to-Trail
If freight rail vacates the West-East Corridor, and the MAX extension does not occur, a
multiuse trail combined with greenway and recreational improvements is possible. One
possible scenario is illustrated below. High capacity bus transit with a multiuse trail is
another option.

 Note: Wide range of trail combinations possible with rail right-of-way if no future freight or passenger rail service is planned.


Standard Multiuse
The standard multiuse trail follows an off-road alignment, completely separate from and
on a different route from roadways. The standard multiuse trail type is applied to the
Segment 5: Jobes Ditch/HOBBS trail section south of S Dogwood Lane.

                  Elevated multiuse boardwalk structures set on piers across wetlands, floodplain areas,
                  or other sensitive lands can reduce or eliminate many environmental impacts. Multiuse

                  Shared-Use Roadway
                  Shared-use roadways allow all trail users to use vehicular roadways, with signing and
                  road surface markings to assure safety. This solution is only practical and safe on low-
                  speed, low-traffic roadways. See page 78 for an interim shared-use trail alignment
                  solution for the North-South Corridor (EAST 1).

                  The EAST 1 preferred alternative proposes a permanent shared-use solution through
                  Verboort. This includes sections of NW Visitation Road, NW Heesacker Road, and NW
                  Porter Road; a widened shoulder on NW Visitation Road; and a widened sidewalk on the
                  north side of NW Verboort Road.

Bicycle Lane–Sidewalk
Conventional bicycle lanes, designated by road surface striping/signing, with parallel
pedestrian sidewalks, are recommended for two CCRT sections:
 •	 Along N 29th Avenue to the Jobes Ditch/HOBBS multiuse trail (Segment 5).
 •	 Along NW Washington Street between NW Dennis Avenue and the downtown
    Hillsboro MAX station (Segment 6). Most of this section is already developed with
    sidewalks and bicycle lanes.

In addition, the City of Banks is expected to adopt a new bicycle/pedestrian and trail
system plan by the end of 2015. Early in the CCRT process the City requested that Main
Street (Segment 1) not be part of the CCRT route. The City’s new plan may reverse this
recommendation.

Crossing Structures
Multiuse Bridges
Up to three new bridges crossing streams will be required (Segments 2, 3 and 6). Bridge
lengths are approximate but conceptually sized to limit any in-water work. The final
design and construction method for bridges will be subject to the specifics of each site.
                                               Table 7. Multiuse Bridges
Segment 2           West Fork Dairy Creek – NW Evers Rd                          90-foot span

Segment 6           Dairy Creek – south of confluence with McKay Creek           390-foot span

The new Dairy Creek trail bridge in Segment 6 would parallel the existing railway bridge.
If freight rail is abandoned, the existing bridge could be adapted for trail use.

                  Other Stream Crossings
                  Minor stream crossings may require modifying existing conveyance structures (such
                  as by lengthening culverts), installation of short new culverts, or signing and pavement
                  markings over existing bridge structures. Culverts may require permitting from Clean
                  Water Services (CWS) or other local agencies, and from federal agencies for fish bearing
                  streams. See Chapter 9 of Plan Report No. 3 for more information.

                  Roadway Crossings
                  The CCRT will cross a variety of urban and rural local, collector, and arterial roadways
                  at existing intersections and at midblock. Collector and arterial midblock and intersection
                  crossing points are shown on segment maps. CCRT roadway crossings are all at-grade,
                  with the exception of the recommended undercrossing of Oregon 6 south of Banks
                  (Segment 1). The final determination of intersection and midblock crossing treatments
                  should be based on local jurisdiction or Washington County standards. Local street
                  midblock and intersection street crossings use conventional crosswalk signing and
                  striping.

                  Crossings in italics are at the same point as a rail crossing. To the extent freight rail
                  or light rail is operating at the time of trail development, improvements to rail crossing
                  infrastructure and surfaces may also be required.

Arterial and Collector Intersections
Trail crossings at established collector and arterial intersections will use traffic stop
signals or signing, crosswalk signing and striping, and other traffic controls. Upgrades
may be required on a case-by-case basis in accordance with municipal or ODOT
standards.

Arterial and Collector Midblock
Arterial roadway crossings use crosswalk signing and striping and pedestrian-activated
full stop signals. A raised center refuge island is highly preferable. Collector roadway
crossings use crosswalk signing and striping and pedestrian-activated flashing beacons.
A raised center refuge island is preferable.

Highway Undercrossing
An undercrossing of Oregon 6 is recommended south of downtown Banks (Segment 1).
The trail will follow the west side of Main Street (Oregon 47) south out of the city, cross
under Oregon 6, and continue south into Segment 2. This solution requires a 14- to 16-
foot widening of the existing undercrossing. The undercrossing retaining slope would be
cut back and replaced with an approximate 50-foot-long retaining wall. Slope cuts and
varying height retaining walls would be required for the trail’s north (350 linear feet) and
south (400 linear feet) approaches to the undercrossing. Although street-adjacent, the
approach trails would not include the standard 4- to 5-foot buffer. Trail paving should be
concrete through the undercrossing and may be asphalt for the approaches.

                  Rail Crossings
                  Although the west-east trail alignment will follow a rail line for its entire distance, the trail
                  will only cross rail lines in two places. ODOT Rail will have to be consulted for all rail
                  crossings and issue applicable crossing orders and permits.
                    •	 Segment 3: EAST 1 will have to cross to the south side of the rail line at either Oak
                       Street or Oregon 47 (Quince Street) to connect to the west-east trail alignment on the
                       south side of the rail right of way.
                    •	 Segment 5: Jobes Ditch/HOBBS will require permitting and construction of a new
                       rail crossing as part of the future NW Hobbs Road/N 29th Avenue extension. This rail
                       crossing treatment and cost will be determined as part of the larger road project.

                  Other Trail Structures
                  Trailheads
                  Trailhead facilities can include vehicle parking, secure bicycle parking, wayfinding and
                  interpretive signing, restrooms, shelters, and picnic areas. Site design and amenities may
                  vary greatly based on location and expected usage. Trailheads that share parking and
                  other facilities at government centers, schools, and commercial areas are an economical
                  alternative to standalone sites.

                  In areas along the CCRT without nearby trailhead facilities or available commercial
                  center or institutional facility parking, appropriate “no parking” and other traffic control
                  signing should be installed. In particular, trail crossings of residential and agricultural area
                  roadways, or where other trails intersect, should be signed.

                  Trailhead locations shown on segment maps are intended to identify the general areas
                  within which a trailhead facility would be desirable, and are not property-specific.
                  Conceptual trailhead locations are listed in Table 9. A lump-sum land acquisition estimate
                  is included in estimated overall trailhead costs. Trailhead sites with probable private
                  property acquisition requirements are in italics in Table 9.

5: Implementation
Cost Estimates
Tables 10 and 11 summarize construction and design/engineering costs, and order of
magnitude land acquisition costs, for each trail alignment alternative in each trail planning
segment. Cost assumptions and more detailed cost breakdowns are included in Plan
Report No. 3 (see Appendix C). Plan Report No. 3 cost information includes all the trail
alternatives being considered as of November 2014. The cost estimates below represent
refinements based on PAC/SAC recommendations in December 2014.

                  Trail Partners
                  The CCRT is within the jurisdiction of the cities of Banks, Forest Grove, Cornelius, and
                  Hillsboro, and Washington County. Metro is the regional planning authority (except for
                  Banks). ODOT manages three state highways crossed by the preferred trail alignment
                  (Segments 2, 3, and 5). These are the formal jurisdictional partners for planning and
                  developing the CCRT.

                  Acquisition Partners
                  Other governmental authorities such as stormwater and irrigation utility districts, and
                  private entities such as power utilities and railroads, may have to be partnered with on a
                  case-by-case basis. Trail right of way or easements may have to be acquired from private
                  property owners. Right of way acquisition will be conducted on a willing seller basis only,
                  not through powers of eminent domain.

                  TriMet may be a partner if the MAX line or high capacity transit is extended down RAIL 1.
                  MAX design standards combined with a multiuse trail may require a widened rail right of
                  way. TriMet does acquire private property through eminent domain.

                  Development and Operating Authority
                  Parks authority is traditionally considered a prerequisite for local governments to
                  participate in trail funding, construction, and maintenance. Increasingly, fully functional
                  transportation systems are defined to include trails. As such, jurisdictions without full
                  service parks programs may consider a road authority to be sufficient basis to undertake
                  building and operating trails. The cities of Banks, Forest Grove, Cornelius, and Hillsboro
                  all exercise full parks authority. Both ODOT and the Oregon Parks and Recreation
                  Department build and operate trails. Washington County authority is more limited (see
                  discussion below).

                  Portions of all six CCRT planning segments are currently within the jurisdiction of
                  Washington County. The County is not a parks or trail provider. Washington County
                  may partner with neighboring jurisdictions or other parks providers to build and maintain
                  trails in these segments. The County does, however, build and operate bicycle and
                  pedestrian facilities within road right of way. The street-adjacent trails proposed for use
                  in rural sections of the CCRT (primarily Segment 2) may in part be within existing right
                  of way. Any additional property needed would have to be in the form of road right of way
                  contiguous to an existing right of way to qualify for consideration for construction and
                  maintenance under the County’s road authority.

Trail Standards
Jurisdictional and other partner policies, plans, and standards may have a direct bearing
on CCRT implementation. Plans and policies for transportation systems, parks and open
space, and natural resource and surface water protection may include standards that
define or influence trail development.

Key standards are highlighted below. All policies, plans, and standards are subject to
periodic updates and revisions. Current versions or new policies should be reviewed and
used at the time of trail design and engineering. Additional information can be found in
Plan Report No. 1 – Existing Conditions and Plan Report No. 3 – Implementation Strategy.

Oregon Department of Transportation
ODOT has jurisdiction over three state highways crossed or followed by the preferred trail
alignments: Oregon 6 (Segment 1), Oregon 47 (Segments 1, 2, and 3), and Oregon 8
(Segment 5). ODOT Rail owns the rail right of way used for the preferred West-East (RAIL
1) CCRT alignment.

Oregon Bicycle and Pedestrian Design Guide
ODOT has adopted the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) guidelines for path design standards. The ODOT Bicycle and Pedestrian
Design Guide1 includes chapters for on-road bikeways, walkways, street crossings, and

                  intersections, as well as “shared-use paths.” Shared-use paths (termed multiuse trails
                  in this master plan) are those used by pedestrians, joggers, skaters, and bicyclists. The
                  Guide notes that trail design must consider the varying needs of different users, and
                  that “there are circumstances where economics or physical constraints make it difficult
                  to meet standards. A reasonable approach must be taken, so extraordinary sums are
                  not spent on a short section of path; nor would the natural landscape be excessively
                  disturbed.”

                  Table 14 summarizes key ODOT standards. Concrete surfaces are recommended by
                  ODOT for heavily used trails to maximize the longevity of the surface, although asphalt
                  surfaces are acceptable for most paths. The CCRT Master Plan primarily recommends
                  asphalt surfaces.

Bicycle Facility Design Toolkit (2012)
This toolkit provides guidance in selecting bicycle facility options as well as design
summaries, cross sections, and photographs of different options and treatments. Many of
the options are similar to those described in the CCRT Master Plan.

Pedestrian Midblock Crossing Policy
The recommended CCRT standard for midblock roadway crossings is the Washington
County Pedestrian Midblock Crossing Policy. These standards are also recommended for
crossing designs for non-County roads.

Green Trails: Guidelines for Environmentally Friendly Trails
Green Trails suggests that natural resource opportunities and challenges should be
identified early in trail planning and development processes so trails are designed
to preserve sensitive natural resources. Green Trails provides “recommendations to
complement existing standards and guidelines adopted by local cities, counties, park
providers and watershed groups in the region.” The focus is on “trails in environmentally
sensitive areas and recommends strategies for avoiding or limiting the impacts on
wildlife, water quality and water quantity.”

The Green Trails chapter on types, dimensions and materials suggests that “trail surface
materials reflect the kind and intensity of use expected and the environmental sensitivity
of the site.” Tables 16 and 17 illustrate how to select trail widths and surface materials
based on level and type of use.




                                                                                                          67

                  Other Metro Guidance
                  Metro has published two other documents that could be used for reference in designing
                  and engineering environmentally friendly trails:
                       •	 Wildlife Crossings: Providing Safe Passage for Urban Wildlife (2009).
                       •	 Westside Trail Master Plan, Chapter 6: Wildlife Corridor (2014). Although this
                          trail master plan concentrates on prairie grassland habitat within a wide power
                          transmission corridor, it contains useful guidelines, practices, and techniques for
                          restoring and conserving other habitats, as well as for wildlife-friendly trail crossing
                          and structure treatments.
                  Other Jurisdictions
                  Other government agencies and nonprofit organizations build and maintain regional trails.
                  For instance, Oregon Parks and Recreation operates the Banks-Vernonia Trail at the
                  north end of the CCRT. Governmental agencies and public and private utilities may also
                  indirectly control trail development and operations through regulation or directly through
                  trail corridor ownership. For more information, see Chapter 9 of Plan Report No. 3.

                  Trail Features and Amenities
                  Structural and amenity features include bridges, boardwalks, signage, lighting and trail
                  furniture. These features support an overall design framework that communicates a
                  unified sense of place, appearance, and experience. CCRT Master Plan Chapter 4 and
                  ODOT, Metro, and applicable Intertwine2 guidelines should be used to support overall
                  consistency in design and construction. At the time of actual engineering of particular trail
                  sections, current standards and updated trail use information should be reviewed, and
                  appropriate changes to recommended CCRT trail types and design made.

Americans with Disabilities Act Compliance
CCRT preferred alignments are within the flat valley floor of the Tualatin River Watershed.
Longitudinal slopes are primarily under 5 percent and cross slopes under 2 percent.
These existing grades allow full compliance with ADA standards without extensive use of
special structures or trail meanders and switchbacks.

The limited exceptions are where the trail crosses the West Fork Dairy Creek (Segment
2), Council Creek (Segment 3), and the main stem of Dairy Creek (Segment 6). Stream
banks may exceed longitudinal and cross slope maximums. These can be readily
mitigated using boardwalk and bridges.

Signage
Guidance on various forms of signing are available from several sources including
guidance specific to the Portland metropolitan region. Strong Hispanic community
participation in CCRT Master Plan public review processes indicates that native
Spanish speakers will be significant trail users. Appropriate wayfinding, educational, and
interpretive signage should be bilingual.
 •	 FHWA’s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the Oregon supplement
    provide guidance on regulatory and warning signs. This type of signage needs to be
    closely coordinated with city, county, and ODOT standards.
 •	 The Intertwine’s Regional Trails Signage Guidelines should be used to support a
    consistent look and feel for wayfinding, educational, and interpretive signage.

Environmental Regulations
The CCRT preferred alignments cross or pass near to streams, wetlands, floodplains,
and associated riparian areas. Regulatory compliance requirements will have to be
considered, impacts from trail construction mitigated, and restoration or enhancement
may have to be undertaken. Engineering, permitting, and construction requirements may
vary based on the physical conditions of a given segment, differences in local regulations
and processes, and even the source of development funding.

Wetland and Nonwetland Waters
Detailed information on wetlands, nonwetland waters, and floodplains in the larger
CCRT study area can be found in Plan Report No. 1. Features potentially impacted by
the preferred alternatives are summarized in Table 18. Wetland and stream impacts in

                  Clean Water Services (CWS)
                  CWS is the surface water management regulatory authority for urban Washington County.
                  Trail development may trigger CWS standards to protect sensitive areas and vegetated
                  corridors, and mitigation and enhancement may be required. Although CWS does not
                  have jurisdiction outside of the UGB, CWS standards are recommended in CCRT’s rural
                  unincorporated sections (Segment 2).

                  CWS standards3 allow pedestrian or bicycle trail crossings of vegetated corridors. Trails
                  have to be designed and constructed to protect water quality and mitigate any impacts to
                  public stormwater systems. Vegetated swales and/or dry basins are required to provide
                  on-site treatment of all stormwater runoff from paved trails. Standards for percent covered
                  by native trees, shrubs and groundcover could particularly apply to trails through riparian
                  corridors. More than 50 percent tree canopy has to be preserved, or variances obtained
                  or off-site mitigation provided. Invasive nonnative species are to be removed, and a
                  native plant revegetation plan developed to restore the corridor to “good condition.”

                  Paths between 12 and 14 feet wide are an allowed use if constructed using low impact
                  development approaches in accordance with Chapter 4,4 Runoff Treatment and Control. If
                  these conditions cannot be met, this wider pathway must be permitted in accordance with
                  Section 3.07, Encroachment Standards.5 Paths up to 12 feet wide, including any structural
                  embankments, are permitted outright if:
                    •	 Constructed to minimize disturbance to existing vegetation and maintain slope
                       stability.
                    •	 For the Tualatin River, located no closer than 30 feet from the 2-year, 24-hour design
                       storm elevation.
                    •	 For all other sensitive areas, the path is located in the outermost 40 percent of the
                       vegetated corridor.
                    •	 The area of the path beyond the first 3 feet of width is mitigated in accordance with
                       Section 3.08, Replacement Mitigation Standards.
                    •	 Path construction does not remove native trees greater than 6 inches diameter at
                       breast height.
                  Other Permitting Processes
                  Table 19 lists the most likely trail development environmental and use permitting and/
                  or compliance processes. Plan Report No. 1 – Existing Conditions provides additional
                  information to help identify the particular trail sections or structures to which different
                  permitting might apply.

6: Phasing Plan
Many factors will influence actual CCRT construction phasing and time frames. The
timing and feasibility of property acquisition, which will be exclusively on a willing
seller basis, and availability of construction funding are primary drivers. Phasing will
also be influenced by changing jurisdictional authority and priorities, public and private
development, and evolving regional and local plans. The building of specific trail sections
and structures may change phasing priorities over time. Phasing should be periodically
reviewed and adjusted in light of such factors.

Phasing Criteria
The following phasing criteria are not in order of importance nor weighted. Higher
priority trail segments or sections will demonstrate some combination of the following
characteristics:
                                   Table 20. Phasing Criteria

                                   •	 Crucial link without which other sections would not be functional.
                                 The benefits of a specific trail section or structure are distinctly

Corridor Phasing
Development of the West-East Corridor – RAIL 1 (Forest Grove to Hillsboro) has general
priority over the North-South Corridor – EAST 1 (Banks to Forest Grove). The reasons for
prioritizing RAIL 1 over EAST 1 are:
 •	 RAIL 1 will serve larger urban concentrations of commuting and recreational users of
    all types and modes.
 •	 There are no suitable interim options for a trail from Forest Grove to Hillsboro.
 •	 There are no land acquisition costs or timing constraints (other than funding
    availability) on RAIL 1.
 •	 Motorized vehicle traffic volumes along most of EAST 1 are relatively low. Interim
    shared-use solutions may suffice in the near-term.


                                                                                                               73

                  Rail-with-Trail Phasing (RAIL 1)
                  The phasing of RAIL 1 is complicated by current freight rail service and future MAX or
                  high capacity transit service. The recommended multiuse rail-with-trail improvement has
                  an estimated total cost of over $22 million and will almost certainly have to be phased.
                  The linear nature of RAIL 1 does not lend to easily defined stages. Although jurisdictional
                  boundaries could be used, staged sections generally defined by major cross streets are
                  suggested.

                  The staging of RAIL 1 from west to east is recommended. The west and center sections
                  of RAIL 1 primarily cross through urbanized areas with multiple options to enter and exit
                  the trail – cross streets, sidewalks, and bicycle lanes. Higher density urban populations
                  would immediately benefit from a linear trail spanning Forest Grove and Cornelius.

                  On the east end of RAIL 1 toward Hillsboro, lower densities and fewer cross streets
                  could result in trail users being left with no acceptable options (to both the users and
                  surrounding neighborhoods) to exit and enter the trail until RAIL 1 was completely
                  constructed. In addition, west to east phasing will provide additional time to determine if
                  the existing rail bridge across Dairy Creek (Segment 6) could be re-used, thus saving the
                  $2.6 million needed for a complex-to-engineer new trail bridge paralleling the existing rail
                  bridge.

                  North-South Trail Corridor (EAST 1)
                  Development of the North-South Corridor is generally a LONG-TERM priority. Multiuse
                  trail development for EAST 1 should be managed so that continuous trail sections
                  between major road intersections are built as single stages. For example, the NW Porter
                  Road multiuse trail section should not be built until all required right of way between NW
                  Verboort Road and Oregon 47 is secured.

                  Staging sections notwithstanding, the actual phasing of the North-South Corridor street-
                  adjacent multiuse trail will be primarily dependent on the acquisition of additional right of
                  way. Partner jurisdictions must be ready to identify and act on opportunities to acquire
                  necessary right of way along the Greenville-Evers-Osterman-Visitation-Verboort-Porter
                  sections of EAST 1, with the long-term goal of assembling enough land to build functional
                  rural street-adjacent multiuse trail sections that gradually replace the near-term interim
                  shared-use solution (see pages 77–78).

                  Corridor Phasing Exceptions
                  The following north-south trail sections should be given NEAR-TERM priority.

                  EAST 1: Undercrossing of Oregon 6 at Oregon 47/Main Street (Banks)
                  Considerable safety and functionality benefits accrue from a relatively inexpensive
                  (estimated at $750,000) widening of the Oregon 47/Main Street undercrossing of Oregon
                  6. Conflicts between bicycle/pedestrian and motorized vehicle traffic crossing under the
                  highway would be significantly reduced, and access to existing bike lanes and sidewalks
                  in downtown Banks and to the Banks-Vernonia Trailhead greatly improved.

                  This undercrossing improvement would require approach trails on the west side of
                  Oregon 47/Main Street from the northwest ramp of Oregon 6 intersecting with Main

connect to the balance of the future EAST 1 street-adjacent trail.

EAST 1: Community of Verboort
Recommended NEAR-TERM improvements include:

 •	 Shared-use signing and/or pavement markings on NW Heesacker Road, the south
    500 feet of NW Visitation Road, and the north 500 feet of NW Porter Road.
 •	 Shoulder widening on NW Visitation Road, and a widened sidewalk on the north side
    NW Verboort Road, as well as signing and pavement markings.
 •	 Improved arterial bicycle/pedestrian roadway crossing of NW Verboort Road at the
    intersection with NW Heesacker Road.
EAST 1: Interim Shared-Use On-Street Improvements
Vehicle traffic volumes along many sections of EAST 1 (NW Evers Road, NW Osterman
Road, NW Visitation Road, NW Porter Road, and possibly NW Greenville Road) are low
enough that on-street shared-use solutions and/or roadway shoulder widening may be
economic and safe trail alternatives. Portions of this route are also along the Tualatin
Valley Scenic Bikeway (TVSB), which may be programmed by the County for spot
improvements in the NEAR-TERM.

Shared-use is therefore recommended as a practical interim solution through Segments
1, 2, and 3 until funding and property is secured to build functional multiuse trail sections.
 •	 Bicycle route signing and/or pavement markings for shared-use should be added
    or improved along EAST 1 roadways to establish an interim CCRT route generally
    following the recommended long-term street-adjacent trail alignment between Banks
    and Forest Grove. The TVSB overlaps with EAST 1 along NW Greenville Road, NW
    Osterman Road, NW Visitation Road, and NW Porter Road.
 •	 As the Oregon 47 section of EAST 1 (Segment 2) carries higher motorized-vehicle
    volumes and speeds making shared-use potentially unsafe, the CCRT interim shared-
    use solution should be temporarily extended along the NW Greenville-NW Roy-NW
    Wilkesboro section of the TVSB, rejoining Oregon 47 immediately south of the Banks
    and Oregon 6 interchange at NW Wilkesboro Road.

                                    Road intersection. The Oak Street alternative is simpler and less expensive than the
RD                                  NW Martin Road alternative but requires two new arterial roadway bicycle/pedestrian
                                    crossings of Oregon 47 (at Oak Street and the rail crossing). The major future intersection
                                    improvements at NW Martin Road will require only one new arterial bicycle/pedestrian
                                    crossing.

                                    The cost of bicycle and pedestrian facilities and trail sections associated with the Oregon
                                    47/Martin Road option are estimated to be $400,000 greater than the Oak Street option,
                                    even though Oak will require an additional arterial crossing.

7: Funding Opportunities
Trail development and enhancement funding sources are summarized in Tables 22 and
23. Terms and conditions will change from time to time, new programs may emerge
or others may sunset, and funding cycles and levels will vary. Funding or construction
planning should be preceded by a review of current programs and cycles.

Construction Funding
Transportation and parks system development charges (SDC) are assessed by trail
partner jurisdictions against new development. Although limited to funding extra-capacity
capital improvements to meet the demands generated by new development, SDCs could
be available to apply to regional trail development within a jurisdiction’s boundary. Other
jurisdictions collect street utility fees to underwrite operations and maintenance costs,
another possible funding source for trails.

Enhancement Funding
Funding may also be available to underwrite specific elements or types of trail
construction, or to provide enhancements or mitigation within trail corridors. Such funds
are summarized in Table 23. These funds are sometimes sourced from federal or state
government, with state or regional agencies administering allocation and award. Locally
sourced funds may also be available.

Committee Meeting and Communication Protocols 
 
Decision‐making Processes 
All three project committees will strive to reach consensus decisions on Master Plan deliverables and 
recommendations. The PMT’s Parametrix representative shall be “non‐voting”. 
      Consensus is defined as the point where all committee members agree on the best option, even 
         if it is not each member’s personal preference. 
      If consensus cannot be reached, the committees will be encouraged to narrow the possibilities 
         by making majority/minority recommendation(s). Any committee member that still has a 
         strongly held divergent viewpoint may ask that their position be included in the meeting record. 
      While committee input is highly valued and essential to the success of the Master Plan project, 
         all actions of the three committees are advisory. The City of Forest Grove and ODOT reserve the 
         final decision‐making authority for all Master Plan recommendations and for directing the 
         activities of Parametrix.   
 
Meeting Agreements 
Committee members are volunteers and will have limited time to consider Master Plan findings and 
deliverables. In addition, the Master Plan project budget and scope is set by contract with ODOT. The 
ability to extend meetings, re‐consider recommendations, or add or extend tasks will be highly 
constrained. In order to assure that committee meetings are the most productive, the following meeting 
agreements are suggested: 
      Treat fellow committee members, project staff, and audience members, if any, with respect. 
      Share the floor – let others speak once before speaking twice. Listen carefully with the intent of 
         understanding the positions and statements of other committee members. 
      Collaborate with other committee members, and project staff and consultants, in seeking to find 
         consensus. 
      Help create an atmosphere in which differences can be raised, discussed and melded into group 
         decisions. Divergent views and opinions are expected and are to be respected.  
      Be an active member of the committee. Make every effort to attend every committee meeting. 
         The committees will not revisit information provided or decisions made in your absence.  




Council Creek Trail Advisory Committee Roles and Responsibilities                                  5
        Represent your designated constituents, but ultimately strive to set aside personal or 
         constituent interests in order to seek the best solutions for all stakeholders and future users of 
         the trail. 
        Focus questions and comments on the subject at hand and on the published agenda, unless 
         committee members agree by consensus to add or remove agenda or discussion items. 
        When discussing agenda items and project issues, apply your comments to the subject at hand, 
         not to personalities or personal disagreements. Raise issues honestly, clearly and early, and 
         share differences of opinion – silence is considered consent. 
        Turn off cell phones, pagers, laptops, and other communication devices, except when using such 
         devices will help to move forward issues associated with the agenda. 
        Refrain from conducting non‐project business during committee meetings. If you must take a 
         priority call or have to conduct a necessary time‐specific non‐project conversation, please 
         excuse yourself from the meeting and return as soon as possible. The committees will not revisit 
         information provided or decisions made in your absence.  
        Notify the City of Forest Grove if you are unable to attend a meeting or project event. Indicate if 
         an alternate representative will be attending in your place. 
 
Communications 
Acting as liaisons to constituents, appointed and elected officials, the public, and other groups and 
stakeholders is a key responsibility of all committee members. Outside communications by committee 
members on the Master Plan process and findings are encouraged. However these communications 
need to be consistent. The following guidelines are suggested: 
     Members will be expected to report at each committee meeting on their liaison activities and 
        what they are hearing back from constituents and the public.  
     Members will not engage in outside actions or discussions in a manner that misrepresents 
        committee processes or decisions. Members are free to express their disagreement or issues 
        with committee decisions, but should do so in the context of accurately representing the 
        decisions and recommendations of the full committee. 
     Members will refrain from trying to reverse or change committee decisions or 
        recommendations by engaging with outside parties to unduly influence other committee 
        members. Disagreement or dissent is legitimate but it should be expressed in the context of 
        committee decision‐making processes and recorded as a minority or individual position. 
     Members can suggest agenda items by contacting the City project manager. Between 
        committee meetings, members should also provide the City project manager with reports of any 
        comments, issues, or concerns they are hearing from outside sources or constituents.  
     Members will notify the City project manager about any news media inquiries, and refer 
        requests for official statements or viewpoints.

COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN




F-2 │ March 2015
COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN  
PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT PLAN 
 
INTRODUCTION and OVERVIEW 
The Council Creek Regional Trail Public Involvement Plan (PIP) serves as a guide for outreach 
activities throughout the Master Plan process. The PIP will be implemented with two distinct 
audiences in mind. The first audience includes stakeholders with specific advocacy, location, 
property, or jurisdictional interests in the Master Plan. The second audience is the general 
public that may engage as it relates to specific concerns or general interests.  
 
Public involvement activities will include both traditional and social media, a project web site, 
and coordination with the Master Plan’s jurisdictional partners. Targeted interactions with 
specific groups and interests through key stakeholder interviews and the project’s broad‐based 
stakeholder advisory committee, and general interactions at project open houses will be 
publicized through a variety of media and direct notice activities that will assure a high level of 
contact with and participation by multiple audiences.    
 
In addition to the specific outreach events described in this PIP, a Stakeholder Advisory 
Committee (SAC) will meet three (3) times in the course of the Master Plan process to provide 
advice and recommendations. The SAC will be an important means for engaging stakeholders, 
encouraging deliberation in the formation of recommendations and building understanding 
about Master Plan decisions. Details on the SAC’s purpose, membership and meeting schedule 
are included in Attachment A ‐ Committee Roles and Responsibilities. 
 
PROJECT GOALS 
The Master Plan will recommend a comprehensive strategy for the completion of an 
uninterrupted 15‐mile long regional trail from downtown Hillsboro, Oregon through the cities 
of Cornelius and Forest Grove, thence north through unincorporated Washington County to the 
City of Banks. The trail study corridor is divided into seven segments based on the differing 
attributes along the corridor, which include older neighborhoods, business and industrial areas, 
riparian stream corridors, and rural farmlands. 

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT GOALS 

   Ensure effective coordination and communication between jurisdictional partners and 
    stakeholders and related projects taking place within the trail study corridor. 
   Engage local jurisdictions, utilities, neighborhoods, property owners, citizens, bicycle and 
    pedestrian advocates, area non‐profits, businesses, and other stakeholders directly in 
    master plan development.  
   Guide jurisdictional partners on future planning, design, permitting, and development of 
    the trail.  


                                                                                                    1
   Host activities and provide tools that will add value to the project and genuinely engage 
    the community in an open and transparent process. 
   Keep the public informed with accurate, up‐to‐date information. 
   Build trust and a long‐term relationship with the community. 
   Maintain a level of flexibility with the process. 
       	
OBJECTIVES and OUTCOMES 
In order to achieve the preceding goals, the project will offer multiple opportunities to engage:  
 
One‐on One Involvement 
Key stakeholder interviews will be a primary strategy for early outreach, enabling the project 
team to understand the corridor’s opportunities and challenges from a local level. As each 
stakeholder or group of stakeholders is interviewed, new stakeholders are likely to be 
identified. 
 
Information Sharing  
 Project updates available on the project web site and from links on project partner web 
    sites, as well as by project postcards, newsletters and newsfeeds.  
 Formal open houses as specified in the project consultant’s contract.  
 Jurisdictional partners will share project information at key milestones via a number of 
    methods depending on the desired audience, information to be shared, feedback needed 
    and timing. This could include outreach by jurisdictional partners at other community 
    events, at community centers, or other community gathering places. The jurisdictional 
    partners may also hold targeted meetings with stakeholders as needed. 
 
Comments and Preferences 
Throughout the development of the master plan, the overall public process will allow 
interested parties to engage with the project. The communication process will provide the 
public with easy access to project information, the ability to get questions answered and the 
ability to provide feedback on the plan and process.  
 
AUDIENCES and OUTCOMES 
Target and general audiences will be asked to review project information, share it with those 
they know, engage with each other, and provide comments and preferences in writing or at 
public open houses.  
 Residents/Neighbors – those who live within the trail study corridor that may be impacted 
    most directly by trail route options. 
   Businesses – those who operate businesses or work in the trail study corridor. 
   Commuters – those who travel through the trail study corridor.  



                                                                                                 2
   Advocacy groups – groups with a particular interest in the trail, for example groups focused 
    on increasing travel by foot or by bicycle, etc. 
   Underrepresented populations ‐ particularly the trail study corridor’s large Hispanic 
    population. 
	
KEY MESSAGES 
Key project messages may be refined as the master plan progresses. Some messages may be 
emphasized at certain times based on the event purpose, timing and audience. Key messages 
are: 
 
    1. The Council Creek Regional Trail will create new connections within communities and 
       between communities.  
     
       Linking diverse community destinations along the trail corridor will increase 
       opportunities to bike and walk for recreational, shopping, and commuter purposes. The 
       trail will provide access between homes, commercial destinations, schools, and transit, 
       as well as provide a continuous bicycle and pedestrian link from the city of Hillsboro to 
       the city of Banks with access to Cornelius, Forest Grove, and farming communities in 
       Washington County in‐between. 
     
    2. The Council Creek Regional Trail will support increased health and well‐being through 
       recreation and exercise, as well as improving air quality by providing for safe and 
       convenient non‐motorized transportation options.  
     
       Motorized transportation is responsible for nearly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions, 
       and is a significant source of air pollution. Studies show that households living near a 
       greenway or trail are more likely to meet nationally recognized measures of health. 
 
    3. The Council Creek Regional Trail is supported by local communities, and has already 
       been included in nearly all regional and local land use plans in the area.  
     
    4. The Council Creek Regional Trail will keep dollars in the local economy by providing 
       safe alternative means to make trips between neighborhoods, shops and jobs.  
     
       As automobile, fuel and insurance prices rise, the percentage of household dollars going 
       to transportation significantly increases. Biking and walking are an affordable and 
       healthy alternative. Studies have shown that businesses are investing in locations 
       accessible by trails to attract and retain employees.  
 
    5. Local governments are working together with residents, businesses and community 
       organizations to create the Council Creek Regional Trail.  
     


                                                                                               3
            First and foremost, the purpose of this trail is to serve neighborhoods, citizens, 
            businesses, commuters, and recreational users. They serve on the master plan advisory 
            committees and are guiding the process. Local governments and jurisdictional partners 
            include the cities of Banks, Forest Grove, Cornelius and Hillsboro; Washington County; 
            Metro; and the Oregon Department of Transportation.

TOOLS and TASKS 
A successful master plan will reflect the interests and desires of the local community. A variety 
of public information materials and activities will be developed and refined in the course of 
master planning and public outreach processes to keep interested parties informed and to 
invite participation at key milestones. Informational materials (e.g., newsletters and meeting 
                                                                                                      4
advertisements) will be disseminated at specific points in the master plan process and made 
available on an ongoing basis through the project website and other media platforms. A 
stakeholder database will be developed and expanded as the master plan progresses. 
 
Stakeholder Interviews 
Interviews will be conducted with key stakeholders. Interviewed stakeholders will include but 
are not limited to citizen participation organizations (CPO), other neighborhood associations, 
utilities and railroads owning or controlling lands within the trail corridor, property owners, 
governmental service providers not otherwise represented on a project committee, bicycle and 
trail advocacy associations, and area non‐profits. 
 
Stakeholder Advisory Committee 
This committee will advise the project team on constituency and community concerns and 
issues, as well as serve as a forum to provide information and contacts that will help advance 
the master plan, review and evaluate master plan findings and deliverables, assist in 
considering options and alternatives, and build consensus recommendation(s) as to draft and 
final master plan findings and conclusions. Members will also serve as liaisons to their 
constituents by sharing information and gathering additional input.   
 
Electronic Media 
Information will be continually updated on the project web site and the jurisdictional partners 
will use other social media tools to provide people with an understanding of the current work 
of the project as well as background and next steps. Opportunities for public engagement will 
be clearly delineated. Jurisdictional partners will also be encouraged to provide links on their 
organizational web site to project resources. 
 
Email Alerts 
Email addresses available through the project mailing list will be used to send updates at 
project milestones. The jurisdictional partners may also share information through other 
communication networks as appropriate.  
 
Media Outreach 
The jurisdictional partners will proactively work with local media to describe the project, 
explain its timeline, highlight opportunities for involvement, discuss relevant issues and frame 
intended outcomes. Articles, event listings, and public notices will be submitted to community 
newspapers and newsletters and other media outlets as appropriate. 
 
Presentations 
Presentations will be a primary avenue for communications with stakeholders, the public, and 
the appointed and elected decision‐making bodies of jurisdictional partners. Open houses 
featuring project presentation will be held, and meetings will be scheduled to present the draft 
master plan to elected or appointed bodies. 
 
 

                                                                                               5
Public Events 
To share information and request public feedback, the project team will hold an open house at 
two master plan milestones. Participants will have an opportunity to ask questions and offer 
comments on project proposals and ideas.  
 
Outreach events associated with the trail alignment alternative and draft master plan 
milestones will open with presentations on current master plan outcomes and findings at the 
time of the milestone. The two events will also include a facilitated question and answer 
session, followed by participant interaction in an “open house” setting. The meetings will 
include a comment form/online survey to capture public feedback. The project team will also 
capture public comments at the events.  
 
Meeting Materials 
A meeting announcement will be sent in advance of the two outreach events to all property 
owners within the trail study corridor and to other interested parties that have requested 
notification or that have been identified by the jurisdictional partners. The following materials 
will be produced in conjunction with each round of outreach events: 
 
 One project informational postcard, one newsletter article, one Metro newsfeed release, 
     one power point presentation and one public web‐based survey.   
   Project website content. 
   One set of large format informational displays.  
   Posters distributed to local businesses and organizations in the project area. 
 
Displays, visual renderings, illustrations 
Display boards, PowerPoint presentations, sketches, renderings, illustrations or still 
photographs may be used to describe potential trail alignments and other master plan findings 
and recommendation at outreach events.   
 
PROJECT SCHEDULE 
Public engagement will be ongoing throughout the entire master plan process. The detailed 
project schedule is included in Attachment A ‐ Committee Roles and Responsibilities. 
 
MEASUREMENT and EVALUATION 
A summary of all public involvement activities and outcomes will be compiled at the conclusion 
of the master plan. The summary will include individual public event records, stakeholder 
interviews, public comments, survey responses and also describe how public and stakeholder 
input helped shape the master plan. 
 
Successful communication will be evidenced by a clear understanding of the project 
alternatives and timeline and participation in opportunities for engagement and the decision‐
making process. This will be measured by the following: 

                                                                                                     6
   
     The overall attendance and the number of documented direct contacts made with 
      community members at outreach events, and the number of “hits” on the project website. 
     The number of community members submitting comments on the master plan through 
      outreach event surveys, the project website, and by other means; and/or requesting 
      follow‐up information. 
     The outreach participants that indicate that the master plan outreach program was 
      effective based on outreach event surveys, the project website, and from other input. 
     An assessment of the degree to which targeted audiences and populations were engaged 
      in project development. 
     The level and type (i.e., positive or negative) of media interest in the project. 
	
PIP AMENDMENTS 
PIP amendments may be necessary as master plan findings, outcomes and recommendations 
emerge. Changes will primarily relate to the type, frequency, locations and targeted audiences 
for outreach events and activities.

COUNCIL CREEK REGIONAL TRAIL MASTER PLAN  
Hispanic Community Outreach Background 

The Council Creek Regional Trail is located at the western edge of the Portland metropolitan region to 
serve as a primary transportation and recreational facility for bicycle and pedestrian travel. The Project 
study area includes four (4) cities and portions of unincorporated Washington County. The study area 
extends from the City of Hillsboro Regional Center at the existing western terminus of the region’s MAX 
light rail system, through the City of Cornelius, City of Forest Grove and unincorporated Washington 
County to the City of Banks, a distance of approximately fifteen (15) miles.  
 
Between 2000 and 2010, the population of the cities and counties in the study area has grown at a 
faster rate than the state average of 12% (Table 1). The smallest jurisdiction in the study area, Banks, has 
grown by nearly 40% and the City of Hillsboro has seen an overall population increase of 30.5%. Much of 
this growth is attributed to a large increase in the Hispanic population in the area.

Oregon's Hispanic population grew by nearly 64% from 2000‐2010, and continues to grow (Table 2).  The 
City of Banks had an increase of 150% while the other cities in the study area saw their Hispanic 
population increase by over 50%. More than 80 percent of Hispanics in Oregon are of Mexican ancestry. 
Washington County is the metro area's most racially diverse area, with people of color accounting for 
three of 10 residents (The Oregonian, 2011).

The Council Creek Trail Master Plan will seek feedback from interested and affected parties, diverse 
communities and environmental justice populations. Strategies for outreach to the area’s Hispanic 
populations include posting open house announcements and communications in Spanish to the 
following sources:  

           Adelante Mujeres 
           El Hispanic News 
           Centro Cultural de Washington County 
           Hillsboro Futsal 
           Local churches and schools with large Hispanic populations 
           Hillsboro Arts & Culture Council  

Community events are excellent locations in which to engage the community and there are various 
located throughout the study area. Farmers markets are popular in Washington County and have high 
rates of attendance from community members. The follow table lists the farmers markets in the study 
area. Local athletic events, such as soccer games, are also venues in which large numbers of the 
community attend, pose as potential venues for outreach.

Adelante Mujeres, a non‐profit in Forest Grove that works to educate and empower low‐income Latina 
women, recently completed a “Photovoice” project with Oregon Walks titled ‘“Walking: para vida, 
familia, y comunidad”. In the project, more than twenty women from Adelante Mujeres’ English class 
took photos and shared their stories to demonstrate why walking matters and what is needed to make 
their communities safer and more walkable. Working with Adelante Mujeres will ensure there is 
participation, input and engagement from the Hispanic community on the Council Creek trail project.  

Metro also offers the ‘¡Vámonos!’ project which encompasses a bilingual mapping project to help 
people in Cornelius, Forest Grove and Hillsboro learn about great places to walk and bike in their 
communities. The maps are free to the public and highlight points of interest, history, commerce and 
transit stops as well as highlight parks, trails and natural areas.

Appendix G: Conceptual Community Trails
In recommending preferred regional trail alignments and types, the PAC and SAC also
considered the need for additional community and local-scale trails connecting to the
CCRT. Such trails could provide access from the CCRT to schools, streams and natural
areas, and community services.

As such trails will be the sole responsibility of local jurisdictions or public property owners,
the PAC/SAC decided not to make specific recommendations. The committees did,
however, direct that a map be prepared conceptually showing the general locations of
possible community trail routes and included as an appendix to this master plan report
(see Map 17).

In addition, the City of Forest Grove has adopted a trail and bicycle/pedestrian system
plan termed the “Emerald Necklace.” See Forest Grove’s Community Trails Plan,
Comprehensive Plan, and Transportation System Plan, as well as the Washington County
Transportation System Plan for more details on the Emerald Necklace. The cities of
Banks and Hillsboro are in the final stages of new trail system plans, and these efforts
should also be integrated into the development of the CCRT.

Study Area
       The Urban Growth Expansion (UGB) area consists of two parts. The Northeast UGB area
       is primarily north of Baseline and south of the Council Creek flood plain, just east of the
       current City limits. The Southeast UGB area is north of the Tualatin River flood plain and
       west of 345th Avenue. These areas are shown in the map below.




Water Infrastructure – Northeast UGB Area
       The City of Hillsboro currently provides water service to the Northeast UGB.
       Attachment 1 shows the current system. While Hillsboro and Cornelius have had very
       preliminary talks regarding Cornelius taking over the water system in this area, the City
       of Cornelius has been cool to the idea because much of the system in the area is
       undersized and does not meet current standards.

       Attachment 2 shows the improvements that are likely needed to bring the water system
       in this area up to City of Cornelius standards. Most of the improvements involve
       upgrading the existing lines to 8” and adding fire hydrants. The line on 341st is shown as
       a 12” line based on the assumption that without a looped system, any significant
       development north of the railroad will need a 12” line to achieve adequate flow.




                                                                                                   1
       The cost of bringing the water infrastructure in this area up to current standards is
       approximately:

                                      4,000 LF @ $130/LF = $520,000

       This cost cannot be justified based on the limited amount of water user fee revenue the
       area would produce. Therefore, if the Northeast UGB area is annexed to the City of
       Cornelius, the annexation will likely occur in small chunks as development occurs. With
       each annexation, Cornelius will take over the portion of the water system needed to
       serve that area. The development necessitating the annexation will be primarily
       responsible for improving the annexed part of the Hillsboro water system to Cornelius
       standards.

       Storage needs for the Northeast UGB area can be easily handled by the City’s current
       1.5 MG (million-gallons) above ground reservoir and its 50+MG Aquifer Storage and
       Recovery (ASR) System scheduled to come on line in 2017.

       Flow needs for this area can be handled from three sources.

           1. 12” Cornelius main line on the north side of Baseline that currently ends at East
              Lane
           2. 12” Cornelius main line on the south side of Baseline that currently ends at the
              Coastal Farm Store at about 336th Avenue
           3. Existing but unused transfer station from the Hillsboro 72” transmission line in
              Baseline to the Cornelius system at East Lane


       In summary, the City of Cornelius can easily serve the Northeast UGB area. The primary
       concern is the fact that most pipes in this area are substandard. Bringing this area up to
       current standards is an expensive proposition that is not currently programed into the
       Cornelius water rate structure. Therefore, improvements to the water infrastructure in
       this area will be required at the time of development. Until areas are annexed into the
       City the system within this area will remain within Hillsboro’s service district and will be
       maintained and operated by Hillsboro.


Water Infrastructure Needs – Southeast UGB Area
       The Southeast UGB area represents a clean slate in that the area contains almost no
       existing water infrastructure. The only public water facility in the area is a 2” plastic line
       from Baseline south along 345th to serve approximately 8 residents within ¼ mile of
       Baseline. Since most of these residents are outside the UGB expansion area, the City
       does not intend to upgrade this 2” plastic line in the foreseeable future. However, the
       south end of this line may be looped into the new water infrastructure in the UGB area
       to protect against an emergency such as a line break.


                                                                                                    2
       When developed, the Southeast UGB area will be served by 12” mains under the
       planned collector streets. The collector streets are expected to include: 29th south of
       Baseline, 26th and 20th south of Ginger, Dogwood east of 28th, and a new east-west
       collector south of the current city limits that connects 20th, 26thand 29th. All local streets
       will be underlain with 8” water mains, the minimum standard required by Cornelius.

       In addition, to provide adequate flow and pressure to this area at build-out, some
       improvements in the City’s existing water system may be required. The needed
       improvements will be determined when the City completes its water master plan
       update later this year. However, the improvements to the existing system that are likely
       to be needed at full development of the UGB area include:

           •   12” line to replace existing 8” line in Dogwood from 18th to 20th
           •   12” line to replace 8” line in 20th from Dogwood to Southeast UGB area
           •   12” line to replace 8” line in 26th from Dogwood to Southeast UGB area

       These improvements are not needed initially, but will be required as the area nears
       build-out. When the City’s water master plan update is completed in late 2015, the
       amount of development the existing system can support will be determined. For
       development that occurs before the master plan update is complete, the developer will
       be responsible for proving that the existing system can provide adequate flow and
       pressure to the UGB area. If adequate flow and pressure cannot be attained, the
       developer will need to make the improvements noted above.

       Storage needs for the Southeast UGB area can be handled by the City’s current 1.5 MG
       above ground reservoir and its 50+MG Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) System
       scheduled to come on line in 2017.


Water Infrastructure Costs – Southeast UGB Area
       All the new water mains in the Southeast UGB area will be installed and funded by
       developers. However, the City must pay for oversizing of lines greater than 8” size. In
       other words, while the developers are responsible for funding the installation of 8” lines
       under all the streets in this area, the City must fund the additional cost of 12” lines
       where they are needed. The cost of this upsizing of lines to 12” is estimated to be:

               12” oversize cost in UGB area = ~10,000 LF @ $20/LF = $200,000

       Furthermore, the City must fund improvements to piping outside the UGB area. These
       improvements are listed above and will cost approximately:

               12” replacement lines inside UGB area = ~2,200 LF @ $140/LF = $300,000



                                                                                                   3
       Water SDCs from the southeast UGB area are expected to be:

              1,100 single family residences @ $3,884 SDC per residence = ~$4M

       Therefore, the water SDCs captured from the new development in the southeast UGB
       area are more than adequate to fund the improvements to pipes needed to serve this
       area.


Recommendations
     In the Northeast UGB area, staff recommends the area continue to be served by the City
     of Hillsboro until parcels are annexed. At the time parcels are annexed into the City of
     Cornelius, Cornelius should take over the portion of Hillsboro’s system needed to serve
     the annexed parcel. Developers should pay for all improvements needed to bring lines
     up to City of Cornelius standards.

       In the Southeast UGB area, developers should design and install all water mains. The
       City shall pay for oversizing mains under collectors to 12” from the 8” standard size. The
       City shall also design, build, and fund improvements necessary to the water mains
       within the current City boundaries.

         Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Areas
Subject: Conceptual Analysis of Wastewater Facilities Extensions

A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – KEY FINDINGS

      1. Southeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
          a. The extension of sewer service to the Southeast Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) Expansion Area (South
             Area) will require a pump station and force main.
          b. A central location for the South-Area pump station appears feasible and offers the most flexibility in
             developing the layout of the future South-Area collector sewers.
          c. It is preferable to have the wastewater (WW) generated by the new school in the northeast portion of the
             South Area conveyed by gravity to the new pump station serving the South Area.
          d. Under this concept, only the northwest portion of the South Area will be served by direct, gravity flow to
             the City’s existing sewer system.
          e. The WW generated in the South Area will be conveyed to the City’s existing South Trunk Sewer under
             Ginger Street. The preferred point of connection to the South Trunk is at 20th Avenue and Ginger.

      2. South Trunk Sewer Upgrade
          a. Our analysis confirms that the upper reaches of the South Trunk must be increased in size to handle existing
             and projected peak flows. These sewer reaches extend from Heather Street, through Free Orchards Park
             to Emerald Loop, and east along Ginger to 23rd Avenue.
          b. Within the scope of this study, we have identified 3,005 linear feet of the South Trunk that needs to be
             increased in size. The scope of our analysis excluded the South Trunk reaches downstream of Heather.

      3. Northeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
          a. A conceptual sewer layout has been developed for the Northeast Urban Growth Boundary Expansion Area
             (North Area) to show the feasibility of extending gravity sewer service to the area.
          b. The conceptual layout divides the North Area into four sewer sub-basins that would convey WW to the
             existing North-South Trunk Sewer and/or the existing Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
B. INTRODUCTION

      This technical memorandum describes the results of the analysis we performed to address sanitary sewer service
      extensions into the areas covered by the recent UGB expansion. The analysis was performed as part of the
      Comprehensive Planning process that is required for lands within the UGB.

      Planning-level concepts have been developed to document the feasibility of providing WW facilities in the UGB
      expansion areas and connecting these facilities to the existing WW infrastructure. The projected impacts of
      connecting these service extensions to the City’s existing sewer system have also been identified.

Technical Memorandum                                      Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

    Clean Water Services (CWS) will need to conduct a separate facilities planning process to address the projected
    impacts on downstream WW components owned by that agency.

C. SOUTHEAST UGB EXPANSION AREA SERVICE CONCEPT

    1. General Concept
        a. The sewer service concept for the South Area assumes future developments will generally follow existing
           local topography.
        b. Due to the general topography (sloping down toward the river), most of the South Area cannot be served
           by gravity sewers that would be tributary to the City’s existing sewer system. Therefore, gravity sewers
           for the South Area will need to be tributary to a future South Cornelius Pump Station (SCPS).
        c. The force main for the SCPS will discharge WW into the City’s existing South Trunk sewer located under
           Ginger Street (see Item 5 below for discharge options).
        d. The alignments of future South-Area gravity sewers and the SCPS force main will be affected by
           development patterns. Alignments shown in our conceptual layout are provided for illustration purposes.

    2. Projected WW Production
        a. Projected Build-Out Development:
                  Projected Residential – 1,200 DU
                  Projected Institutional (High School) – 2,500 Students
                  Projected Commercial & Industrial – None
        b. CWS Flow Criteria from West Basin Facilities Plan (Carollo, 2012) and other CWS input:
                  Average Residential Occupancy – 2.6 People/Dwelling Unit (DU)
                  Average Per Capita WW Flow – 67 Gallons per Capita/Day
                  I/I contributions from future developments on currently undeveloped land:
                    Near-term I/I Contribution Factor (25 years for PS planning) – 1,650 gpd/acre (gpad)
                    Long-term I/I Contribution Factor (50 years for sewer planning) – 4,000 gpad
        c. Projected Average Dry-Weather WW Flows at Build-Out.

    3. South Cornelius Pump Station
        a. Concept-Level PS Capacity – 750 gpm (Preliminary Projection for Build-Out and Near-term I/I).
        b. Approximate Minimum Elevation for Development – 156-160 feet
        c. Approximate PS Floor Level (Top of Wetwell) – Elevation 154-158 feet
        d. Approximate Sewer Inverts at Wetwell – Elevation 140-142 feet
        e. Potential PS Sites Identified for Planning (see Exhibit 1)
                  Site 1 – Central Location near swale south of 26th Avenue
                  Site 2 – SE Location between 345th Avenue and Tualatin River
                  Site 3 – SW Location near swale outlet to river
        f.     Site 1 is identified as the preferred site for planning purposes.
                  The more centralized site offers more flexibility in developing the tributary gravity sewers.
                  The central site helps to limit the maximum depth of the tributary gravity sewers.
                  The other two sites would probably require a lower inlet invert at the PS wetwell.

    4. School Site Service Options
        a. Sewer service to the school can be extended from the new South-Area collection system or potentially
           from the existing City sewer system to the west (see Exhibit 1).
        b. Gravity Flow South: This option would have WW from the school conveyed by gravity into the sewer
           system for the South Area tributary to the future SCPS.
        c. Gravity Flow West:
                  This option would have WW from the school conveyed by gravity into the City’s sewer system at the
                   east end of existing Dogwood Street.
                  Flows through the Dogwood sewer eventually reach the South Trunk Sewer at 23rd Avenue.
                  The ability to serve the school site from Dogwood would depend on the actual location and elevation
                   of the school, as well as the elevation, capacity and accessibility of the existing sewer in Dogwood.
        d. For planning purposes we show the school being served by the future South-Area sewers and SCPS. The
           reasons for this assumption are described below.
                  This approach provides a more conservative projection for the PS capacity.
                  There are concerns about accessibility for maintenance if sewer service were extended from Dogwood.
                  Because the WW contribution from the school is a small portion of the overall South-Area WW flow,
                   future impacts on the existing South Trunk Sewer would likely be similar for either option.

    5. South-Area Connection to City’s Existing Sewer System
        a. South-Area WW can be discharged into the existing South Trunk Sewer at either 20th Avenue or
           Webb/26th Avenue (see Exhibit 1)
        b. It is preferable to connect to the South Trunk Sewer at 20th Avenue because that is further downstream
           and will not impact the existing pipe between 26th and 20th.
        c. The force main from the SCPS can discharge to a gravity sewer in the South Area that will extend west
           and then north to the intersection of Ginger and 20th as shown in Exhibit 1. Based on the preliminary
           projection for the SCPS capacity and minimum sewer slope, this South-Area outlet sewer will need to be
           12 inches in diameter.

    6. Assumptions for Conceptual Layout
        a. The layout assumes the gravity sewers tributary to the SCPS would be 8 inches in diameter with a minimum
           slope of 0.5%.
        b. The layout assumes a minimum depth to the sewer invert of about 6 feet.

D. IMPACT OF SOUTH AREA ON EXISTING SYSTEM

    1. Scope
        Our study of downstream impacts from the South Area was limited to an analysis of the effect the projected
        peak hourly flow from projected development will have on an upper reach of the existing South Trunk Sewer.
        This section of the existing sewer extends under Ginger Street, Emerald Loop and the Free Orchards City Park
        to Heather Street, near 15th Avenue (see Exhibit 1).

    2. Background
        The 2012 CWS West Basin Facilities Plan (WBFP) previously identified capacity deficiencies in most of the
        South Trunk Sewer and recommended replacement of about 3,800 feet of this upper reach with larger pipe
        sizes.

    3. Purpose
        The purpose of our impact analysis is to provide updated recommendations for pipe replacements. The update
        is based on the peak flow projections we generated from the current land-use plan for the South Area (see
        Section C above) and more-recent information on I/I contributions provided by CWS.

    4. South Trunk Field Survey
        A field survey was performed of the manholes along the upper reach of the South Trunk from Heather Street
        to 26th Avenue. This survey established current data for existing pipe sizes, invert elevations and manhole rim
        elevations that were used to generate an updated model of this upper reach. The data is shown in Appendix A.

    5. South Trunk Analysis
        a. We evaluated the upper reach of the South Trunk by applying estimates of peak WW and infiltration/inflow
           contributions from currently developed areas and applying the projected near-term and long-term SCPS
           flow capacities at the preferred discharge point.
        b. We generated flow estimates from existing, tributary developments using criteria for WW generation listed
           in the WBFP and updated I/I criteria supplied by CWS. These estimates assume no redevelopment will
           occur in the tributary areas to significantly increase WW flows.
        c. Breakdowns of the estimated flows into the South Trunk are listed in Table 1 (following page) and shown
           in Exhibit 2. The projected peak WW flows from developed areas are similar to the WBFP, but do not
           coincide exactly. The projected I/I contributions are lower than the WBFP because CWS identified a
           lower, per-acre I/I contribution based on more-recent flow data the agency obtained for the South Trunk
           sub-basin.

    6. Results of Analysis
        The pipe replacements identified in our planning-level analysis of the South Trunk are listed in Table 2
        (following page). The results of our analysis are further described in the following paragraphs.
        a. Our results generally coincide with the recommendations of the WBFP from Heather (MH #20045)
           upstream to 20th and Ginger (MH #20034). An 18-inch sewer pipe is needed to convey projected peak
           flows through these segments for both the near-term and long-term I/I contributions from the South Area.

Issued Final                                           Page 4                                              08/10/2015
Technical Memorandum                                        Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

               The 18-inch pipe size assumes the existing, inverted siphons in Free Orchards Park will be replaced with
               straight, gravity sewers that will be laid aboveground across the low-lying swales. These sewers will need
               to be supported from pedestrian boardwalks or similar structures through these locations.
               Pipe bursting could potentially be used to replace the existing buried 12-inch sewer with an 18-inch pipe.
               However, the existing South Trunk has a fairly shallow depth of burial under Emerald Loop and where
               Ginger transitions to 18th Avenue. Consequently, surface heaving could be a major concern with pipe
               bursting in this stretch. Installation methods will need to be further addressed at a later stage of project
               development.
         b. Our analysis indicates a 12-inch pipe is needed for the pipe reach in Ginger between 20th and 23rd Avenues
            based on the average slope. This conclusion contrasts with the WBFP recommendation for a 15-inch pipe
            along this reach. The difference may result from the lower I/I contribution provided by CWS and a shift
            of the South-Area sewer connection further downstream along the South Trunk.
               It should be noted our survey of the MHs along the South Trunk shows one sewer length in this reach,
               between MHs #20031 and #20032, has a very mild slope of 0.07%. If this pipe were replaced through pipe
               bursting, it would continue to have a mild slope, which would reduce the pipe capacity and could promote
               solids deposition. This issue will need to be considered when evaluating installation methods for this reach.

E. NORTH EXPANSION AREA SERVICE CONCEPT

    1. General Concept:
        a. The conceptual sewer layout would provide gravity service to the North Area. The layout is shown in
               Exhibit 3.
        b. The sewer layout is generally based on current development patterns (layout of lots, streets & railroad)
               with most sewers following an existing R-O-W.
        c. The gravity sewers would be divided into four separate sub-basins: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and
               Southeast.
        d. All four sub-basins would be tributary to the Clean Water Services’ Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
    2. Projected WW Production
        a. Projected Build-Out Development:
                  Projected Residential – 480 DU
                  Projected Commercial – 6 acres
                  Projected Industrial & Institutional – None
        b. CWS Flow Criteria from West Basin Facilities Plan (Carollo, 2012) and other CWS input:
                  Average Residential Occupancy – 2.6 People/Dwelling Unit (DU)
                  Average Per Capita WW Flow – 67 Gallons per Capita/Day
                  Average flow contribution from commercial land – 1,000 gpd/acre (gpad)
                  Long-term I/I contribution from currently undeveloped land – 4,000 gpd/acre (gpad)
        c. Projected Average Dry-Weather WW Flows at Build-Out.
                  Projected Build-Out Population – 1,250 People
                  Projected Residential –83,620 Gallons per Day (gpd)
                  Projected Commercial – 6,000 gpd
                  Projected Total Average WW Flow – 89,620 gpd
        d. Projected Peak Build-Out WW Flows.
                  Estimated Peaking Factor – 4.0 (Peak-to-Average Flow Ratio)
                  Projected Peak WW Contribution – 358,500 gpd
                  Peak Infiltration/Inflow Allowance – 300,000 gpd (4,000 gpad x 75 net acres)
                  Projected Peak Flow – 660,000 gpd ≈ 460 gallons per minute (gpm)

    3. Sewer Drainage Pattern
        a. NW Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would drain to the west along the existing ODOT railroad R-O-W.
                  WW flows would discharge into an existing sewer that extends down from the Trailer Park to the
                   existing North-South Trunk Sewer.
                  The east boundary of the NW sub-basin is limited by a highpoint in the RR line between 338th and
                   341st Avenues. East of this point the RR grade slopes down to Dairy Creek.




Issued Final                                              Page 6                                        08/10/2015
Technical Memorandum                                      Comprehensive Plan Amendment – Wastewater Facilities

        b. NE Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would serve areas that generally slope to the north and east toward Council Creek or
                   Dairy Creek.
                  WW flows would discharge through a gravity sewer extending across the RR line and north along
                   334th Avenue to the existing Council Creek Trunk Sewer.
        c. SW Sub-basin
                  This sub-basin would generally drain west to the existing sewer along East Lane just north of Baseline
                   Street. The service concept is laid out to minimize the amount of area served by the SW Sub-basin
                   due to constraints posed by existing utilities in the Baseline R-O-W.
                  The existing sewer extending along Baseline is on the south side of the R-O-W. Gravity sewer service
                   from the area north of Baseline is prevented from discharging into this existing sewer by the 72-inch
                   water transmission main under the north side of Baseline.
                  Existing utilities along the north side of the Baseline R-O-W limit the space that would be available
                   for a new parallel sewer on the north side of Baseline.
                  The mobile home park on East and West Lanes is currently served by existing gravity sewers.
        d. SE Sub-basin
                  This Sub-basin would serve a small area on the south side of Baseline, east of the current City limit.
                  The area would be served by an extension of the existing 8-inch sewer that extends along the south
                   side of Baseline. The Baseline sewer discharges into the north-south trunk sewer.

    4. Approximate Peak WW Flow Distribution to Existing Trunk Sewers
        a. Approximate flow to N-S Trunk (NW, SW & SE Sub-basins) – 290,000 gpd (60%)
        b. Approximate flow directly to Council Creek Trunk (NE Sub-basin) – 195,000 gpd (40%)

    5. Assumptions for Conceptual Layout
        a. The layout assumes gravity sewers would be 8 inches in diameter with a minimum slope of 0.5%.
        b. The layout assumes a minimum depth to the sewer invert of 6 feet and a maximum depth of about 15 feet.

F. IMPACT OF NORTH AREA ON EXISTING SYSTEM

    1. City’s Baseline Street Sewer
        A small amount of additional WW from projected commercial development in the SE Sub-basin will discharge
        into the City’s existing sewer along the south side of Baseline. This projected WW contribution will be too
        minor to impact the existing sewer system.

    2. North-South Trunk Sewer
        The conceptual layout for the North Area would convey projected flows from the NW and SW Sub-basins into
        the existing CWS North-South Trunk Sewer. CWS records show this line extending from East Lane, just north
        of Baseline, up to the Council Creek Trunk Sewer. These records also show the line as an 8-inch pipe with
        most sections between manholes laid at a slope of 0.4%. The North-South Trunk sewer currently receives
        flows from collector sewers in Baseline and two other City collector sewers north of Baseline.
        If future development is evenly distributed throughout the North Area, the NW and SW Sub-basins could carry
        more than half the projected flows. Since an 8-inch pipe with a 0.4% slope has a capacity of about 0.5 MGD
        before surcharging, future flows from the NW and SW Sub-basins could surcharge the line. Future CWS
        facilities planning efforts will need to model the line to verify whether the North-South Trunk will be adequate.

    3. Council Creek Trunk Sewer
        The sewer service concept for the North Area results in all future WW flows generated in the area being
        conveyed to the Council Creek Trunk Sewer. The NE Sub-basin will drain directly to this line and the other
        sub-basins will be conveyed to this line through the North-South Trunk Sewer.
        CWS records show the Council Creek line as a 42-inch pipe between the North-South Trunk and 334th Avenue.
        This existing 42-inch pipe line would need to be at or very near capacity to be impacted at all by the projected
        WW flows from the North Area. Future CWS modeling of this line will need to address the potential for any
        impacts from the North Area.

G. ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE COST
    As part of the comprehensive planning process, we developed estimates of the probable project costs for the SCPS,
    the associated PS force main and downstream South-Area gravity sewer, and the South Trunk Sewer replacements.
    We used cost information presented in the WBFP as the basis for the estimates and then applied an inflation factor
    based on the 20-City Average Construction Cost Index (CCI) published by Engineering News Record (ENR).
    The probable project costs include a 30% allowance for construction contingencies and a 35% allowance for non-
    construction costs (engineering, environmental and legal services and project administration).

                 750-gpm South Cornelius Pump Station                             $     880,000
                 8-inch Force Main & 12-inch Downstream Gravity Sewer             $     650,000
                 South Trunk – Reach 1 Replacement (12-inch Sewer)                $     280,000
                 South Trunk – Reach 2-5 Replacement (18-inch Sewer)              $   1,450,000
                 Total Estimated Probable Project Costs                           $   3,260,000

               ** July 2015 ENR CCI = 10,037

    The level of detail of these cost estimates is consistent with Estimate Class 4 described by the Association for the
    Advancement of Cost Engineering International (Recommended Practice #18R-97, Rev. November 2011).
    Accordingly, the accuracy is anticipated to be within –25% to +35% of the actual cost.
    The actual cost of the improvements will depend on project scope, design development, and actual market
    conditions at bid time. Costs will also depend on specific site conditions and other variable factors. More detailed
    estimates of the probable costs will need to be prepared as part of further project planning and design efforts.

Study Area
       The Urban Growth Expansion (UGB) area consists of two parts. The Northeast UGB area
       is primarily north of Baseline and south of the Council Creek flood plain, just east of the
       current City limits. The Southeast UGB area is north of the Tualatin River flood plain and
       west of 345th Avenue. These areas are shown in the map below.




       The terrain in these two areas is generally flat. The Northeast area largely slopes to the
       north toward Council Creek. The only waterway in this area is a large wetland area that
       separates the UGB expansion area from the current City boundary. This wetland area
       drains north toward Council Creek.

       The Southeast area primarily slopes to the south toward the Tualatin River. The only
       waterway in this area is an agricultural ditch that starts where 26th Avenue turns into
       Webb Road and then traverses in a south-southwest direction toward the Tualatin
       River.




                                                                                                 1
Existing Stormwater Facilities
        The only existing stormwater facilities in the Northeast UGB area are roadside and
        trackside ditches along Baseline, the north-south streets traversing the area, and the
        railroad north of Baseline.

       The stormwater facilities in the Southeast UGB area are limited to the roadside ditches
       on 345th Avenue and railroad ditches along the railroad south of Baseline.

       As development occurs, these facilities are expected to be replaced with facilities
       meeting current Clean Water Service (CWS) standards.


Stormwater Standards Overview
      Any new development in the UGB expansion areas must at a minimum meet the current
      Design and Construction (D&C) Standards for Sanitary Sewer and Surface Water
      Management issued by CWS.

       Some UGB expansion areas in Washington County, notably Tigard’s River Terrace and
       the unincorporated North Bethany, created additional stormwater standards that go
       beyond the D&C Standards. In the case of River Terrace, severe erosion in the stream
       corridors coming off the south side of Bull Mountain necessitated a more stringent
       approach to stormwater control in the area.

       In North Bethany’s case, CWS desired to incorporate extensive LIDA (low-impact
       development practices) into the area and pre-built a number of large regional facilities.
       This was deemed more desirable to the creation of individual stormwater facilities in
       each development phase.

       One downside of the North Bethany approach is that CWS has had difficulty keeping
       ahead of development with new facilities. Also, by CWS constructing regional facilities
       rather than each developer constructing their own facilities, North Bethany has a large
       stormwater fee or system development charge that is unique in Washington County.

       Finally, the D&C Standards issued by CWS are expected to change significantly as a
       result of a new MS4 permit from the State of Oregon, Department of Environmental
       Quality (DEQ) to CWS. One change in the new MS4 permit will be an increased level of
       treatment for stormwater. However, the most significant change in the standards is
       expected to be a requirement to deal with hydro-modification. Instituting this type of
       requirement is expected to create the need for very large detention and retention
       facilities on new development sites.




                                                                                                   2
Cornelius Plan
       Because Cornelius does not face the problems Tigard does on Bull Mountain and
       because the City does not have the staff to plan, design, and build regional facilities, as
       CWS is doing in North Bethany, Cornelius will require developers to meet the current
       stormwater standards issued by CWS. While this approach is not innovative, it has been
       used successfully for decades in urban Washington County to manage stormwater
       runoff.

        The only variations from the CWS standards are:

           1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems, e.g., Stormfilters, for
              treatment on parts of the system that the City must maintain in the future, i.e.,
              facilities to be dedicated to the City.
           2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
              facilities.

        The reason for the prohibition on proprietary systems is the additional maintenance
        burden these pose for the City at a time when stormwater maintenance funding is
        extremely limited. Likewise, the single-family lot LIDA facilities require on-going City
        inspection and oversight that the City does not have funding to undertake.


Costs
        Since developers will be responsible for designing and constructing stormwater facilities
        in the new UGB areas, the City will incur zero capital costs for these systems. The City
        will, however, incur, increased maintenance costs long-term, but these costs are funded
        by monthly stormwater fees payable by the new residents and businesses in the area.


Recommendations
     Staff recommends the City use the CWS D&C Standards that are applicable at the time
     of development to address stormwater issues in the UGB areas. Staff further
     recommends, the following two conditions be placed on all new development in these
     areas:

           1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems for treatment on parts
              of the system that the City must maintain in the future.
           2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
              facilities.

5.     PRESENTATIONS
       A.      Proclamation: Thank a Police Officer Day-September 19, 2015
               City Manager Drake explained that Trudy Hauser, a local resident, brought it to Staff’s
               attention that Thank a Police Officer Day was a national effort. Staff and Police Chief
               Moss liked the idea and encouraged the City Council to adopt the proclamation.

               Mayor Dalin read the proclamation declaring September 19, 2015 as Thank a Police
               Officer Day.

       B.      Plastic Bag Ban:
               City Manager Drake said he had conferred with Mayor Dalin, who agreed hearing a
               presentation on the plastic bag ban was a good idea. He noted that a two-page handout
               about plastic bag use was included in the City Council Packet.

               Elaine Cole, Forest Grove Sustainability Commission, stated that she and Mr. Hayes had
               been working on banning plastic bags for almost a year. They drafted a plastic bag
               ordinance for the City of Forest Grove and were asked by the City Council in a work
               session to take the pulse of different cities in Washington County and talk to their
               sustainability colleagues, which was why she was making an effort to reach out. She
               appreciated the opportunity to speak to Council about this issue.

               John Hayes, Forest Grove Sustainability Commission, explained that the ordinance
               would ban single-use plastic checkout bags within the city limits of Forest Grove for all
               businesses. The ordinance would levy a 5 cent charge for use of paper bags, but there
               would be many exemptions, such as items that were wet or might leak so a plastic bag
               could be used. Pharmacy bags, bakery bags, fruits and vegetable bags, small hardware
               items, and dry-cleaning bags would all be exempt as well. The Sustainability Commission
               voted to bring the issue before City Council many reasons, and he noted the negative
               impact to wildlife, especially sea turtles and whales. He reviewed the results of a poll
               taken from 41 citizens at a public forum held last Wednesday, which asked questions
               about plastic bag use, including whether plastic bags were harmful to the environment,
               whether participants supported a plastic bag ban, and a series of questions about
               imposing a 5 cent paper bag fee or 10 cent plastic or paper bag fee, or offering a 25 cent
               credit for reusable bags with no ban on plastic bags. Based on the input from the public
               forum, the Forest Grove City Council was not going to ban plastic bags. The
               Sustainability Commission has its work cut out for them and he was sure the Cornelius
               City Council would be in the same situation if they were facing this issue.

               Ms. Cole explained behavior change research has shown that incurring a cost helped
               people change their behavior and made them think twice. The 5 cent charge was being
Cornelius City Council
Minutes–September 8, 2015                           Page 2 of 7
               used to facilitate a change to reusable bags. In this instance, businesses would charge
               and retain the 5 cent fee.

               Mr. Hayes added the purpose of the charge was also an attempt to recognize that paper
               bags were not particularly good for the environment either. Paper bags take more
               energy to produce, must be transported, and take up more space in the trash and
               landfills. The concept of moving to reusable bags as a society would probably not
               happen in his lifetime, but if people were allowed to have paper bags, they would just
               continue using them, which was another reason for the charge.

               Mayor Dalin said he was trying to understand the desire to legislate the amount rather
               than leave it to free enterprise and let businesses determine whether they could get
               away with charging the customers that amount or not.

               Discussion continued about the reuse of single-use plastic bags compared to plastic
               garbage bags, which required more petroleum to make and were more expensive, and
               statistics showing that reusing plastic bags was not as prevalent as those in the plastics
               industry believe. Though Seattle had banned plastic bags, a Seattle resident at the public
               forum shared that plastic bags are still quite ubiquitous in Seattle. The dangers of
               reusable bags not being washed regularly were also discussed, as well as issues with the
               weight limits of paper bags.

               Mr. Hayes noted that with a Community Enhance Program (CEP) Grant they received for
               the City of Forest Grove and $5,000 of available funds in the budget, the Sustainability
               Commission had amassed enough funds to buy a reusable bag for each of Forest Grove's
               8,000 residents. While they had not made a final decision as to which specific bag they
               would buy, but would definitely choose a bag that was machine washable.

               Mayor Dalin thanked Ms. Cole and Mr. Hayes for their time and asked that the
               Sustainability Commission keep the Council updated on how the issue in Forest Grove
               developed.

       A.      Resolution No. 2015-26: Non Represented and Management COLA



Cornelius City Council
Minutes–September 8, 2015                           Page 3 of 7
               City Manager Drake presented the Agenda Report, noting that traditionally the City
               Council performs an annual review of potential Cost Of Living Allowances (COLA) and
               normally followed a standard Cost of Living Allowance and/or an adjustment that was
               negotiated in labor contracts. Staff recommended the Council adopt that same 1.5%
               that was negotiated and adopted for non-represented and management employees. He
               clarified that City Council ultimately set its own salary levels. In his experience managing
               other cities, he found that many cities ask lay members of the Budget Committee to
               form a subcommittee and review the salaries of the Council and the mayor for the sake
               of transparency and to allay any concerns that the elected officials were not padding
               their own pockets. He recommended that lay members of the Budget Committee form a
               working group to examine the salaries and see how the City Councilors and the mayor
               compared with their peers, adding Council had the authority to ask a third-party to
               review the compensation levels. He noted that the countless hours Council spent
               representing the City at various regional meetings, local groups, etc. should also be
               considered. He recalled that the City of Tualatin gave their Council and mayor a
               discount on utility bills as compensation for time spent. He asked the Council to
               consider the issue and possibly instruct Staff to take action or form a committee at the
               next meeting.

A motion was made by Councilor Orozco to approve Resolution No. 2015-26, A RESOLUTION OF THE
CORNELIUS CITY COUNCIL RELATED TO COMPENSATION FOR COST OF LIVING INCREASES FOR NON
REPRESENTED AND MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES and this action takes effect July 1st, 2015, seconded
by Council Crowder. Motion carried 4-0. Ayes: Councilor Heinrich, Councilor Crowder, Councilor
Orozco, and Mayor Dalin.

               Following a brief discussion, Council agreed to have City Manager Drake compile a list of
               Council member compensation in 10 to 20 comparable cities to see how Cornelius
               ranked. The Council would decide whether to take further action and have the Budget
               Committee review the information when dealing with the budget.

       B.      Resolution No. 2015-27: Authorization to Apply for CDBG Funding

               City Engineer Keyes presented the Agenda Report, noting Staff was not sure the top
               sidewalk improvement on Dogwood from 14th to 20th Ave qualified for Community
               Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding. If the CDBG Staff determined that the project
               did not qualify, Staff would apply for Heather Street, Harleman Park, and Ginger Street
               from 10th to 12th Ave. If the Dogwood project did qualify, they would proceed with the
               Dogwood and Heather Streets’ improvements, but exclude Ginger Street.

               Mayor Dalin explained many mayors in the region have become very enthusiastic about
               the Safe Routes to School Program and were looking at that as a primary focus area for
               such grant money. He asked if different streets would be involved if the focus was on
               Safe Routes to School. City Engineer Keyes explained the CDBG used schools as a
               criterion for scoring. Heather Street was near Echo Shaw School, putting it in good
Cornelius City Council
Minutes–September 8, 2015                            Page 4 of 7
               shape. The Dogwood project went right up to where Head Start built sidewalks, and the
               City built sidewalks from 12th to Dogwood from the other direction. Ginger Street
               connected to collector streets that lead to Echo Shaw as well. All three projects were
               probably the best the City could have for Safe Routes to Schools.

A motion was made by Councilor Orozco to approve Resolution No. 2015-27, AUTHORIZING THE CITY
OF CORNELIUS TO APPLY FOR CDBG FUNDING FOR SIDEWALK PROJECTS AND AUTHORIZING CITY
STAFF TO SIGN THE GRANT APPLICATIONS and this action takes effect immediately, seconded by
Councilor Crowder. Motion carried 4-0. Ayes: Councilor Heinrich, Councilor Crowder, Councilor Orozco,
and Mayor Dalin.

9.     REPORTS
       A.      City Council:
               Councilors Heinrich and Orozco had nothing to report.

               Councilor Crowder reported that a Policy Advisory Board meeting was held on August
               6th. The Board would meet on September 17th in Hillsboro, so he would see what
               resulted from that.

       B.      Mayor’s Report:
               Mayor Dalin reported that the Washington County Coordinating Committee (WCCC) met
               in late August, early September and the Joint Policy Budget Committee Transportation
               would meet on Thursday. He reported on the Region 1 ACT meeting, for which he was
               the Washington County representative. He noted the deadline to apply for State funds
               had been extended, so there was still time if the City wanted to apply for projects that
               would involve funds from the State Transportation Improvement Project System. He
               confirmed there was not a lot of money available in the program, but wanted to ensure
               everyone was aware that the deadline had been extended. He would send information
               regarding the successes the Region 1 ACT had seen from the ITS investments made
               around Highways 217 and 226 to City Recorder‐Treasurer Roth so she could forward it
               to the Councilors.

       C.      City Manager Report:
               City Manager Drake noted that the October 3rd would mark the 10th Spanish-speaking
               town hall, adding the City would partner with Centro Cultural Washington County.
               Marni Kuyl, Washington County Health and Human Services Director, would provide an
               update about what has happened since July 1st, as the Latino community has been very
               concerned about the closure of some of the smaller health clinics in the County. The City
               would again partner with the Veterans of Foreign War and American Legion on for the
               Veterans Day celebration at 1:00 PM on November 11th. The County's Honor Guard
               would present the colors at the event and have a rifle salute, and once again, a bagpipe
               player would perform. The Second Annual Community Thanksgiving Dinner would be
               held November 21st at Cornelius Grade School from 4 PM to 7 PM, and volunteers would

Minutes–September 8, 2015                           Page 5 of 7
               be needed. The Fourth Annual Holiday Tree Lighting would be on Thursday, December
               3rd because Forest Grove schools would be closed on Friday. One principal was
               concerned that families might be dispersing on Friday since school would be closed that
               day. He noted the activities planned for the event.

                      CPD Personnel Updates
               Mr. Drake said Police Chief Gene Moss would provide the update and noted the
               handout in the meeting packet with pictures of the new officers. Chief Moss would also
               respond to the Council's concern regarding qualified Spanish speakers in the police
               department, and this was when there would be some annual turnover for the special
               assignment, so the Chief would discuss that as well.

               Police Chief Moss stated the police department recently begun the bidding process and
               six new deputies had bid for the specialty, one-year assignment. With the influx of the
               new deputies, combined with the deputies that had been in Cornelius for the last year,
               there would be three Spanish-speaking officers. One officer, a female deputy named
               Maribel Camas, was a Certified Spanish-speaker. The other two deputies were
               conversational and fully fluent, but had not tested for that certification.

               He responded to questions from Council, noting that no deputies were from the original
               Cornelius Police Department (CPD). Two former CPD officers, Deputy DeHaven and
               Deputy Harris, who were deputies in the department this past year, had chosen to bid
               to work in a different part of the County because although they loved Cornelius and
               intended to return, they wanted to experience working in other parts of the County and
               Chief Moss had encouraged them to do so. He confirmed Officer Cage had been with
               the CPD previously, and clarified that Maribel Camas, Nick Jones, Brian McLeod, Chris
               Plewik, Ryan Tack, and Ben Wiley were all new deputies, although Deputy Camas had
               worked in Cornelius for three weeks to fill in for an injured deputy. He announced the
               department had received quite a positive response regarding the new amber flashing

              to adopt comprehensive plan amendments to allow for annexation and development of
              properties included within the city’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) in 2014.

Background: Approximately 345 acres of property was added to the City’s UGB in 2014 as part of the Grand
            Bargain. Prior to allowing this properties to annex into the City and develop at urban densities
            the City must first adopt comprehensive plan amendments to guide the future zoning and
            identify how services can be provided to the properties. City staff spent a good portion of 2014
            working with consultants and community members to arrive that the recommendation that is
            before the Council.

Financial Implications: Financial implication associated with the amendments are addressed within the
             documents and include analysis of costs and how those costs will be provided for.

            15th, 2015 they reconvened and made a formal recommendation to the City Council to adopt
            ordinances 2015-06 and 2015-07 with the following amendment to staffs’ recommendation:

              To amend Exhibit N so that the recommendations sections reads as follows (underlined

                  2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot LIDA
                     facilities being used to meet subdivision stormwater quality or quantities requirements.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL
Effective April 1, 2014 approximately 345 acres of land were added to the City of Cornelius Urban
Growth Boundary (UGB) as a result of the legislature approving House Bill 4078, often referred
to as the “Grand Bargain”. The report and supporting documents are intended to support approval
of the City of Cornelius Ordinances 2015-07 (Exhibit A) and 2015-06 (Exhibit B) which seek to
adopt comprehensive plan designations for properties added to the UGB in 2014. In addition this
report and supporting documents identify the public services necessary to support the
urbanization of those properties added to the UGB. The report also supports the adoption of the
Council Creek Trail Master Plan as a component of the 2009 Parks Master Plan. Specific services
addressed within this report and proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan include
transportation (Exhibit G), water (Exhibit K), sanitary sewer (Exhibit L), stormwater (Exhibit N) and
parks and recreation (Exhibit H and M).

2014 NE URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY




The NE UGB is comprised of a mixture of lot sizes and existing development. The eastern,
western and northern (north of the railroad line) portion of the area are characterized by larger
lots with varying potential for additional residential development. The central portion of the area
is characterized by individual lots that are developed to very low density urban standards, these
areas are unlikely to redevelop in the future at a higher density. The area is currently served
with water by the City of Hillsboro, although much of the system is undersized and/or not

developed to City standards. The existing roadways provide for vehicle travel lanes, the streets
are not developed to City standards. All of this area is located north of State Highway 8 (TV
Highway) with the exception on one lot located south of the Highway. The City identified trails
and a future community park within the City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan (see Exhibit M).

2014 SE URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY




The SE UGB is comprised of a mixture of lot sizes and existing development. The area UGB
area is not currently served by water or sanitary sewer service. The only existing roadway within
the area is SW 345th Avenue which serves as the eastern border for the new UGB. The City has
three (3) collector roadways that are stubbed to the new UGB. These roadways are S. 20th
Avenue, S. 26th Avenue, and S. Dogwood Street. South Alpine Street also stubs into the SE
UGB and is designated a local street. Most of this area is located below the existing sanitary
sewer collection system within the City. The City identified trails and a future community park
within the City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan (see Exhibit M).

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
The City worked closely with Harper Houf Peterson Righellis (HHPR) to design and implement
the public engagement process for the project. The process included three (3) basic approaches
to gathering information and engaging the community in the process. The first was a series of
stakeholder surveys that were conducted with residents, property owners and service providers
within the 2014 UGB area. The second approach was a community survey that was available
online and as a hardcopy. The City hosted three (3) neighborhood meetings during the process
to share information and solicit feedback. The City also appointed a Technical Advisory
Committee (TAC) to assist staff with reviewing information and forming the recommendation that
is contained within this report. More detailed information is available below about each of the
processes. All of the comments received by the City throughout the process (as of 10-01-15) are
included as Exhibit C of this report. The City also hosted a webpage that provided information
about the process, upcoming meetings, and provided draft exhibits and reports for stakeholders
to access. Notices for public meetings were posted at City Hall, the Public Works Building, and
within the Forest Grove News Times. Articles were included about the meetings and survey within
the Cornelius Gazette, a monthly paper distributed to residents in English and Spanish with their
water bills. Notice of meetings was also provided on the City’s reader board attached to the east
side of the Cornelius Council Chambers along N. Adair Street. Staff also reached out to the
Oregonian and Forest Grove News Times to encourage the papers to write articles about the
meetings. Throughout the process the City maintained a mailing list of interested parties and
provided mailed notice regarding meeting content, times and dates.

STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS
City staff conducted face to face interviews with property owners and service providers within both
the NE and SE UGB areas. The goal of these interviews was to provide a forum for the City to
collect information first hand from the residents, property owners and service providers. Staff
spoke with Forest Grove School District, Hillsboro School District, the Oregon Department of
Transportation, Clean Water Services, Metro, Washington County, Centro Cultural, as well as
several property owners in the NE and SE UGB areas.

COMMUNITY SURVEY
HHPR prepared a community survey designed to solicit feedback from the community. The survey
was available on-line, interested parties were mailed notice of the survey and opportunity was
provided for people to fill out a hardcopy if they were unable to gain access to the internet. The
survey was completed by 46 people, 28 of the respondents self-identified as being from the NE
UGB, 6 self-identified as being from the SE UGB area, and 7 declined to disclose. This is not a
statistically valid survey, it was utilized as another forum to provide the community the opportunity
to provide input into the process, especially for those who were not able to make the neighborhood
meetings. A summary of the responses is included as Exhibit D to this report.

In general the respondents from the NE area valued new parks, walking paths and biking paths
less than those in SE. Approximately 2/3rds of the respondents did not want additional
commercial services and most of the respondents favored a pattern of residential development
utilizing larger lots with less common open space.

TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE
The City formed a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to assist with review of the technical
studies. The TAC was comprised of City Staff, a Planning Commission member, property owners
from both the NE and SE UGB as well as professional staff from Clean Water Services (CWS),

Metro, Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Washington County. All meetings were
open to the public and notice was mailed to interested parties, citizens were in attendance at all
the meetings listening to the discussion.

The first TAC meeting was held on February 25, 2015. At the meeting the consultant team
presented information about existing conditions, initial technical findings regarding the sanitary
sewer system, a summary of information received from the stakeholder interviews and information
received from the first neighborhood meeting. The intent of the meeting was to discuss the
opportunities and constraints and to solicit guidance in the development of preliminary
recommendations.

The second TAC meeting was held on April 23, 2015. At the meeting the consultant team
summarized the feedback received at the second neighborhood meeting and presented
preliminary recommendations for comprehensive plan map amendments. The intent of the
meeting was to solicit input to refine the recommendations for the comprehensive plan map
amendments.

The third TAC meeting was held on June 17, 2015. At the meeting the consultant team presented
the draft findings from the technical memorandums as well as the proposed comprehensive plan
map amendments. The intent of the meeting was to solicit input and identify any revisions that
may be necessary prior to public hearings and adoption.

NEIGHBORHOOD REVIEW MEETING #1
The first Neighborhood Meeting was held on January 8, 2015. The goal of the meeting was to
provide a forum for the community to share information, ask questions and voice concerns about
the planning process. Staff began the meeting by providing an overview of the process that was
utilized to add lands to the UGB in 2014. Staff detailed the process and expected timeline for the
project and provided information about how stakeholders could be involved in the process moving
forward. Staff facilitated an exercise to identify opportunities and constraints that would be used
to guide the process (Exhibit E). Staff provided an opportunity for community members to ask
questions. Approximately 71 people attended the meeting based on signatures collected on the
sign in sheets.

NEIGHBORHOOD REVIEW MEETING #2
The second Neighborhood Meeting was held on March 18, 2015. The goal of the meeting was to
provide a forum for the community to finalize the opportunities and constraints for the planning
project. At the meeting the consultant team and city staff provided a summary of the stakeholder
interviews, the first TAC meeting as well as the results of the community survey. At the meeting
an overview of each area was provided including information about what potential zoning and
associated comprehensive plan designations could be applied. Specific information was also
provided about existing planned improvements within the City’s parks master plan and
transportation system plan. DKS provided an overview of the existing conditions for the
transportation system. Summary notes from the meeting are included as Exhibit F. Approximately
51 people attended the meeting based on signatures collected on the sign in sheets.

NEIGHBORHOOD REVIEW MEETING #3
The third Neighborhood Meeting was held on May 20, 2015. The goal of the meeting was to
provide a forum for the community to review the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, ask
questions and provide feedback about the amendments. People were encouraged to submit

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MAP DESIGNATIONS (LAND USE)
The City is proposing to adopt comprehensive plan map designations for the properties that were
added to the UGB in 2014. The adoption of the comprehensive plan designations will not directly
affect the properties within the 2014 UGB at this time as those properties are still located within
Washington County’s jurisdiction. The zoning and corresponding rules and regulations that
currently exist on the properties as administered by Washington County will remain until those
properties are annexed into the City of Cornelius. The proposed comprehensive plan map land
use designations will guide how the properties will be zoned upon annexation to the City. Since
some of the comprehensive plan map designations can be implemented by more than one zone
Exhibit I and Exhibit J attached to this report include the proposed comprehensive plan map
designations and corresponding zoning to be applied when the properties are annexed.

2014 NE UGB
The 2014 NE UGB is proposed to be designated primarily residential on the comprehensive plan
map, the one exception is a parcel of land that is located south of the TV Highway just east of the
Coastal Farms store, this parcel is proposed to be designated commercial and will be zoned
Highway Commercial (C-2) when it is annexed into the City. The existing manufactured home
park along the western edge of the 2014 NE UGB is proposed to be designated Medium-density
Residential and will be zoned Manufactured Home Park (MHP) upon annexation to reflect the
existing use of the property. The remaining land within the 2014 NE UGB is proposed to
designated Low-density Residential and will be zoned either R-7 or R-10 as detailed within Exhibit
I.

2014 SE UGB
The 2014 SE UGB is proposed to be designated a mix of Low- and Medium-density Residential
on the comprehensive plan map. Low-density Residential is proposed to be designated along the
existing City Limits and along SW 345th Avenue for a width of 150 feet. This area would be zoned
R-7 upon annexation. The intent of this zoning is to match the existing development pattern within
the City and to provide a transition of density from the new 2014 SE UGB to the existing farmland
to east of SW 345th Avenue. The remaining land within the 2014 SE UGB is proposed to be
designated Medium-density Residential and will be zoned A-2 which is the City’s multi-family
zone. It is important to note that the A-2 zone permits a range of housing types beyond multi-
family including attached single family and detached single family development. See Exhibit J for
more detail and the location and extent of the proposed comprehensive plan designations.

UTILITIES FOR 2014 URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY
In order to allow for annexation of lands added to the UGB in 2014, the City must identify how
these properties can address stormwater requirements, be served with sanitary sewer service,
water service, and how properties are accessed and what public improvements are necessary to
support development.

SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM
CWS operates the sanitary sewer treatment plants within Washington County. Based on
coordination with CWS there is adequate capacity within their treatment and regional
conveyance facilities to accommodate the projected growth of the NE and SE UGB areas.
HHPR prepared a technical memorandum (Exhibits L) identifying the improvements to the local
conveyance system that will be necessary to support the development of the NE and SE UGB
areas. The City is seeking to amend the Cornelius Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (Appendices H
of the Cornelius Comprehensive Plan). Each of the improvements identified as necessary are
summarized below and detailed within Exhibit L.


NE UGB Sanitary Sewer
The NE UGB can be served with sanitary sewer service via the extension of the existing gravity
sewer system that is located to the north and south of the area. The conceptual layout set forth
in Exhibit L identifies four (4) sewer sub-basins that would convey the wastewater to the existing
sanitary line that services the mobile home park or the Council Creek Trunk Sewer which is
located north of the UGB. Detailed information concerning the proposed flows and capacity of
existing facilities is provided within the technical memorandum included within Exhibit L.

SE UGB Sanitary Sewer
A portion of the SE area located along the western edge can be served with sanitary sewer via
the extension of the existing gravity sewer system that is located within S. Ginger Street. The
majority of the SE UGB will require the construction of a pump station and force main
(pressurized sanitary sewer line) to provide sanitary sewer service. The point of connection to
the existing system will be at S. 20th Avenue and S. Ginger Street. Approximately 3,005 linear
feet of existing sanitary sewer line will need to be increased in size in order to provide sanitary
sewer service for the full build out of the SE UGB. Detailed information concerning the proposed
flows and capacity of existing facilities is provided within the technical memorandum included
within Exhibit L.

WATER SYSTEM
The City of Cornelius purchases bulk water from the City of Hillsboro and operates and
maintains a water distribution system within City Limits. There is a 72” water main that is located
within the TV Highway that provides water to the City. The City currently operates a 2 million
gallon storage reservoir within the City and is in the process of designing and constructing an
Aquifer Storage and Recharge (ASR) system that will allow the City to store approximately 50
million gallons of water. The water supply and storage system is adequate to provide for the
development of the 2014 UGB. More detailed information concerning the water system is
provided in a technical memorandum included within Exhibit K. The proposed water distribution
system is described in more detail below for each of the two areas.

NE UGB Water
The NE UGB currently is served with municipal water service by the City of Hillsboro, this
system was in place prior to the establishment of the City of Cornelius UGB. The existing
system does not meet City standards, many of the pipes are undersized and not constructed to
City standards. This area of the UGB will continue to be served by the City of Hillsboro. As
properties are annexed into the City and developed, existing distribution lines will be required to
be improved to meet City standards. The City will only accept lines and assume responsibility
for maintenance when the lines are brought up to City standards. The existing lines within NW
341st Avenue will be replaced with a 12 inch line. The remaining lines within NW 338th, 336th,
and 334th will be replaced with 8 inch lines. More detailed information concerning the water
system is provided in technical memorandum included within Exhibit K.

SE UGB Water
There is no water system that currently serves the SE UGB, however, there are existing water
lines within S. 20th Ave., S. 26th Ave, S Dogwood St., and S. Alpine St. The proposed water
system to serve the SE UGB will be extended from this existing system within the new
roadways that will provide vehicular access to the SE UGB. All lines within the SE UGB will be
designed and constructed to City standards, a minimum of 8 inch in size. New lines proposed to
be constructed within Collector roadways will be required to be 12 inches in size. More detailed
information concerning the water system is provided in the technical memorandum included
within Exhibit K.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
Staff is proposing amendments to the Transportation System Plan (TSP) in order to ensure the
existing and planned transportation system is adequate to meet the anticipated development of
the NE and SE UGB’s. The City contracted with DKS and Associates, a transportation engineering
and planning consultant to assist with analyzing the transportation system and potential impacts
associated with development of the additional land added to the City’s UGB in 2014. The graphic
below shows the six (6) intersections that were studied as part of the analysis. DKS worked closely
with City staff, ODOT staff and County staff to scope the proposed transportation analysis which
is included within Exhibit G.




SE UGB Transportation System
The graphic above depicts the additional improvements necessary (beyond those projects
identified within the City’s TSP) to support the build out of the SE UGB. Specifically the
proposed collectors are shown depicted as dashed lines. During the planning process City staff
expressed concern regarding the timing of the S. 29th Avenue intersection and corridor
improvement. Based on the analysis conducted by DKS intended to alleviate staff’s concerns
and achieve livability goals, city staff is recommending that development connecting to S. 20th
Avenue should be limited to 130 residential units and development connecting to 26th Avenue
should be limited to 260 residential units prior to construction of the 29th Avenue connection to
Tualatin Valley Highway. If development constructs a roadway connection within the southeast
area between S. 20th and S. 26th Avenues, then a combined development limit of 390 residential
units could be applied. More detail concerning the transportation analysis is presented within
Exhibit G.

NE UGB Transportation System

The NE UGB is primarily developed with low density residential uses, there is an existing street
network within the area, however, streets are not improved to City standards. City staff and the
consultant team examined opportunities for proposing an east-west roadway to provide more

connectivity in the area. It was determined that this type of improvement was not necessary given
the relatively low density of residential development proposed within the area and the existing
residents desire to maintain their existing development pattern. The proposed commercially
designated parcel south of the TV Highway was analyzed using both the Metro Regional Travel
Demand Model as well as the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation approach
due to concerns raised by community members. Utilizing the ITE approach, the reasonable worst
case development expected to be constructed on the property may result in a volume to capacity
(v/c) ratio greater than the ODOT performance standard of 0.99 at the driveway intersection
on the highway. This estimated v/c ratio would be determined by the Transportation Planning
Rule to be a “significant effect”. The analysis completed by DKS notes the potential for localized
traffic impacts at the commercial development driveway and recommends the upcoming
Transportation System Plan update scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2016 look at options
to address access, capacity and safety needs along the TV Highway corridor. Based on how the
property develops, a number of solutions could be implemented to address this concern including
but not limited to the following:

            1. If the proposed development of the property warrants a signal and is approved by
               ODOT, one could be installed to mitigate the impact at the driveway.
            2. If the proposed development does not meet warrants for a signal, the proposed
               development could be limited to right-in/right-out access or a similar access
               management solution designed to mitigate the impacts.
            3. The proposed development could work with adjacent properties to provide for a
               frontage connection south of TV Highway and install a signal at the existing
               Coastal Farms driveway. This option would require ODOT approval and
               cooperation from Coastal Farms as well as the intervening property owner who
               has a driveway just to the west of the subject property.

Any development on the property that results in more than 200 vehicular trips per day will trigger
the need to complete a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) as part of the land use review process for
the City as detailed in 18.143.030 of the Cornelius City Code. Section 18.143.030(C) provides the
City Engineer additional discretion to require a TIA even when proposed development results in
less than 200 vehicle trips per day. In addition, the TV Highway is Oregon State Highway 8 which
is an ODOT facility. Development of the subject property will require the applicant to obtain
approval from ODOT prior to development, at which time ODOT can also require a TIA.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
The terrain in NE and SE UGB area is generally flat. The NE area largely slopes to the north
toward Council Creek. The only waterway in this area is a large wetland area that separates the
NE UGB expansion area from the current City boundary. This wetland area drains north toward
Council Creek. The only existing stormwater facilities in the NE UGB area are roadside and
trackside ditches along Baseline, the north-south streets traversing the area, and the railroad
north of Baseline.
The SE area primarily slopes to the south toward the Tualatin River. The only waterway in this
area is an agricultural ditch that starts where S. 26th Avenue turns into Webb Road and then
traverses in a south-southwest direction toward the Tualatin River. The stormwater facilities in the
SE UGB area are limited to the roadside ditches on SW 345th Avenue and railroad ditches along
the railroad south of Baseline.
As development occurs with these areas, the existing facilities are expected to be replaced with
facilities meeting current Clean Water Service (CWS) standards. While this approach is not
innovative, it has been used successfully for decades in urban Washington County to manage
stormwater runoff. The existing topography of the two UGB areas do not dictate the need to be
creative, thus the development of the UGB’s will be afforded flexibility in how the stormwater
systems are designed and constructed provided those facilities meet CWS standards. The only
variations from the CWS standards are:

    1. Prohibition on the use of proprietary treatment systems, e.g., Stormfilters, for treatment on
       parts of the system that the City must maintain in the future, i.e., facilities to be dedicated
       to the City.
    2. Unless required by CWS rules, prohibition on single-family residential lot Low Impact
       Development Approach (LIDA) facilities.

The reason for the prohibition on proprietary systems is the additional maintenance burden these
pose for the City at a time when stormwater maintenance funding is extremely limited. Likewise,
the single-family lot LIDA facilities require on-going City inspection and oversight.

PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
The 2009 City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan provided for new improvements within both the NE
and SE UGB prior to those lands being included within the UGB (see Exhibit M). The proposed
amendments to the Parks Master Plan include removing some proposed trails that are located
outside of the UGB, adopting the Council Creek Trail Master Plan, and reducing the size of a
planned park (see Exhibit M). The City of Cornelius has had plans for a trail along Council Creek
since the 2009 Parks Master Plan was established. The associated adoption of the Council Creek
Trail Master Plan (Exhibit H) will relocate the proposed trail from along the creek corridor to within
the existing railroad right-of-way that bisects the NE UGB. The Council Creek Trail Master Plan
also calls for a north-south trail connection to connect in with a planned trail system along the
Tualatin River. The Council Creek Trail Master Plan identifies the preferred alignment for the trail,
estimated costs and associated trailhead locations to provide access to the trail. This plan and
associated alignment was arrived at after a detailed public study was completed in conjunction
with the Cities of Banks, Forest Grove, and Hillsboro as well as Washington County. A complete
copy of the plan is available on the City’s web site, hard copies are available for review at the
planning department. A summary of the proposed changes to the parks master plan is included
within Exhibit A and Exhibit B.

NE UGB Parks and Open Space
The proposed amendments for the NE UGB include changing the proposed Community Park
(CP-1) to a Neighborhood Park (NP), this is proposed in light of the relatively low residential
density proposed within the NE UGB. Staff is also recommending removing the proposed
section of trail along Council Creek that is proposed on private property (see Exhibit M). This
proposed for two reasons:
            1. The property owners have clearly communicated their desire to not have the trail;
                 and
            2. The area where the trail is proposed is highly unlikely to ever be included within
                 the City’s UGB.

SE UGB Parks and Open Space
Within the SE UGB the proposed amendments to the Parks Master Plan are solely related to
adopting the Council Creek Trail Master Plan (Exhibit H). Specifically the proposed adoption
identifies an alignment for a trail connecting the Council Creek Trail to the planned trail network
proposed within the SE UGB and along the Tualatin River.

SCHOOLS
The City of Cornelius is within both the Forest Grove School District (FGSD) as well as the
Hillsboro School District (HSD). The vast majority of the SE UGB area is within the HSD with a
small portion of the western edge located within the FGSD. All of the NE UGB is located within
the HSD. Staff coordinated with both school districts during the planning process to determine if
there was need for additional land to support new facilities to accommodate the development of
the 2014 UGB.

The FGSD noted that they had adequate capacity within the existing facilities to accommodate
the expected increase from development of the SE UGB. The HSD owns a 41 acre property
located in the SE UGB which can be utilized to accommodate future facilities (see Exhibit J).

NATURAL RESOURCES
The City works closely with CWS to protect natural resources located within and adjacent the
UGB. Those areas that have or are reasonably likely to have Goal 5 resources have the Natural
Resource Overlay (NRO) applied at the time of annexation and are subject to the provisions of
Chapter 18.95 of the Cornelius City Code. Furthermore, the City works closely with CWS,
requiring applicants to obtain a Service Provider Letter (SPL) prior to deeming a development
application complete and initiating review. This process assures that Goal 5 resources are
identified as to their quantity, quality and location prior to development occurring. If there is the
need to impact a resource for a transportation facility or other need, this process assures that
any temporary or permanent impacts are quantified and mitigated.

The NE UGB is bounded to the north by the Council Creek and its associate floodplain and to
the west by a tributary of Council Creek. These areas are protected Goal 5 resources. The SE
area is bounded to the south by the Tualatin River and its associated floodplain, these are
protected Goal 5 resources. Prior to annexation property owners will be required to submit a
wetland determination completed by qualified professional in order to ascertain the potential
presence of wetlands. If potential wetland resources are identified during the annexation
process, prior to development of a site the applicant will be required to submit a wetland
delineation that has been concurred with by the Oregon Department of State Lands.

OREGON STATEWIDE PLANNING GOALS
Goal 1: Citizen Involvement
To develop a citizen involvement program that insures the opportunity for citizens to be involved
in all phases of the planning process.

Finding:        The City has an acknowledged comprehensive plan and municipal code that has
                been found to be in compliance with Goal 1. The City conducted extensive
                outreach throughout the planning process with the goal of engaging as much of
                the citizenry as possible. The City exceeded the state and local requirements for
                notice and made all meetings open to public review including the TAC meetings.
                The City is proposing to host public hearings at the planning commission and city
                council as part of the adoption of the proposed amendments. Based on the
                information contained within this report and facts and findings in support of the
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments the City has conducted the planning
                process in compliance with statewide planning goal 1.

Goal 2: Land Use Planning
To establish a land use planning process and policy framework as a basis for all decision and
actions related to use of land and to assure an adequate factual base of such decisions and
actions.

Finding:        The City has an acknowledged comprehensive plan and municipal code that has
                been found to be in compliance with Goal 2. The City has provided the proper
                notice as required by the comprehensive plan and Cornelius City Code. Affected
                governmental agencies have been engaged in the development of the
                comprehensive plan amendments and/or provided notice of the proposed
                amendments consistent with the intent of this goal. The proposed amendments
                do not seek any exceptions to Statewide Planning Goals. Based on the
                information contained within this report and facts and findings in support of the
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments the City has conducted the planning
                process in compliance with statewide planning goal 2.

Goal 3: Agricultural Lands
To preserve and maintain agricultural lands.

Finding:        No goal exception is requested or required to Goal 3. The lands that are the
                subject of the proposed comprehensive plan amendments were included within
                the City of Cornelius UGB in 2014 as a result of a legislative action. The
                proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan map took into account the
                existence of farm land adjacent to the UGB and proposed to use low density
                residential zones, natural resource areas and existing transportation facilities to
                buffer the adjacent farm lands from the urbanizable land within the UGB
                consistent with the intent of this goal. Based on the information contained within
                this report and facts and findings in support of the proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments the City has conducted the planning process in compliance with
                statewide planning goal 3.

Goal 4: Forest Lands
To conserve forest lands by maintaining the forest land base and to protect the state's forest
economy by making possible economically efficient forest practices that assure the continuous
growing and harvesting of forest tree species as the leading use on forest land consistent with
sound management of soil, air, water, and fish and wildlife resources and to provide for
recreational opportunities and agriculture.

Finding:        The proposed amendments do not impact existing forest land and are therefore
                consistent with statewide planning goal 4.

Goal 5: Natural Resources, Scenic and Historic Resources, and Open Space
To protect natural resources and conserve scenic and historic areas and open spaces.

Finding:        The proposed amendments concern the 345 acres that was added to the City’s
                UGB in 2014 including amending the comprehensive plan map to designate
                these properties appropriately for future development. The proposed
                amendments include changes to the City’s utility master plans, transportation
                system plan and parks master plan to identify improvements necessary to
                support the development of these new lands. The City has designated Council
                Creek, the Tualatin River and their associated tributaries as Goal 5 resources
                within the comprehensive plan and enacted a Natural Resource Overlay (NRO)
                zone to protect the resources. The City works closely with CWS to administer the
                natural resource protections within the community and there is a development
                process in place to ensure that these resources will be protected and when
                appropriate enhanced. The proposed ordinances (Exhibit A and B) dictate that
                prior to annexation wetland determination completed by a qualified professional
                in order to ascertain the potential presence of wetlands. If potential wetland
                resources are identified during the annexation process, prior to development of a
                site the applicant will be required to submit a wetland delineation that has been
                concurred with by the Oregon Department of State Lands.

                No scenic or historic resources were identified within the 2014 UGB planning
                process, accordingly no resources are proposed to be added to the City’s
                inventory. New parks are identified for development within the UGB and open
                space areas are planned for preservation within the parks master plan consistent
                with the intent of this goal. Based on the information contained within this report
                and facts and findings in support of the proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments the City has conducted the planning process in compliance with
                statewide planning goal 5.


Goal 6: Air, Water and Land Resources Quality
To maintain and improve the quality of the air, water and land resources of the state.

Finding:        The City has demonstrated how sanitary sewer and stormwater services can be
                provided to support development of the 2014 UGB. Council Creek, the Tualatin
                River and their associated tributaries are identified as Goal 5 resources within the
                comprehensive plan. Future development will need to comply with the provisions
                of the City’s Natural Resource Overlay (NRO) as well as the requirements

                                                                                         October 5, 2015
                administered in part by CWS. These process will assure that development that
                occurs within the 2014 UGB does not degrade the water quality of the adjacent
                resources, in fact CWS and NRO requirements will mandate improvements to the
                existing vegetated corridor associated with these resources resulting in a net
                increase in the quality of the resources consistent with the intent of this goal. The
                City’s TSP will guide development of lands within the UGB resulting in an
                interconnected transportation system that provides for all modes of travel,
                including increased pedestrian and bicycle connections and facilities. The
                comprehensive plan amendments and Cornelius City Code will result in efficient
                development of the land within the 2014 UGB reducing the need to extend the
                UGB in the future consistent with the intent of this goal. Based on the information
                contained within this report and fact and findings in support of the proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments the City has conducted the planning process
                in compliance with statewide planning goal 6.

Goal 7: Areas Subject to Natural Hazards
To protect people and property from natural hazards.

Finding:        The 2014 UGB was delineated in part based upon the Federal Emergency
                Management Agency (FEMA) mapped floodplains associated with Council
                Creek, the Tualatin River and their associated tributaries. The result is that those
                areas mapped within the 100 year floodplain for these resources have been left
                out of the UGB, thus not permitting future urban development within the
                floodplains, one of the areas subject to natural hazards within western
                Washington County. The City of Cornelius Comprehensive Plan, the Cornelius
                City Code, the International Building Code and the International Fire Code all
                work together to ensure that future development within the 2014 UGB will be
                designed, permitted and constructed consistent with statewide planning goal 7.

Goal 8: Recreational Needs
To satisfy the recreational needs of the citizens of the state and visitors and, where appropriate,
to provide for the siting of necessary recreational facilities including destination resorts.

Finding:        Both the NE 2014 UGB and SE 2014 UGB areas were considered when the City
                of Cornelius developed the 2009 City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan. The
                proposed amendments to the parks master plan seek to add the Council Creek
                Trail Master Plan resulting in a planned facility that will provide additional
                recreation opportunities for the immediate community as well visitors and guests.
                The proposed amendment to reduce the planned park from a Community Park to
                a Neighborhood Park within the NE UGB area reflects the low-density residential
                development that is proposed to occur within this area. The proposal to remove a
                planned aspirational pathway that is located outside of the UGB on private land
                reflects the fact that this area is unlikely to ever be included within the UGB as
                well as the fact the property owners do not want it there. The proposed
                amendments to the parks master plan better reflect the needs of the community
                and are therefore consistent with statewide planning goal 8.

Goal 9: Economic Development
To provide adequate opportunities throughout the state for a variety of economic activities vital
to the health, welfare, and prosperity of Oregon's citizens.

Finding:        The City is located within the Metro Regional Boundary and is therefore not
                required to comply with statewide planning goal 9. As a member of Metro, the
                entire housing and employment needs of the area are collectively examined and
                guided to the benefit of the region as a whole. As such the City does not have an
                acknowledged Economic Opportunity Analysis. The City is proposing to
                designate a parcel in the NE UGB south of the TV Highway as commercial. This
                site is situated adjacent existing commercial development, and it is of adequate
                size and configuration to permit highway commercial development. This property
                will provide the opportunity for future commercial development and
                corresponding employment consistent with the intent of this goal.

                Additional areas within the NE UGB north of the TV Highway were requested to
                be designated commercial by a group of property owners. This was analyzed
                during the planning process, City Staff ultimately decided that these areas were
                not appropriate for commercial designation for a variety of reasons: the City
                already has existing vacant commercial property within the downtown and along
                the TV Highway corridor; there are significant amounts of commercial land within
                the City that are currently underutilized such as the Grande Foods site and Fred
                Meyer site; and the NE UGB (north of the highway) is already parcelized and
                developed as low-density residential. The proposed amendments are consistent
                with statewide goal 9.

Goal 10: Housing
To provide for the housing needs of citizens of the state.

Finding:        Similar to goal 9, the City does not need to demonstrate compliance with
                statewide planning goal 10 as it is located within Metro. The vast majority of the
                land include within the 2014 UGB is proposed to be designated low- or medium-
                density residential, the only exception is the approximately 7 acre parcel located
                in the NE UGB south of the TV Highway that is proposed to be designated
                commercial due its location and size.

                Later on in this report are findings that detail how the proposed comprehensive
                plan amendments comply with Metropolitan Housing Rule, exceeding the
                minimum density dictated by the state of Oregon for the City of Cornelius. As
                noted previously the City has an adequate supply of commercially designated
                land within the community that is either vacant or underdeveloped. The City also
                has good supply of industrial land that is either vacant or underdeveloped. The
                majority of the existing industrial land is located within two distinct areas of the
                community. The first is located in the NW corner of the City, the second is
                located in the SE corner of the City. These areas are ideally situated within the
                community to take advantage of access to Highway 26 and avoid potential
                conflicts between industrial and non-industrial uses.

                The NE UGB is already committed to low-density residential development. While
                there are some larger parcels that could be developed with a commercial or

                                                                                         October 5, 2015
                industrial use, these parcels are either located too far from the highway corridor,
                oriented awkwardly and/or are surrounded by existing residential development.
                Accordingly the NE UGB is proposed to be designated primarily low-density
                residential. The existing manufactured home park is proposed to be designated
                medium-density residential to reflect the existing development and is proposed to
                be zone Manufactured Home Park upon annexation.

                The SE UGB is comprised mostly of vacant large lots that are used for
                agricultural purposes. This area is relatively flat and could be developed with
                commercial and/or industrial uses. The question is whether this area is
                appropriate for this type of development and whether the City needs additional
                industrial and/or commercial land. Staff concluded that the location of the SE
                UGB was not appropriate for commercial and industrial development due to its
                distance from the TV Highway and Highway 26 corridors. There was also
                concern regarding the compatibility with existing development within the City.
                The city currently has a limited amount of developable residential land and Staff
                determined the SE UGB area was most appropriately designated as residential.
                The proposed mixture of low- and medium-density residential provides
                opportunities for a range of housing options while still maintaining compatibility
                with adjacent urban development and rural farm practices. The proposed
                amendments provide for a range of housing development to meet the City’s
                needs consistent with the intent of statewide goal 10.

Goal 11: Public Facilities and Services
To plan and develop a timely, orderly and efficient arrangement of public facilities and services to
serve as a framework for urban and rural development.

Finding:        The proposed comprehensive plan amendments are intended to guide the future
                development of land added to the UGB in 2014. Statewide goal 11 mandates that
                Cities plan for public facilities and services necessary to support the intended
                development. The proposed water, sewer, storm and transportation related
                amendments were sized to accommodate the level of development anticipated
                from the proposed comprehensive plan amendments. The transportation system
                plan is proposed to be amended to identify improvements necessary to mitigate
                the impacts associated with the reasonably worst case development scenario.
                Likewise the parks, water and sanitary sewer master plans are proposed to be
                amended to include improvements that are necessary to support the full build out
                of the UGB. By identifying these improvements and associated costs the City can
                plan for the provision of these services including but not limited to updating the
                City’s corresponding system development charges (SDC’s) to assure that
                adequate revenue is collected to provide for the improvements needed within the
                UGB.

                Identifying the correct improvements and determining when the improvements will
                need to occur provides the City the ability to effectively manage future annexations
                and development requests and ensure that services are available in a timely
                manner. Knowing the ultimate sanitary sewer and or water improvement that is
                necessary for the full build out of the UGB also allows the City to provide services
                efficiently, reducing the need to replace facilities in the future to accommodate

                                                                                        October 5, 2015
                continued development. This process also provides the community the ability to
                understand the actual costs of providing the services to determine if alternative
                funding mechanisms such as supplemental SDC’s or tax increment financing are
                necessary to support service delivery.

                The proposed comprehensive plan amendments anticipate the level of
                development that could occur within the UGB given the proposed comprehensive
                plan designation and corresponding zoning upon annexation. The amendments
                identify improvements necessary to support the development of the UGB. The
                process provides the City, the development community and residents an
                understanding of what improvements will need to occur, as well as, when and how
                those improvements will occur. The proposed amendments to the comprehensive
                plan are consistent with consistent with statewide goal 11.

Goal 12: Transportation
To provide and encourage a safe, convenient and economic transportation system

Finding:        The City contracted with DKS and Associates to prepare a transportation analysis
                to determine the improvements necessary to provide for the development of the
                new lands added to the UGB in 2014. DKS analyzed the vehicular, pedestrian,
                bicyclist and transit system within their transportation analysis. The analysis
                contained with Exhibit G identifies specific improvements necessary to mitigate the
                effects of the full build out of the UGB as well as recommendations for how to
                manage the development of the UGB to minimize impacts on existing
                development. Within this report are detailed findings demonstrating how the
                proposed comprehensive plan and comprehensive plan map amendments comply
                with the applicable transportation requirements of the state (Transportation
                Planning Rule) as well as the region (Metro). The transportation system that will
                serve the NE UGB utilizes existing roadways to accommodate the projected
                development of the area. As properties are annexed and proposed for
                development frontage and corridor improvements will be required as part of the
                land use review process. No new transportation facilities are planned for outside
                of the existing UGB. The proposed amendments address the requirements of
                statewide planning goal 12.

Goal 13: Energy Conservation
To conserve energy.

Finding:        The intent of this goal is to promote development and utilization of land within the
                UGB that conserves energy. Many of the specific implementation measures are
                targeted at code requirements that implement the comprehensive plan, such as lot
                size, building height, setbacks, and access to light, wind and air. The City is not
                proposing to alter the Cornelius City Code which has been acknowledged to be
                consistent with goal 13. This goal can be considered as part of the decision on
                what comprehensive plan designation to apply within the UGB, balanced of course
                with the other statewide planning goals. The proposed designation within the SE
                and NE area were arrived at after balancing the desires of the community, the

                                                                                        October 5, 2015
                needs of the City and the requirements put in place by the state, region and the
                City.

                While the NE UGB could have been proposed to be designated a higher residential
                density, this would have been inconsistent with the existing development pattern,
                as proposed, the designations will allow for additional density while respecting the
                existing low density residential development pattern.

                The proposed designation within the SE area have been designed to respect
                existing development while also providing the opportunity for higher density
                consistent with the intent of this goal. Services for water, stormwater, and sanitary
                sewer will be designed and located to maximize the efficient delivery of these
                services thereby reducing the cost to construct and maintain resulting in less
                consumption of energy. Similarly the transportation system will be designed and
                constructed to provide for direct connections and minimize out-of-direction travel.
                New facilities for pedestrians and bicyclist will be incorporated as part of the design
                providing for non-motorized connections to the existing City Limits and transit stops
                along the TV Highway. Therefore the proposed comprehensive plan amendments
                are consistent with statewide planning goal 13.

Goal 14: Urbanization
To provide for an orderly and efficient transition from rural to urban land use, to accommodate
urban population and urban employment inside urban growth boundaries, to ensure efficient use
of land, and to provide for livable communities.

Finding:        The primary purpose of goal 14 is to establish and manage urban growth
                boundaries within the state of Oregon. The proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments do not result in the establishment of a new UGB, nor do the
                amendments propose to alter the City of Cornelius UGB. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments will result in applying comprehensive plan map
                designations to land that was included within the UGB in 2014. The proposed
                designations include commercial, low-density residential and medium-density
                residential.

                The majority of the NE UGB is already committed to urban level development as
                witnessed by the zoning and development pattern that exists. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments will allow for future development of the majority
                of this area as low-density residential, respecting the existing development pattern
                and the wishes of the citizens who reside there. One parcel located south TV
                Highway is proposed to be designated commercial to reflect the existing
                development pattern along the south side of the highway. One parcel located along
                the western edge of the area is proposed to be designated medium-density
                residential to reflect existing development which is a mobile home park, this
                property would be zoned Mobile Home Park (MHP) upon annexation.

                The majority of the SE area is currently undeveloped and is characterized by rural
                residential development on large lots and farming activities. The majority of this
                area is proposed to be designated medium-density residential, with two specific

                                                                                           October 5, 2015
                areas proposed to be designated low-density residential. Along the east of the SE
                UGB the low-density residential is proposed to serve as a buffer along with SW
                345th Avenue between existing farmlands to the east. Similar the proposed
                amendments identify a buffer of low-density residential along the southern and
                eastern boundary of the existing City Limits, this is to ensure that development
                adjacent the existing City Limits keeps in scale with existing development. The
                proposed land use pattern within the SE UGB allows for efficient use of the land
                consistent with the intent of this goal while also respecting existing farm practices
                and existing development within the City.

                The proposed amendments do not propose to establish or alter a UGB. The
                proposed amendments do identify and plan for the provision of urban services
                necessary to support development of the subject areas and allow for future
                annexation into the City. These amendments do propose to apply comprehensive
                plan designations and urban services that will result in efficient development, while
                at the same time respecting the transition of the UGB and the redevelopment of
                areas that are already committed to low density residential. The proposed
                amendments are therefore consistent with statewide planning goal 14.

Goal 15: Willamette River Greenway
To protect, conserve, enhance and maintain the natural, scenic, historical, agricultural, economic
and recreational qualities of lands along the Willamette River as the Willamette River Greenway.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located along the Willamette River. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments do impact the Willamette River Greenway,
                therefore, the goal 15 is not applicable to this review.

Goal 16: Estuarine Resources
To recognize and protect the unique environmental, economic, and social values of each estuary
and associated wetlands; and To protect, maintain, where appropriate develop, and where
appropriate restore the long-term environmental, economic, and social values, diversity and
benefits of Oregon's estuaries.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no estuarine resources
                associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, therefore, goal
                16 is not applicable to this review

Goal 17: Coastal Shorelands
To conserve, protect, where appropriate, develop and where appropriate restore the resources
and benefits of all coastal shorelands, recognizing their value for protection and maintenance of
water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, water-dependent uses, economic resources and recreation
and aesthetics. The management of these shoreland areas shall be compatible with the
characteristics of the adjacent coastal waters; and To reduce the hazard to human life and
property, and the adverse effects upon water quality and fish and wildlife habitat, resulting from
the use and enjoyment of Oregon’s coastal shorelands.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no coastal shorelands
                associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, therefore, goal
                17 is not applicable to this review

Goal 18: Beaches and Dunes
To conserve, protect, where appropriate develop, and where appropriate restore the resources
and benefits of coastal beach and dune areas; and to reduce the hazard to human life and
property from natural or man-induced actions associated with these areas.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no beach or dune
                resources associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments,
                therefore, goal 18 is not applicable to this review

Goal 19: Ocean Resources
To conserve marine resources and ecological functions for the purpose of providing long-term
ecological, economic, and social value and benefits to future generations.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is not located on the coast, there are no ocean resources
                associated with the proposed comprehensive plan amendments, therefore, goal
                19 is not applicable to this review.



METRO TITLE 11 ANALYSIS
3.07.1120 PLANNING FOR AREAS ADDED TO THE UGB
A. The county or city responsible for comprehensive planning of an area, as specified by the
intergovernmental agreement adopted pursuant to section 3.07.1110C(7) or the ordinance that
added the area to the UGB, shall adopt comprehensive plan provisions and land use regulations
for the area to address the requirements of subsection C by the date specified by the ordinance
or by section 3.07.1455B(4) of this chapter.

Finding:        The subject properties were added to the City of Cornelius Urban Growth
                Boundary (UGB) by the State of Oregon by House Bill 4078. The City is therefore
                responsible for the comprehensive planning of the area. The City is proposing to
                adopt amendments to the Cornelius Comprehensive Plan to provide guidance on
                how the properties can be developed and served upon annexation into the City.
                The proposed comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with this provision.

B. If the concept plan developed for the area pursuant to section 3.07.1110 assigns planning
responsibility to more than one city or county, the responsible local governments shall provide for
concurrent consideration and adoption of proposed comprehensive plan provisions unless the
ordinance adding the area to the UGB provides otherwise.

Finding:        There is no corresponding concept plan for the subject properties. As noted above
                the areas were added into the City’s UGB through a state legislative action (HB
                4078). The responsible local government is the City of Cornelius. The City of
                Cornelius is proposing specific comprehensive plan amendments to provide

                guidance on how the properties can be developed and served upon annexation
                into the City. The proposed comprehensive plan amendments are consistent with
                this provision.

C. Comprehensive plan provisions for the area shall include:
      1. Specific plan designation boundaries derived from and generally consistent with the
      boundaries of design type designations assigned by the Metro Council in the ordinance
      adding the area to the UGB;

Finding:        The two areas, referred to as the 2014 SE UGB and 2014 NE UGB were defined
                by Metro (see Exhibits I and J) after the passage of House Bill 4078. The City is
                proposing specific amendments to the comprehensive plan to guide future
                development of these areas. In addition, the City is also proposing to acknowledge
                the Council Creek Regional Trail Plan (Exhibit H) as a component of the 2009 City
                of Cornelius Parks Master Plan (component of the comprehensive plan). Both the
                CCRTP and 2014 UGB amendments are intended to guide future development
                within the City of Cornelius UGB consistent with the intent of this criterion.

        2. Provision for annexation to a city and to any necessary service districts prior to, or
        simultaneously with, application of city land use regulations intended to comply with this
        subsection;

Finding:        Once the proposed amendments are completed and in effect, the City can process
                annexations from the 2014 UGB areas, provided each property meets the City’s
                annexation requirements detailed on Page 16 of the Comprehensive Plan. Upon
                annexation the City will apply the appropriate zoning, including the Natural
                Resource Overlay (NRO) zone for those properties that adjacent Council Creek,
                the Tualatin River and the associated tributaries.

        3. Provisions that ensure zoned capacity for the number and types of housing units, if any,
        specified by the Metro Council pursuant to section 3.07.1455B(2) of this chapter;

Finding:        Section 3.07.1455B(2) relates to a conditions of approval that are typically placed
                on properties during “concept planning” prior to inclusion within the UGB. As noted
                above the properties were added to the UGB through a legislative process at the
                state level. No specific requirements or conditions of approval were placed on the
                UGB expansion at that time. No specific conditions of approval were placed on the
                UGB expansion by the Metro Council. Therefore the criterion identified above is
                not applicable to this review.

        4. Provision for affordable housing consistent with Title 7 of this chapter if the
        comprehensive plan authorizes housing in any part of the area.

Finding:        Detailed findings demonstrating conformance with Title 7 are provided below with
                this report.

        5. Provision for the amount of land and improvements needed, if any, for public school
        facilities sufficient to serve the area added to the UGB in coordination with affected school
        districts. This Effective 09/10/14 3.07 - 64 of 129 requirement includes consideration of
        any school facility plan prepared in accordance with ORS 195.110;

Finding:        The City is served by two school districts, the Hillsboro School District (HSD) and
                Forest Grove School District (FGSD). The City worked closely with both districts
                to determine if there was the need for additional school property at the beginning
                of the planning process. The majority of the area added to the UGB in 2014 is
                within the HSD, with a small portion in the southwest area of the UGB located
                within the FGSD.

                The HSD owns approximately 41 acres within the 2014 SE UGB area. This area
                is of sufficient size to accommodate a High School, Middle School, Elementary
                School or a combination Middle/Elementary School. Based on interviews with HSD
                staff, the district does not need additional land to support the anticipated growth.
                The FGSD has existing capacity within their district to be able serve their portion
                of the 2014 SE UGB. Schools are permitted as a conditional use in the R-7, R-10,
                and A-2 zones. The proposed amendments account for the future needs of the
                HSD and FGSD consistent with this criterion.

        6. Provision for the amount of land and improvements needed, if any, for public park
        facilities sufficient to serve the area added to the UGB in coordination with affected park
        providers.

Finding:        The City of Cornelius is the park provider for our UGB. The proposed amendments
                to the UGB include revisions to the 2009 City of Cornelius Parks Master Plan. The
                revised plan calls for a Neighborhood Park in the 2014 NE UGB as well as several
                linear open space areas that will provide connections to the Tualatin River and
                Council Creek corridors. The proposed amendments also provide for the formal
                acknowledgement of the Council Creek Region Trail Plan as a component of the
                comprehensive plan.

        7. A conceptual street plan that identifies internal street connections and connections to
        adjacent urban areas to improve local access and improve the integrity of the regional
        street system. For areas that allow residential or mixed-use development, the plan shall
        meet the standards for street connections in the Regional Transportation Functional Plan;

Finding:        The majority of the area brought into the UGB in 2014 is intended for residential
                development. The City contracted with DKS and Associates to analyze the
                transportation system. Exhibit G is a technical memorandum that identifies the
                approximate location of new collector roadways and intersection improvements
                that will be necessary to support the development of both areas added to the UGB,
                this serves as the conceptual street plan required. The design and location of local
                streets will be determined at the time of development. City Staff will require designs
                that are consistent with Title 17 (Subdivision Ordinance) and 18.143 of the
                Cornelius City Code which mandate compliance with Title 1 of Section 3.08.110 of
                the Regional Transportation Functional Plan.

                Specifically all sidewalks constructed within the new UGB areas will be a minimum
                of five (5) feet in width. The City does permit and encourage local streets to be
                constructed with pavement widths less than 28 feet in width. City standards require
                street trees located within a landscape planter area that is a minimum of five (5)
                feet in width. City standards permit the use of traffic calming devices such as speed
                bumps, curb extensions and chicanes. At the time of development these standards
                will be assured consistent this requirement.

        8. Provision for the financing of local and state public facilities and services; and

Finding:        The proposed comprehensive plan amendments include revisions to the City’s
                parks, utility and transportation master plans to support the proposed
                comprehensive plan map designations within Exhibit I and J. For each new facility
                required to serve the new UGB appropriate funding has been identified. Due to the
                size and scale of the infrastructure necessary to support development of the 2014
                UGB no supplemental SDC’s or alternative funding mechanisms are necessary. A
                combination of existing SDC’s and development exactions will suffice to ensure
                that improvements can be completed when they are needed. The City has been
                working diligently with CWS and Washington County to ensure that key
                infrastructure improvements are identified within the appropriate capital
                improvement plans to ensure these improvements are SDC creditable. The two
                largest improvements; 1.) The sanitary sewer pump station for the SE UGB, and
                2.) The 29th Street intersection and corridor extension are both SDC creditable. In
                fact the 29th Street project has been identified within the City’s TSP since 2005.
                The remaining improvements including the extension of the sanitary system,
                extension of the water system, development of the stormwater system, and
                development of the parks system will be completed through a combination of
                development exactions and utilizing funds collected through SDC’s. The proposed
                comprehensive plan amendments have considered the need for financing and
                determined adequate measures exist to provide for the identified services
                consistent with this requirement.

        9. A strategy for protection of the capacity and function of state highway interchanges,
        including existing and planned interchanges and planned improvements to interchanges.

Finding:        The City does not have any state highway interchanges or planned interchanges
                located within the UGB. Therefore the proposed amendments to the
                comprehensive plan are consistent with this requirement.

D. The county or city responsible for comprehensive planning of an area shall submit to Metro a
determination of the residential capacity of any area zoned to allow dwelling units, using the
method in section 3.07.120, within 30 days after adoption of new land use regulations for the area.
Finding:        The City shall comply with this requirement, detailed findings demonstrating
                compliance with the applicable portions of Title 7 are set forth below.

TITLE 7: HOUSING CHOICE
3.07.730 REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND IMPLEMENTING
ORDINANCE CHANGES
Cities and counties within the Metro region shall ensure that their comprehensive plans and
implementing ordinances:
        A. Include strategies to ensure a diverse range of housing types within their jurisdictional
        boundaries.

Finding:        The proposed amendments do not include changes to the implementing
                ordinance. The Cornelius City Code has previously been acknowledged by the
                state of Oregon. The City provides the opportunity for a diverse range of housing
                within each of our residential zones. The proposed comprehensive plan
                amendments result in a mixture of low- and medium-density residential land that
                can accommodate wide range of housing options including apartments, attached
                single family housing, accessory dwellings, and detached single family housing.
                The City’s Planned Unit Development ordinance permits flexibility in housing type,
                lot size, setbacks and many other development standards. The City recently
                approved a nonprofit low-income housing tax exemption (Section 3.35 of the
                Cornelius City Code) to encourage the development of affordable housing within
                the community. The minimum density requirements of the implementing zones will
                also assure a diverse range of housing types is provided within the community.
                The proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan do not seek to alter any of
                these strategies, rather the amendments seek to allow for the development of
                additional residential development within the community via the adoption of
                amendments to the utility master plans and the comprehensive plan map
                consistent with this section of Title 7.

        B. Include in their plans actions and implementation measures designed to maintain the
        existing supply of affordable housing as well as increase the opportunities for new
        dispersed affordable housing within their boundaries.

Finding:        The City is not proposing to amend any of the implementing ordinances for the
                comprehensive plan. However, the City did adopt a nonprofit corporation low-
                income housing tax exemption (Chapter 3.35 of the Cornelius City Code) in an
                effort to increase the provision of affordable housing within the community. The
                City is proposing to designate a mix of low- and medium-density residential land
                on the comprehensive plan map that would provide the opportunity for additional
                affordable housing to be developed within the community.

                All of the City’s residential zones permit the development of accessory dwellings.
                The SE UGB in particular will have a significant amount of medium-density
                designated land that will ultimately be zoned A-2, Multi-family upon annexation into
                the City. The A-2 zone allows for a wide range of housing types including
                apartments, townhomes, attached single family and detached single family homes.
                The minimum lot size for a single family detached home in the A-2 is 3,100 sq. ft.
                and it is 3,000 sq. ft. for attached products. The smaller lot size allows for a more
                affordable home by reducing the size of the lot of, thereby reducing the cost of the
                home. The R-7 zone allows for attached and detached single family homes.

                The proposed amendments would not limit or reduce the City’s ability to maintain
                and/or increase the affordable housing supplied within the community. In contrast
                the proposed amendments would provide additional land where a variety of new
                housing could be constructed consistent with the intent of this section of Title 7.

        C. Include plan policies, actions, and implementation measures aimed at increasing
        opportunities for households of all income levels to live within their individual jurisdictions
        in affordable housing.

Finding:        As detailed above the City is not proposing to remove and/or alter any policies or
                implementing measures. The City has measures in place to promote the provision
                of affordable housing within the community. The City is lacking land available for
                development of affordable housing. The proposed amendments to the
                comprehensive plan would result in plan designations that would be supportive of
                this section of Title 7 by providing additional land within the City’s residential
                inventory that could be developed with affordable housing opportunities in the
                future.



METROPOLITAN HOUSING RULE
660-007-0035

MINIMUM RESIDENTIAL DENSITY ALLOCATION FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION
The following standards shall apply to those jurisdictions which provide the opportunity for at least
50 percent of new residential units to be attached single family housing or multiple family housing:
        (1) The Cities of Cornelius, Durham, Fairview, Happy Valley and Sherwood must provide
        for an overall density of six or more dwelling units per net buildable acre. These are
        relatively small cities with some growth potential (i.e. with a regionally coordinated
        population projection of less than 8,000 persons for the active planning area).

Finding:        The City of Cornelius allows for attached single family housing in the R-10, R-7
                and A-2 zones providing the opportunity for approximately 95 percent of new
                residential units within the 2014 UGB to be attached single family or multiple family.
                The only zone that precludes attached single family housing is the Manufactured
                Home Park (MHP) zone. Therefore, the City of Cornelius minimum overall density
                shall be six dwelling units per net developable acre. The Cornelius City Code
                and/or Comprehensive Plan define the net buildable acres for each zone. The City
                is proposing to designate 173 acres of low-density residential (R-7 and R-10) and
                186 acres of medium-density residential (A-2 and MHP) resulting in an average
                minimum density of 7.36 dwelling units per net acre for the planning areas. The
                proposed comprehensive plan amendments exceed the standard.

Finding:            In support of the proposed comprehensive plan map amendments the City
                    engaged DKS and Associates to analyze the transportation system and provide a
                    formal recommendation to ensure that the proposed comprehensive plan map
                    amendments (Exhibits I and J) comply with the Oregon Transportation Planning
                    Rule (OAR 660-012-0060). DKS coordinated with ODOT and Washington County
                    prior to conducting the study to identify the appropriate scope of work to
                    complete this review. DKS’s analysis is included within Exhibit G of this report.
                    The traffic analysis completed for the proposed Cornelius UGB expansion areas
                    found the potential vehicle trip increase would not significantly impact the
                    surrounding transportation system and would satisfy the requirements of OAR
                    660-012-0060. No capacity improvements to existing facilities beyond those
                    identified in the RTP and Cornelius TSP are required to support the UGB
                    expansion areas. DKS did suggest that further analysis of Tualatin Valley
                    Highway west of SW 345th Avenue should be included in the upcoming Cornelius
                    TSP update to identify specific projects to serve fronting property needs for
                    access, capacity and safety. City staff have included this recommendation within
                    the scope of work for the upcoming TSP update.

CORNELIUS COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN LAND USE PLANNING

Amending the Plan
It is the City's intent to give the citizens and affected governmental units’ ample opportunity to
review and comment on any proposed plan changes. There are several types of amendments
that may occur over time. They include:
         • Periodic Review, as required by state law, every 7-10 years.
         • Plan Text amendments, which alter the policies of the plan.
         • Plan Map amendments, which alter the land use designation and/or density of a specific
         property or group of properties.
         • Amendments may be major or minor in nature:
                 * Major amendments (Legislative) include land use changes that have widespread
                 and significant impact beyond the immediate area or an individual parcel. These
                 include quantitative changes producing large volumes of traffic; qualitative
                 changes in the character of the land use itself such as conversion of residential to
                 industrial use; or spatial changes that affect large areas or many different
                 ownerships. A complete rethinking of the plan and the needs of the public may be
                 necessary before major amendments are approved.
                 * Minor amendments (Quasi-judicial) have little significance beyond the immediate
                 area of the change. Their evaluation will be based on special studies or other
                 information which justifies the public need for the change.


Procedures
Amendments may be initiated by the City Council, Planning Commission, city staff, or a 11
property owner, or group of owners. The amendment shall be initiated through a formal application
process. All amendments shall include specific recommendations or requests from the applicant,
supported by factual documentation as to why the amendment is necessary and appropriate. A
staff report shall be prepared and presented to the Planning Commission.

Finding:        The City Council initiated the amendments that are the subject of this report.

Public hearings shall be held before any amendment is approved. There shall first be a review by
the Planning Commission, which may also include informal public meetings or workshops, but
shall conclude in a public hearing. The Commission shall make a formal recommendation to the
City Council. The City Council shall then also hold a public hearing before making a final decision
to amend the Plan. Any amendment shall be adopted by ordinance.

Finding:        The planning commission is scheduled to hold a public hearing on October 13th
                and the City Council is scheduled to host a public hearing in November. The
                proposed amendments are contained within Ordinance 2015-06 and 2015-07. The
                proposed amendments are consistent with this section of the comprehensive plan.

Notice of Amendments
For minor amendments (quasi-judicial) applying to individual parcels or small local areas a public
hearing on the proposed change will be held, and at least 20 working days of notice prior to the
hearing will be given to all owners, including the subject site, and within 250 feet of a specific
property boundary for which a change is proposed.

Finding:        The proposed package of amendments is not quasi-judicial, the amendments
                encompass approximately 345 acres and numerous property owners. The notice
                requirement detailed above is not applicable to this review.

For major amendments (legislative) applying to large areas or effecting general policies of the
plan notice shall be given to all property owners within the City limits by publication in a newspaper
of general circulation in the City. Such notice shall be provided, at least 20 days prior to the first
hearing.

Finding:        The City posted notice of the first hearing 21 days prior to the first hearing before
                the planning commission in the Forest Grove News Times. Notice was posted on
                September 23rd, 2015 for the October 13th, 2015 hearing. As detailed above the
                City also provided direct mailed notice to those interested parties who participated
                in the planning process. The proposed amendments exceed the minimum notice
                requirement set forth above.

For all amendments notice shall be provided to interested and effected public agencies, with
specific notice to METRO and DLCD, at least 45 days prior to the first hearing, as provided under
ORS 197.610 and OAR Chapter 660, Division 18.

Finding:        The City provided notice to affected agencies pursuant to ORS 197.610.


Criteria
The following criteria shall be used to establish whether or not a plan amendment or change is
justified. An amendment need not satisfy each and every one of the criteria, but the city must
conclude that at least some of the criteria have been reasonably addressed.

        • The fact that an applicant owns the land for which the change is being sought is not in
        itself sufficient justification for the change or amendment.

Finding:        The proposed comprehensive plan amendments were initiated by the City Council
                and not specifically proposed by an individual property owner.

        • The proposed change or amendment must meet a public need. Such need must be
        documented by appropriate facts and evidence and should extend from the statewide
        planning goals, METRO 2040, or the city own comprehensive plan.

                                                                                          October 5, 2015
Finding:        The public need that proposed amendments are meeting has been documented
                throughout this report. The proposed amendments are intended to guide the
                development of approximately 345 acres that was added to the City’s UGB in 2014.
                There is a lack of residential land available for development within the City without
                the proposed amendments, areas added to the UGB in 2014 will be unable to
                annex into the City and meet the demand for residential development within the
                community.

        • The amendment is necessary to conform with current state law or regional 12 policy,
        which requires local compliance.

Finding:        The amendments proposed are not necessary to comply with current state law or
                regional 12 policy. The amendments are necessary to provide guidance for the
                development of land that was added to the UGB in 2014. Failure to approve the
                amendments will prevent property located within the new UGB from being able to
                annex to the City and develop. There is a demonstrated need for the additional
                land to provide new housing opportunities for the community.

        • The amendment is necessary to implement the adopted vision for the community, or to
        respond to unanticipated local circumstances.

Finding:        The proposed amendments are necessary to allow for annexation and
                development of land added to the City’s UGB in 2014. The community has sought
                to include portions of these lands within UGB for some time, this desire is reflected
                in the City’s current TSP which identifies improvements within the SE UGB as well
                as the City’s parks master plan which identifies improvements within both the NE
                and SE UGB. Both of these plans were adopted and acknowledged as part of the
                City’s comprehensive plan reflecting the community’s vision for these areas.
                Without approval of the proposed comprehensive plan amendments the vision
                articulated within the plan cannot be realized. The amendments are also necessary
                to respond to an unanticipated local circumstance that resulted from addition of
                land to the City’s UGB in 2014 as approved by the state legislature and signed into
                law by the governor. The proposal is consistent with these criteria.

        • The proposed change or amendment must be in conformance with the unamended goals
        and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, as well as being consistent with state and
        regional policies.

Finding:        This report has documented how the proposed amendments are consistent with
                the statewide planning goals, the applicable provisions of the Metro’s policy, the
                applicable Oregon administrative rules as well as the applicable portions of the
                City’s comprehensive plan and the Cornelius City Code.

        • The amendment must meet the standards and requirements of the zone in which it is
        located, or proposed to be located.

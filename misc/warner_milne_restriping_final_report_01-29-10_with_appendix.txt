the relocation of the Warner Milne Road approach to Molalla Avenue in order to align opposite Fox
Lane. In addition, the curb-to-curb distance is being widened to accommodate three travel lanes (one
in either direction plus an eastbound turn lane) as well as bike lanes in either direction. This widened
cross section will extend approximately 350 feet from the intersection, at which point the bike lanes
will end and Warner Milne Road will narrow to the existing curb-to-curb distance. The construction
design plans show restriping a travel lane in either direction plus a center TWLTL along the rest of
Warner Milne Road up until approximately 190 feet from Beavercreek Road. The TWLTL striping
will then end and a westbound left turn lane for the signalized Warner Milne Road/Beavercreek Road
intersection will be provided. This plan is consistent with the previous Warner Milne Road striping.

Due to the current roadwork on Warner Milne Road, now is an opportune moment to decide whether
bike lanes should be provided instead of a TWLTL. One key reference for the city is the Oregon City
TSP, which indicates that bike lanes are required on minor arterials while center turn lanes are
optional.3 Therefore, because Warner Milne Road is classified as a minor arterial, bike lanes would
typically be a higher priority than a TWLTL.

A review of other minor arterials throughout the city also indicates that bike lanes are almost always
provided instead of TWLTLs.4 The following roadways are some examples (though in some
instances there are unimproved roadway sections where there are neither bike lanes nor TWLTLs):
    •    Warner Parrot Road (which becomes Warner Milne Road at Linn Avenue)
    •    South End Road
    •    Linn Avenue
    •    Holmes Lane
    •    Meyers Road
    •    Redland Road
    •    Washington Street

As mentioned previously, land uses along this section of Warner Milne Road are mixed use
employment, commercial, and high density residential. These land uses often attract bike trips as
residents travel between their homes and retail/employment centers. Therefore, bike lanes would
facilitate bike trips in the area. In addition, providing bike lanes adjacent to these land uses is
consistent with the Oregon City TSP objective to “provide a well-defined and accessible bicycle
network that links residential areas, major bicycle generators, employment centers, and the arterial
and collector roadway network with one another.”5

In addition, as Oregon City continues to improve the connectivity of its bike lane network, it will
encourage residents to use alternative transportation modes and contribute to a reduction in vehicle-
miles traveled (VMT). The City has a goal identified in its TSP6 to reduce per capita VMT by 10
percent between the years 2000 and 2020, and additional bike lanes can help the City move towards
this goal. Furthermore, providing bike facilities (such as bike lanes) is a proactive and

economical approach to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which will help Oregon City to
meet another TSP Goal, namely to “ensure the multi-modal transportation system preserves, protects,
and supports the environmental integrity of the Oregon City community.”7 Therefore, providing bike
lanes instead of a TWLTL is more consistent with multiple objectives of the Oregon City TSP.

There are also regional goals that should be addressed because Oregon City is within Metro’s
metropolitan planning boundaries. Metro is the federally mandated metropolitan planning
organization designated by the governor to develop an overall transportation plan and to allocate
federal funds for the region. In their 2035 Regional Transportation Plan,8 Metro has also identified
various objectives that are associated with providing an increased number of bike lanes:
       •    Objective 3.1: Travel Choices – Achieve modal targets for increased walking, bicycling,
            use of transit and shared ride and reduced reliance on the automobile and drive alone trips.
       •    Objective 3.2: Vehicle Miles of Travel – Reduce vehicle miles traveled per capita.
       •    Objective 6.2: Clean Air – Reduce transportation‐related vehicle emissions to improve air
            quality so that as growth occurs, the view of the Cascades and the Coast Range from within
            the region are maintained.
       •    Objective 7.1: Active Living – Provide safe, comfortable and convenient transportation
            options that support active living and physical activity to meet daily needs and access
            services.

If bike lanes were provided on Warner Milne Road instead of a TWLTL and no widening was
performed, the bike lanes would be required to end approximately 190 feet east of Beavercreek Road
to allow for the westbound left turn lane at the Warner Milne Road/Beavercreek Road intersection.
This would leave a gap in the bicycle lane network starting at this location and extending west to
Linn Avenue (where Warner Milne Road becomes Warner Parrot Road).

The main consideration for including a TWLTL instead of bike lanes is that this is what was
previously provided and current construction plans include the restriping of a TWLTL instead of bike
lanes. In addition, because certain operational and safety considerations (e.g., left-turn volumes,
capacity needs, and recent collisions) can increase the importance of having a TWLTL, these were
analyzed and are documented in this memorandum in order to assist City Staff in determining
whether a TWLTL on Warner Milne Road is more important than bike lanes.

Safety Research
Research was performed to document when bike lanes and/or a center two-way left-turn lane
(TWLTL) are appropriate and how they can benefit roadway users. How these considerations relate
to this segment of Warner Milne Road is discussed throughout this memorandum and overall
findings are provided in the final summary section.

Bike Lanes
Cyclists are important roadway users, and all roadways should be designed under the assumption that
they will be used by cyclists.9 In addition, because there are various methods that can be used to
accommodate bicyclists, community goals (typically developed and documented in conjunction with
transportation plans) are important in shaping how a bicycle network is developed.10 Therefore, the
Oregon City TSP is an important document to provide guidance for this decision.

Bicyclist safety is another important consideration when determining whether to install bike lanes.
One emphasis area that has been identified for reducing the number and of severity of bicycle-related
collisions is to provide safe roadway facilities for parallel travel. The most common method of doing
so is to provide bicycle lanes.11

In recent years, bicycle travel has also become a more important alternative mode of transportation in
the United States. A primary method that has been used to improve bicycle travel is to provide bike
lanes. In fact, it has been recommended that “special efforts . . . be made to assure that a high quality
network is provided with these lanes.”12 While there are no definite rules for determining when a
striped bike lane should be provided to accommodate bicycle traffic, two of the main considerations
that are typically used across the world are roadway traffic volumes and travel speed. The most
common thresholds are when there are more than 3,000 daily vehicles and/or vehicular travel speeds
are in excess of 25 mph.13 These thresholds are also documented in the Oregon City TSP.14

Center Two-Way Left-Turn Lanes (TWLTLs)
Though it is best to remove left-turning traffic from through lanes whenever practical, the degree of
importance of providing a turn lane is based on whether one is warranted. The two main warrant
considerations are high traffic volumes and identified safety concerns.15

Research data16 also support the finding that having a TWLTL has been shown to be advantageous
for the following reasons:
     •   There are less collisions, especially rear-ends; though, the greatest collision reduction
         benefits are experienced in rural rather than urban locations.17
     •   Travel times through a corridor are reduced because of less delay caused by turning vehicles.
     •   The roadway has improved capacity and can serve higher traffic volumes.
     •   Surveys of both drivers and owners of abutting properties have indicated that they typically
         prefer having TWLTLs in order to improve driveway access.

Not all roadways are good candidates for striping TWLTLs. The typical preferred use of a TWLTL is
when the roadway has the following characteristics18:
     •   It is an arterial road with closely spaced, low-volume commercial driveways (i.e., no heavy
         concentrations of left-turning traffic).
     •   Travel speeds are relatively low (25 to 45 mph).
     •   Total roadway volumes are below about 24,000 daily vehicles (i.e., a lower-volume road).19


Traffic Volumes
Because they are the basis of operational and warrant analysis, traffic volumes along Warner Milne
Road were collected during the a.m. (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) and p.m. (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak periods at
the following five driveways:
     •   Warner Milne Rd./Danielson’s West Driveway
     •   Warner Milne Rd./City Hall Driveways
     •   Warner Milne Rd./Barclay Apartments Driveway
     •   Warner Milne Rd./Clackamas Credit Union Driveway
     •   Warner Milne Rd./Clackamas County Sheriff’s Driveway

Only the vehicles entering and exiting the driveways were counted because the current construction
allows for local access traffic but is a deterrent to through traffic. To estimate through traffic volumes
on Warner Milne Road, recent traffic volumes counted prior to construction at the nearby Warner
Milne Road/Molalla Avenue intersection were used, and balancing was performed. The resulting
intersection volumes assumed for this analysis are shown in Figure 1 and detailed count information
is provided in the appendix. A review of the left-turn volumes into the driveways shows there are no
heavy concentrations of left-turning traffic at any of these driveways. For this fact and because of the
close spacing of driveways, a TWLTL would be the preferred option for removing left turns from the
through lanes.

A 24-hour tube count on Warner Milne Road between Beavercreek Road and Molalla Avenue was
also available and the measured traffic volumes and speeds are listed in Table 1. This data was
collected prior to construction and indicates that bi-directional average daily traffic (ADT) volumes
were approximately 7,600 vehicles and the 85th percentile travel speed was 33 mph, which is slightly
higher than the 30-mph speed limit. Therefore, Warner Milne Road is a lower speed, lower volume
roadway and would be a good candidate for a TWLTL. However, because volumes are greater than
3,000 daily vehicles and travel speeds are greater than 25 mph, it is also important to provide bike
lanes on this roadway section.

There were also approximately 135 bikes using the vehicle travel lanes during the day
(approximately two percent of total traffic) based on the traffic count data with approximately 20 of
these occurring during the p.m. peak hour. Because these bicycles were counted with roadway tubes,
it does not include any bicycles that may have been using the sidewalks. Therefore, there is
significant existing demand for bicycle facilities on this roadway.

Intersection Operations
Intersection traffic operations were analyzed for the five study area driveways both with and without
a center two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) in order to compare the operational difference between the
two striping alternatives. The operating conditions were estimated for both the a.m. and p.m. peak
hours using the traffic volumes discussed previously (see Figure 1).

The average delay, level of service (LOS), and volume to capacity (V/C) ratios were determined
using 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology20 and are listed in Table 2. As shown, all
driveways would operate at LOS C or better and meet the Oregon City LOS E operating standard for
unsignalized intersections regardless of whether a center TWLTL is provided.21 Therefore, there are
no operating concerns that indicate a center turn lane is needed.

 The TWLTL analysis assumes 2-stage gap acceptance where vehicles are able to pull out of the driveways and wait in the
TWLTL before merging with traffic. The analysis assumes that TWLTL storage is available for one vehicle.

Left-Turn Lane Warrants
Left turn lane warrants were analyzed at the five study area driveways and are a good indicator of
where left-turn lanes are needed because they take into account roadway characteristics that have
been shown to influence both safety and capacity of left-turn movements (e.g., roadway volumes,
speeds, expected traffic flow, and number of travel lanes). Table 3 provides the results of the warrant
analysis based on methodologies provided by the Highway Research Board (HRB) and ODOT. As
shown, no left-turn lane warrants using either method are met. Therefore, there are no turn lane
volume concerns that indicate a center turn lane is needed.

Collision Analysis
Collision analysis was performed for the segment of Warner Milne Road between Beavercreek Road
(also referred to as Kaen Avenue) and Molalla Avenue. Only those collisions not related to the
Warner Milne Road/Beavercreek Road and Warner Milne Road/Molalla Avenue intersections and
their associated intersection approaches and turn lanes were considered. Therefore, the specific
segment starts 190 feet east of Beavercreek Road and ends 350 feet west of Molalla Avenue.

The collision history for this segment of road was obtained for the most recent three years (i.e., 2006
through 2008) from the ODOT Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit. The data indicate that there were
no reported collisions involving pedestrians or bicyclists during these three years. Instead, this
section of Warner Milne only had the following two reported collisions, though both incidents did
result in injuries (the details were deducted from distance and error code information provided by
ODOT):
       •    On April 28, 2006, an eastbound vehicle improperly turned left into the Oregon City Church
            of Christ back alley and was hit by a westbound through vehicle.
       •    On August 12, 2008, a vehicle exiting the Randji Denture Center did not yield to a
            westbound vehicle turning right into the driveway.

The average yearly collision rate for this segment of Warner Milne Road was calculated based on
these two collisions (0.67 collisions per year), the daily traffic tube count reported previously in this
memorandum (7,600 daily vehicles), and the estimated roadway length (1,360 feet or approximately
one-quarter mile). The resulting collision rate is 0.94 collisions per million vehicle-miles traveled
(VMT). This is lower than the statewide average of 2.49 collisions per million VMT for urban city
minor arterial roadways for the same years (i.e., 2006 to 2008).22 However, because this roadway
section is less than one mile, small changes in assumptions can significantly change the results.
Therefore, ODOT has indicated that a warning should accompany the estimated collision rate.23

The low collision rate for this segment of Warner Milne Road supports the conclusion that there were
no significant safety concerns when a TWLTL was provided. Because TWLTLs improve safety, it is
possible that if the TWLTL is removed, then safety may decrease and there may be an increase in
collisions in the future. Therefore, if City Staff decide to stripe bike lanes instead of a TWLTL, it is
recommended that a before-and-after safety study be performed as data is available in order to verify
the safety effects.


Summary of Findings
Warner Milne Road is currently being repaved and restriped between Beavercreek Road (Kaen
Avenue) and Molalla Avenue. Because the curb-to-curb distance is not wide enough to include both
bike lanes and a center two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL), City Staff must make a decision regarding
which should be provided.

Below is a summary list of findings for the two alternatives based on the previously documented
analysis to assist City Staff in their determination:

     Why a TWLTL may be helpful
      • This section of Warner Milne Road is a good candidate for a TWLTL because it has the
         desired characteristics (i.e., minor arterial classification, no heavy concentrations of left-
         turning traffic, close spacing of driveways, lower travel speeds, and lower traffic volumes).
       •    There were no identified safety concerns when a TWLTL was previously provided.

     Why a TWLTL is not necessary
      • There are no operating concerns that indicate a center turn lane is necessary (i.e., all
         intersections meet operating standards).
       •    There are no turn lane volume concerns that indicate a center turn lane is necessary (i.e., no
            turn lane warrants are met).
       •    Striping a TWLTL prevents the inclusion of bike lanes. This is inconsistent with the Oregon
            City TSP, which indicates that bike lanes are required on minor arterials while a center turn
            lane is optional.
       •    Other minor arterials throughout Oregon City provide bike lanes instead of TWLTLs.

     Why bike lanes are important
      • The Oregon City TSP indicates that bike lanes are required on minor arterials and that
         TWLTLs are optional. Providing bike lanes instead of a TWLTL is also consistent with Goal
         #1 (Multi-Modal Travel Options) of the Oregon City TSP. In particular, Objectives 2, 4, and
         9 are better met by striping bike lanes.24 Because the Oregon City TSP reflects community
         goals, it is an important document to provide guidance for this decision.
       •    The Oregon City TSP identifies the striping of 5- to 6-foot wide bike lanes in both directions
            as a high priority bicycle system improvement (Project B-6).
       •    There is existing demand for bicycle facilities. Tube counts prior to construction indicate that
            135 daily bicyclists use the vehicle travel lanes on this section of Warner Milne Road.
       •    Safety research indicates that bike lanes should be provided because traffic volumes are
            greater than 3,000 daily vehicles and travel speeds are greater than 25 mph.

     Potential considerations should a TWLTL not be provided
      • Striping bike lanes prevents the inclusion of a TWLTL. Therefore, if a TWLTL is not
          provided, it is recommended that a before-and-after safety study be performed as data is
          available in order to verify the safety effects.

Level of Service Descriptions
TRAFFIC LEVELS OF SERVICE
Analysis of traffic volumes is useful in understanding the general nature of traffic in an area, but by itself
indicates neither the ability of the street network to carry additional traffic nor the quality of service
afforded by the street facilities. For this, the concept of level of service has been developed to subjectively
describe traffic performance. Level of service can be measured at intersections and along key roadway
segments.

Level of service categories are similar to report card ratings for traffic performance. Intersections are
typically the controlling bottlenecks of traffic flow and the ability of a roadway system to carry traffic
efficiently is generally diminished in their vicinities. Levels of Service A, B and C indicate conditions
where traffic moves without significant delays over periods of peak travel demand. Level of service D and
E are progressively worse peak hour operating conditions and F conditions represent where demand
exceeds the capacity of an intersection. Most urban communities set level of service D as the minimum
acceptable level of service for peak hour operation and plan for level of service C or better for all other
times of the day. The Highway Capacity Manual provides level of service calculation methodology for
both intersections and arterials. 1 The following two sections provide interpretations of the analysis
approaches.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS (Two-Way Stop Controlled)

Unsignalized intersection level of service is reported for the major street and minor street (generally, left
turn movements). The method assesses available and critical gaps in the traffic stream which make it
possible for side street traffic to enter the main street flow. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual describes
the detailed methodology. It is not unusual for an intersection to experience level of service E or F
conditions for the minor street left turn movement. It should be understood that, often, a poor level of
service is experienced by only a few vehicles and the intersection as a whole operates acceptably.

Unsignalized intersection levels of service are described in the following table.

Level of Service Expected Delay                            (Sec/Veh)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
─
       A         Little or no delay                          0-10.0

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

For signalized intersections, level of service is evaluated based upon average vehicle delay experienced by
vehicles entering an intersection. Control delay (or signal delay) includes initial deceleration delay, queue
move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. In previous versions of this chapter of the HCM
(1994 and earlier), delay included only stopped delay. As delay increases, the level of service decreases.
Calculations for signalized and unsignalized intersections are different due to the variation in traffic
control. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual provides the basis for these calculations.


      Level of  Delay
      Service   (secs.)                     Description
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────
        A       <10.00        Free Flow/Insignificant Delays: No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic and no vehicle waits
                              longer than one red indication. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Progression is extremely favorable and
                              most vehicles arrive during the green phase.

         B          10.1-20.0          Stable Operation/Minimal Delays: An occasional approach phase is fully utilized. Many drivers begin
                                       to feel somewhat restricted within platoons of vehicles. This level generally occurs with good progression,
                                       short cycle lengths, or both.

         C          20.1-35.0          Stable Operation/Acceptable Delays: Major approach phases fully utilized. Most drivers feel somewhat
                                       restricted. Higher delays may result from fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle
                                       failures may begin to appear at this level, and the number of vehicles stopping is significant.

         D          35.1-55.0          Approaching Unstable/Tolerable Delays: The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable.
                                       Drivers may have to wait through more than one red signal indication. Longer delays may result from
                                       some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high v/c ratios. The proportion of
                                       vehicles not stopping declines, and individual cycle failures are noticeable.

         E          55.1-80.0          Unstable Operation/Significant Delays: Volumes at or near capacity. Vehicles may wait though several
                                       signal cycles. Long queues form upstream from intersection. These high delay values generally indicate
                                       poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are a frequent
                                       occurrence.

         F          >80.0              Forced Flow/Excessive Delays: Represents jammed conditions. Queues may block upstream
                                       intersections. This level occurs when arrival flow rates exceed intersection capacity, and is considered to
                                       be unacceptable to most drivers. Poor progression, long cycle lengths, and v/c ratios approaching 1.0 may
                                       contribute to these high delay levels.

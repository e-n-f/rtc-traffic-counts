STUDY AREA
The Airport Road and Main Street intersection is located two miles northeast of downtown Billings,
just north of MetraPark. The intersection’s location is a critical junction for commuter, regional, and
freight trips along the Airport Road and Main Street corridors. Designated as principal arterials, the
two corridors connect recreational, residential neighborhoods (Heights West and East), low density
commercial, and light industrial uses with downtown Billings and Interstate 90. The intersection is
located on the Camino Real International Trade Corridor that connects Canada, United States, and
Mexico. Figure 1 highlights the study area.

PAST PLANS AND STUDIES
Several relevant past plans and studies were reviewed to understand the context of previous work
completed in the study area, and to ensure that future intersection alternatives are consistent with
any planned projects and the community’s vision for the respective corridors. The key findings
relevant to the study area from the five studies are outlined below:


MetraPark Egress Improvements Study (Reference 1)
This study was completed in April 2013 for the Yellowstone County Commission. The study identifies
improvement recommendations to the overall circulation plan for the MetraPark, specifically
ingress/egress changes to access on Main Street between the 4 th Avenue and 6th Avenue and on
Bench Boulevard along the MetraPark frontage.


Traffic Report 6th Ave N/Bench-Blgs, Phase 2 (Reference 2)
This study was completed in November 2012 for the MDT. The study evaluates several alternative
intersection improvements at the 4th Avenue and 6th Avenue intersections with Bench Boulevard and
Main Street. The study recommends the following improvements:

              Main Street and 6th Avenue North/Bench Boulevard – The short term recommendation
               is a no build option. The long term recommendation is the 4th Avenue North Flyover, but
               the timing of this improvement should be revisited once the Billings Bypass is constructed
               and more is known on the development potential within the EBURD and Hospitality
               Corridor.
              Main Street and 1st Avenue North/US 87 – The short term recommendation is the no
               build option. The long term recommendation is a multilane roundabout, but the timing of
               this improvement should be revisited once the Billings Bypass is constructed and more is
               known on the development potential within the EBURD and Hospitality Corridor.
              Airport Road and Main Avenue – No specific improvements were recommended in the
               study. However, it was noted that capacity improvements would be needed in the future,
               as the intersection is projected to operate at a LOS F in 2020 without the Billings Bypass
               and at LOS F in 2033 with the Billings Bypass in place.


Hospitality Corridor Planning Study (Reference 3)
This study was completed in September 2013 for the City of Billings. The study provides a vision to
integrate vehicular and non-vehicular needs within the Highway 87/Main Street/Exposition Drive
corridor. The study includes recommendations for street cross-sections, intersection improvements,
and pedestrian enhancements in the study area.

2014 Billings Urban Area Long Range Transportation Plan (Reference 4)
This plan was completed in August 2014 for the City of Billings / Yellowstone County Metropolitan
Planning Organization. The plan identifies several transportation projects within the study area,
including:

              Roadway, Intersection, and Congestion Management: Airport/Main improvements
               (illustrative), Main Street and 4th Avenue North pavement preservation (committed),
               Main Street signal timing (recommended)
              Pedestrian: Aronson Avenue sidewalks (illustrative), Main Street (US 87) pedestrian
               easement (recommended), MetraPark pedestrian overpass (recommended)
              Bicycle: Airport Road bike lanes (illustrative), Lake Elmo Drive bike lanes (illustrative), 4th
               Avenue bike lanes (illustrative), 6th Avenue bike lanes (illustrative)
              Trails: Swords Park/6th Avenue North Connector (committed), Alkali Creek Trail
               (committed)


East Billings Urban Renewal District (EBURD) Master Plan (Reference 5)
This plan was completed in July 2009 for the Big Sky Economic Development Authority. This plan
defined some prototypical streetscape standards, including guidance on lane width, presence of
street trees, and other modal facilities.


LAND USE AND ZONING
The project area is located mostly within the city limits of Billings, MT; however, the MetraPark area
located south of Bench Boulevard and east of Main Street is owned by Yellowstone County. The
existing zoning within the study area is a mix of industrial, public, highway and community
commercial, and residential.

Figure 2 illustrates the existing zoning for the study area.

There are several restaurants, gas stations, and hotels near the intersection of Airport Road and Main
Street. The southeast region of the study area is occupied by MetraPark and the Yellowstone County
Fairgrounds. This entertainment and trade center facility hosts a wide variety of events (e.g. concerts,
rodeos, sporting games, trade shows) throughout the year. The northern region of the study area is
occupied by commercial and residential uses. The southwest region of the study area includes the
Swords Rimrock Park, which has multiuse trails and points of interest. To the north of the study area,

Within the study area, Earl Gus Park and Swords Park provide multi-use paths for both pedestrians
and bicyclists. These paths are separated and protected from nearby roadways. As shown on Figure 3,
Earl Gus Park is located between Lake Elmo Drive, Airport Road, Main Street, and Bench Boulevard.
The park includes grade separated facilities to access the Jim Dutcher Trail, which runs parallel to
Bench Boulevard and the Yellowstone River. Swords Park is located west of the 6 th Avenue Bypass and
includes several trails for hiking and biking with views overlooking the Rimrocks and the City of
Billings.


TRANSIT FACILITIES
Billings Metropolitan Transit (MET) is the public transportation agency providing fixed-route and
paratransit bus services throughout Billings. There are five fixed-route bus routes providing service
throughout the study area. These routes include: 14P (Alakli), 15P (Hiltop), 16P (Main), 17P (Bench),
and 18M (Heights), all providing weekday service during the a.m. and p.m. peak periods with
headways varying between 60 and 80 minutes. Weekend service is provided by bus route 18P
(Heights) with headways varying between 60 and 80 minutes beginning at 8:40 a.m. This route runs
on Saturday only, with no bus service provided on Sundays. The bus operations include a flag-down
service, but there are a few common locations where buses stop in the study area, as shown in Figure
3.


PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACCESSES
A field inventory of the existing residential and commercial accesses and public street connections
was conducted within the study area. Figure 4 illustrates the location of each approach. There are a
total of 68 accesses, of which 46 are commercial accesses, 18 public street connections, and 4
residential driveways within the study area. There are no residential driveways located on Main
Street or Airport Road. All four residential driveways are located on Swords Lane, north of Airport
Road.

The majority of accesses are in the vicinity of the Airport Road/Main Street intersection and the Lake
Elmo Drive/Main Street intersection. Main Street has 10 commercial accesses between Aronson
Avenue and Lake Elmo Drive. Airport Road has 12 commercial accesses between Bench Boulevard
and 6th Avenue Bypass.

Daily Traffic Volumes on Main Street
Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) provided average annual daily traffic (AADT) volumes
along Main Street for the past 20 years (1995 - 2014). The AADT along Main Street includes two-way
traffic volumes between 1st Avenue and Lake Elmo Drive. In 2014, AADT along Main Street varied
from 46,900 north of Lake Elmo Drive to 38,100 north of 1st Avenue. Exhibit 1 presents a graphical
representation of the range of AADT on Main Street for the past 20 years. When averaging the
segment’s AADT over 20 years, the annual growth rate is approximately 1%. Attachment A includes
the AADT worksheets provided by MDT along Main Street from 1995 – 2015.

in April 2015. The majority of pedestrian and bicyclist activity occurred at the Airport Road/Main
Street intersection and along Bench Boulevard in the vicinity of Earl Gus Park. Table 3 provides
directional pedestrian and bicycle activity where recorded at the study intersections.

There was relatively minimal bicycle activity throughout the study area. Many bicyclists utilize the
multiuse trails within the study area, as they are separated and provide fairly good connectivity from
the neighborhoods to downtown Billings.

Intersection Peak Hour Operations Analysis
Turning movement counts were collected on a typical mid-week day in April 2015 during the a.m.
peak period (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.) and p.m. peak period (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) at each of the
study intersections. Additionally, turning movement counts were collected during an event at the
Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark. The event was a Pro Bull Riding Rodeo on Friday, April 17, 2015.
Turning movement counts were collected between 4:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. to identify event traffic
patterns at nearby study intersections. Attachment B includes the turning movement count data
sheets at the study intersections for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak time periods.

September 30, 2015                                                                                      Page 14


The operational analysis was performed using the following assumptions:

              Synchro 8 was used to model the existing roadway network and analyze the weekday a.m.
               and p.m. peak hour traffic conditions.
              Weekday AM and PM turning movement counts (collected in April 2015)
              Pedestrian and bicycle counts (collected in April 2015)
              Lane geometry, posted speeds, and storage lengths (field collected in April 2015; used
               GoogleEarth to confirm some measurements)
              A 1700 passenger cars/per hour/per lane saturation flow rate was used based on field
               data collected on King Avenue in Billings, as part of the King Avenue Signal Timing project.
              Peak hour factor was calculated from the April 2015 turning movement counts
              Signal timing and phase diagrams were obtained from MDT for the traffic signals on Main
               Street and City of Billings for the Bench Boulevard/Airport Road intersection; The Main
               Street corridor operates in coordination with a cycle length of 130 and 150 seconds during
               the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively.
              The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 (Reference 6) and Synchro 8’s SIMTraffic
               methodology were used in the analysis. The HCM 2000 methodology was used for all of
               the signalized and stop-controlled intersections as it produced consistent results with our
               field observations in comparison to using the HCM 2010, except for the stop-controlled
               intersections of Aronson Avenue/6th Avenue Bypass and Aronson Avenue/Main Street. At
               the Aronson Avenue/6th Avenue Bypass intersection, the lane geometry and stop-
               controlled operations are not accommodated in the HCM. At the Aronson Avenue/Main
               Street intersection, the northbound left-turn movement was observed to maneuver when
               the northbound left-turn at the Airport Road/Main Street signalized intersection received
               the green arrow. The macroscopic nature of the HCM model is unable to capture this
               operational benefit from an upstream traffic signal. Therefore, Synchro 8’s SimTraffic, a
               microsimulation tool was used to report the operational results at these two
               intersections. HCM 2010 was used to analyze the merge condition at the Airport
               Road/Alkali Creek Road on-ramp (Reference 7).
              Intersection performance measures reported in this study include, but are not limited to,
               level of service (LOS), volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C), delay, and 95th percentile queue
               lengths. MDT has adopted level-of-service standards for facilities, detailed in Chapter 3 of
               the MDT Road Design Manual. For a Principal Urban Arterial, the desirable LOS is LOS “B”
               or LOS “C” per the MDT Road Design Manual (Reference 8). In urban conditions, a LOS “D”
               or LOS “E” and a volume-to-capacity ratio of less than 0.90 are often acceptable. The LOS
               “B” and LOS “C” criteria are more pertinent for freeways and two-lane highways versus
               the urban arterial conditions within the study area.

September 30, 2015                                                                                    Page 15


Figure 5 presents the existing lane configuration and traffic control devices at the study intersections.
Figure 6 and Figure 7 summarize the operational analysis at the study intersections during the
weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Attachment C includes the existing conditions operational results
from Synchro 8 during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

As shown in Figures 6 and 7, most of the study intersections currently operate at a level of service C
or better during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. However, the following intersections are
identified as either not meeting the LOS C criteria or have a volume-to-capacity ratio of greater than
0.90:
          Main Street/Lake Elmo Drive (AM v/c = 0.97)
              Main Street/Airport Road (AM v/c = 0.92, PM LOS D and v/c = 0.92)
              Main Street/Aronson Avenue (PM LOS = D for northbound left-turn)
              Main Street/6th Avenue (AM v/c = 1.00, PM v/c = 0.97)
              Main Street/4th Avenue (PM LOS D and v/c = 0.96)
As observed in the field, the main Street corridor between 4th Avenue and Lake Elmo Drive is
operating near capacity during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour.

Queue lengths were evaluated at the signalized intersections along the Main Street corridor to
identify if any deficiencies in queue spillback occur during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The
95th percentile queue lengths are calculated using Synchro 8 and represents the worst-case queue
that occurs 5% of the time.

Figure 8 illustrates the 95th percentile critical queue lengths at the study intersections during the
weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The following are results from the analysis and observations from
the field visit:

              Lake Elmo Drive/Main Street – The 95th percentile queue length for the eastbound right
               exceeds the storage length during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. There is
               currently an exclusive right-turn lane with a storage length of 100 feet, which is
               inadequate to accommodate the right-turn traffic volume. Additionally, during the
               weekday a.m. peak period, vehicles making that right-turn have limited opportunity to
               make a right-turn on red due to the heavy throughput on Main Street. Vehicle queues for
               the southbound through movement reach their maximum length during the weekday a.m.
               peak period, extending roughly 500 feet from the intersection.
              Airport Road/Main Street - The eastbound left turn experiences high delay and at times
               long vehicle queues during the weekday p.m. peak hour. The split-phasing for the
               eastbound and westbound movements limits the green time for the eastbound left turn.
               During the weekday a.m. peak hour, vehicle queues in the southbound through direction
               were observed to spill back to the Lake Elmo Drive intersection.

September 30, 2015                                                                                     Page 20


               There is currently no southbound right-turn lane, so vehicles making the right-turn on to
               Airport Road must wait until the southbound through movement gets a green indication.
               Vehicle queues in the northbound direction varied based on time of day, but were longest
               during the weekday p.m. peak hour. The northbound vehicle queues were observed to
               spillback to or past the Aronson Drive/Main Street intersection. Vehicle queues for the
               northbound left movement never exceeded the storage length provided in either of the
               peak periods as the majority of vehicles making a left off of Main Street in the northbound
               direction use Aronson Avenue as an alternate route.
              Aronson Avenue/Main Street – The unsignalized intersection of Aronson Avenue/Main
               Street experiences a high volume of northbound left turns (495 in the p.m. peak hour).
               This movement was observed to fill the storage length turn lane and on occasion, spill
               back into the through lanes on Main Street.
              6th Avenue/Main Street/Bench Boulevard - The northbound left turn is at capacity during
               the weekday a.m. peak hour, which results in queues exceeding the storage lane. During
               the weekday p.m. peak hour, the queue length of the northbound through movement was
               observed to spillback past the 4th Avenue/Main Street intersection, resulting in a lack of
               progression for vehicles trying to make a left from 4th Avenue onto Main Street.
              4th Avenue/Main Street - The eastbound left turn experiences long delays and queues
               during the weekday p.m. peak hour. This movement often slows or stops during its phase
               to join the platoon of vehicles headed in the northbound direction along Main Street.
               When the eastbound left turn’s phase turns green, vehicles must wait for the northbound
               through queue on Main Street to clear before entering the intersection, resulting in an
               underutilized phase at the 4th Avenue/Main Street intersection. In addition, the
               southbound through queue length reaches storage capacity during the weekday a.m. peak
               hour. Spillback into the 6th Avenue intersection was not observed; however, at times
               southbound through queues at 4th Avenue did inhibit westbound left turns from Bench
               Boulevard from being able to turn onto Main Street and head south.


Event Traffic Conditions
Turning movement counts were collected at each of the study intersections on Friday, April 17, 2015
from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Counts were collected to analyze the impact of event traffic on
roadways and intersections within the study area. The Rimrock Auto Area at MetraPark has a capacity
of 12,000 seats and was host to the Professional Bull Riding Rodeo from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on
that evening.

Event counts during the Friday p.m. peak period were higher than the non-event weekday p.m. peak
hour conditions. At the Airport Road/Main Street intersection, the total entering volume was
approximately 3.3% higher during the event than the non-event condition, which is not a significant
change. However, event counts indicate turning movement counts onto Airport Road in the

eastbound direction increased 61% during the Friday p.m. peak hour. Other than the Friday p.m. peak
hour containing a higher percentage of vehicles turning onto eastbound Airport Road, peak
characteristics under event conditions were generally the same as the non-event, weekday p.m. peak
hour conditions.

After the event completed, traffic increased at the intersections between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
The eastbound approach at the Airport Road/Main Street intersection accounted for approximately
28% of the total entering volume at the intersection, in comparison to 2% during non-event
conditions. Exhibit 3 compares the total entering volumes between event and non-event conditions
at Airport Road/Main Street.

The Bench Boulevard/Airport Road intersection serves as the main exit for vehicles leaving the arena.
Exhibit 4 compares the total entering volumes between event and non-event conditions at Bench
Boulevard/Airport Road. After the event completed, traffic increased by approximately 21% at the
intersection between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. The westbound approach accounted for
approximately 64% of the total entering volume at the intersection, in comparison to less than 1%
during non-event conditions.

Overall, the peak hour totals of event traffic were within the range of the traffic volumes counted
during the midweek p.m. peak hour. However, specific approaches at the intersections experience a
significant increase in volume when the event lets out. At this time, no additional traffic operations
analysis was completed at the study intersections under an event condition. However, a sensitivity
check and discussion about event conditions is planned for the different alternatives, as the study
moves into the development and evaluation of the alternatives. Attachment D contains the turning
movement counts collected during the event peak period.


CRASH HISTORY
Crash data from the previous five years (2010 – 2014) was obtained from MDT and was used to
evaluate crash trends within the study area. Crash data was summarized at each of the study
intersections. Overall, there were 383 crashes, including 1 fatality over a 5-year period in the study
area. Injury related crashes accounted for 36% of all reported crashes. There were no crashes
reported at the unsignalized intersection of Aronson Avenue/Swords Lane or the signalized
intersection of Bench Boulevard/Airport Road. Table 4 presents the severity of total reported crashes,
as well as a crash rate for each intersection which is the ratio of crashes per million entering vehicles
at each of the study intersections.

The crash rate is a useful tool to measure the relative safety at a particular intersection, as well as
how it compares to the average intersection along a specific corridor or roadway network.
Oftentimes, a crash rate is used to prioritize locations for safety improvements. An intersection or

roadway crash rate greater than 1.00 is an indication that a particular crash type may warrant
additional analysis to potentially implement a mitigation to improve safety at the intersection or
along the roadway.

Notes: Crash data provided by Montana Department of Transportation for years 2010 – 2014.


The Lake Elmo Drive/Main Street and Airport Road/Main Street intersections have crash rates greater
than 1.00. Both intersections have the two highest totals of reported crashes. Rear-end crashes
accounted for approximately two-thirds of the reported crashes at both intersections, which is a
common crash type at signalized intersections.

Nearly 25% of crashes occurred during
the weekday p.m. peak period (4:00 p.m.
– 6:00 p.m.). No crash trends were
identified within specific months of the
year. However, 21% of crashes occurred
on wet/snowy/icy pavement.

In addition to the intersection crashes, there were a total of 44 reported crashes that occurred on the
individual segments on Main Street between 4th Street and Lake Elmo Drive. The highest crash types
were rear-end and side-swipe. Historical crash data is available through MDT and is included within
the project file.


ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN
The purpose of the environmental scan was to identify potential environmental constraints within the
study area to inform the development and evaluation of alternatives during the concept phase, and
for future insights as this project moves into final design. This environmental scan is not meant to be
used as or substituted for a comprehensive environmental investigation. If improvement options
are forwarded from this study into project development, an analysis for compliance with the National
and Montana Environmental Policy Acts (NEPA and MEPA) will be completed as part of the Montana
Department of Transportation (MDT) project development process. Information provided in this

study may be forwarded into the NEPA/MEPA process at that time. Attachment E includes the
complete environmental scan document.


ACCESS MANAGEMENT
This section describes existing access spacing along the Main Street and Airport Road corridors in
comparison to MDT access control spacing guidelines from the MDT Road Design Manual and
Montana Right-of-Way Operations Manual (Reference 9).

MDT’s access spacing guidelines for roadways classified as National Highway System (NHS), undivided
and divided, and in a developed area are:

              Undivided (Airport Road – 45 mph): Signal spacing is ¼ mile. Minimum unsignalized access
               spacing is 325 to 375 feet.
              Divided (Main Street – 35 mph): Signal spacing is ¼ mile. Median opening spacing is ¼ mile
               for full movement and 1/8 mile for directional only. Minimum unsignalized access spacing
               is 250 feet.
Attachment F includes the Recommended Montana Access Guidelines figure from the Montana Right-
of-Way Operations Manual.

As shown in Figure 4, there are several commercial accesses located near the Airport Road and Main
Street intersection. In general, the roadway segments near the Airport Road and Main Street
intersection do not currently meet the MDT access control spacing guidelines presented above.

As this study moves forward into the next phase, additional research will be conducted regarding
access control and the access deeds in place for the parcels near the Airport Road and Main Street
intersection. Additionally, access consideration will be included in the evaluation and assessment of
the different intersection alternatives in the next phase of the study.


Year 2040 Future Conditions

There are no design plans for these improvements. Most of the improvements are focused on
improving the pedestrian and bicycle connectivity in the area. These improvements are not included
in the analysis for the purposes of establishing a base future year 2040 condition.

However, there are two committed projects that have a significant impact on the projected traffic
volumes on Main Street and in the study area.

              The Billings Bypass Arterial project, located to the northeast of the study area is a
               committed project that will be moving into the design phase in 2015. This project provides
               a new 3-lane connection between Old Highway 312 and Highway 87 (Main Street) in
               Billings to the Johnson Lane interchange in Lockwood.
              The Inner Belt Loop project, located to the northwest of the study area is a committed
               project that will provide a new 2-lane connection between Wicks Lane/Skyview Drive to
               Zimmerman Trail.
These two projects, along with several other regional transportation improvement projects are
included in the regional travel demand model.


YEAR 2040 TRAFFIC VOLUMES
The MDT travel demand model for the Billings Urban Area/Yellowstone County was used to develop
year 2040 traffic volume forecasts on the roadway links and intersections within the study area. The
methodology included the following steps:

              Verify model input - The 2035 travel demand model inputs were reviewed to identify any
               potential changes to roadway connections, number of travel lanes, and speed. The
               recommended changes to the 2035 travel demand model were coordinated with MDT
               Planning to update and rerun the travel demand model output.
              Check reasonableness of model output - The year 2035 daily traffic volumes from the
               travel demand model were reviewed and compared with the year 2035 daily traffic

September 30, 2015                                                                                       Page 27


               volumes included in the 2035 Billings Urban-Area LRTP model run. Additionally, the
               directional daily volumes were obtained from MDT for each of the roadway segments in
               the study area. Once the data looked reasonable, the year 2035 daily traffic volumes were
               used to develop year 2040 turning movement counts at the study intersections during the
               weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
              Develop future year 2040 turning movement counts – MDT provided year 2010 and 2035
               daily, directional traffic volumes from the travel demand model for the roadway links
               within the study area. The year 2010 daily volumes, year 2035 daily volumes, and year
               2015 turning movement counts (actual count data) were used to estimate year 2040
               turning movement counts.
                         The year 2010 and 2035 daily, directional link volumes were adjusted to obtain
                          weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour link, directional volumes.

                         The incremental annual change between year 2010 and year 2035 directional link
                          volumes was calculated and added for 25 years to the actual year 2015 traffic
                          count, peak hour, directional link volumes to obtain year 2040 directional link
                          volumes. Note: Using the actual peak hour count data along with the incremental
                          change from the two model year link volumes provides a more accurate
                          representation of the year 2040 link volumes when compared to just using the
                          model output.

                         The year 2010 peak hour, directional link volumes, year 2040 peak hour,
                          directional link volumes, and year 2015 turning movement counts (actual count
                          data) were used to estimate year 2040 turning movement counts during the
                          weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The ratio and difference methodology from
                          NCHRP Report 765 – Analytical Travel Forecasting Approaches for Project-Level
                          Planning and Design (incorporates the methodology from NCHRP 255) was applied
                          using these three data sets to estimate the year 2040 turning movement counts at
                          the study intersections (Reference 10). Attachment G includes the travel demand
                          model output and analysis worksheets.

              The year 2040 turning movement counts and years 2035 and 2040 peak hour link volumes
               were reviewed for consistency and reasonableness, and compared with recent studies
               and plans for this area, including Billings Urban Area LRTP, Billings Bypass EIS, and Traffic
               Report 6th Ave N/Bench-Blgs, Phase 2. Once confirmed, the year 2040 turning movement
               counts were added to the traffic operational model in Synchro to perform an operations
               analysis during the year 2040 traffic conditions, weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
Table 6 summarizes the link volumes within study area and percent change between the year 2015
and 2040 daily traffic volumes.

As shown in Table 6 the average annual growth is approximately 1.4% percent on Main Street and
2.1% percent on Airport Road. Main Street is projected to carry approximately 56,000 to 81,000 daily
traffic volumes with the Billings Bypass Arterial in place. Airport Road is projected to carry
approximately 22,000 to 35,000 daily traffic volumes with the Billings Bypass Arterial in place. Figures
9 and 10 illustrate the year 2040 traffic volumes during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours,
respectively.


OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS
An operational analysis was performed at the study intersections using the same methodology and
assumptions under existing conditions with the exception of the following:
       At the signalized intersections, the phase splits were optimized to account for the change
           in traffic volumes. Cycle lengths were not adjusted at this time, but will be optimized as
           part of the alternatives analysis in the next phase of the study.
                 Future year 2040 traffic volumes were used for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
                 A peak hour factor of 1.0 was used for this planning-level analysis.
The operational analysis results are shown in Figures 9 and 10. As shown in the operational analysis,
all of the signalized intersections and most of the unsignalized intersections are projected to operate
at LOS E or worse and a volume-to-capacity ratio of greater than 1.0 under year 2040 weekday a.m.
and p.m. peak hour traffic conditions. The operational analysis is consistent with the findings from the
Billings Urban Area LRTP and Traffic Report 6th Ave N/Bench-Blgs, Phase 2. Attachment H includes the
Year 2040 Weekday AM and PM Peak Hour Level of Service Worksheets.

Summary
The key findings from the existing and future conditions analysis are highlighted below.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
              The AADT on Main Street ranges from 38,000 to the north of 1st Avenue to 48,000 to the
               north of Lake Elmo Drive.
              The Airport Road/Main Street intersection has a total entering volume of 4,570 vehicles
               during the weekday p.m. peak hour, which is approaching the threshold between large
               signalized intersections and alternative intersection forms (e.g., displaced let-turns,
               quadrants, median u-turns). The critical movements are the eastbound left turn (285 AM,
               635 PM), southbound right-turn (400 AM, 315 PM), northbound through (710 AM, 2,135
               PM), and southbound through (1,940 AM, 1,205 PM) during the weekday a.m. and p.m.
               peak hours.
              The Airport Road and Main Street corridors are located on a major freight route, El
               Camino Real Trade Corridor. The Airport Road/Main Street intersection has the highest
               percentage of heavy vehicles in the study area, ranging between 3.5% and 5.6% during
               the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively. The northbound left (42%) from
               Main Street onto Airport Road and eastbound right (26%) from Airport Road onto Main
               Street are the movements with the highest heavy vehicle percentages.
              Most of the study intersections currently operate at a level of service C or better during
               the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. However, the following intersections exceed the
               the LOS C criteria or have a volume-to-capacity ratio of greater than 0.90:
                     o Main Street/Lake Elmo Drive (AM v/c = 0.97)
                     o Main Street/Airport Road (AM v/c = 0.93, PM LOS D and v/c = 0.93)
                     o Main Street/Aronson Avenue (PM LOS = D for northbound left-turn)
                     o Main Street/6th Avenue (AM v/c = 1.00, PM v/c = 0.97)
                     o Main Street/4th Avenue (PM LOS D and v/c = 0.96)
              As observed in the field and presented in the operations analysis, the Main Street corridor
               between 4th Avenue and Lake Elmo Drive is operating near capacity during the weekday
               a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
              The MetraPark is a major activity center that is host to a variety of concerts, sports events,
               and other event types during the year. Overall, the total intersection peak hour event
               traffic volumes are within the range of the non-event traffic volumes. However, specific
               approaches at the study intersections experience a significant increase in volume when an
Airport Rd/Main St – Billings, CM 1099(102), UPN 8718000                                       Project #: 18460
September 30, 2015                                                                                      Page 32


               event lets out. A sensitivity check and discussion about event conditions is planned as the
               study moves into the development and evaluation of the alternatives.
              Over the past five years (2010 – 2014), there were 383 reported crashes, including 1
               fatality at the study area intersections and roadway segments. The highest crash types at
               the study intersections were rear-end crashes and right angle crashes, accounting for 61%
               and 14% of total crashes, respectively.
              The Lake Elmo Drive/Main Street and Airport Road/Main Street intersections have crash
               rates greater than 1.00. Both intersections have the two highest totals of reported
               crashes. Rear-end crashes accounted for approximately two-thirds of the reported crashes
               at both intersections.
              Based on the environmental scan, the study area includes the following key items for
               further assessment with the alternatives development and evaluation phase of the study
               and future design phase: three Section 4(f) properties: Swords Park, Earl Guss Park, and
               MetraPark; three historical properties: Black Otter Trail, Boothill Cemetery, and Larry’s
               Overlook; two inactive and three active hazardous materials sites; three listed endangered
               species and two candidate species; and a classified surface water with Alkali Creek.
              There are a total of 68 accesses, of which 46 are commercial accesses, 18 public street
               connections, and 4 residential driveways within the study area. The majority of accesses
               are in the vicinity of the Airport Road/Main Street intersection and the Lake Elmo
               Drive/Main Street intersection. Main Street has 10 commercial accesses between Aronson
               Avenue and Lake Elmo Drive. Airport Road has 12 commercial accesses between Bench
               Boulevard and 6th Avenue Bypass. The MDT access spacing guidelines for Airport Road and
               Main Street are not met in the vicinity of the Airport Road and Main Street intersection.


FUTURE CONDITIONS
              The Billings Bypass Arterial and Inner Belt Loop are committed projects with a significant
               impact on the projected year 2040 traffic volumes on Main Street and Airport Road.
              The annual growth between year 2015 and 2040 is approximately 1.4% percent along
               Main Street and approximately 2.1% percent along Airport Road.
              Main Street is projected to carry approximately 56,000 to 81,000 daily traffic volumes
               with the Billings Bypass Arterial in place. Airport Road is projected to carry approximately
               22,000 to 35,000 daily traffic volumes with the Billings Bypass Arterial in place
              All of the signalized intersections and most of the unsignalized intersections are projected
               to operate at LOS E or worse and a volume-to-capacity ratio of greater than 1.0 under
               year 2040 traffic conditions, weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour conditions. The
               operational analysis is consistent with the findings from the Billings Urban Area LRTP and
               Traffic Report 6th Ave N/Bench-Blgs, Phase 2.

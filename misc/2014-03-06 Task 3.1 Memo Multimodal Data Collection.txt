Task 3.1 – “Before” Multimodal Traffic Data – Bend Galveston Corridor Plan
March 6, 2014
Page 2 of 11

Six intersections were chosen for study as shown in Figure 1. All of the intersections are two-way stop controlled
with traffic flowing mostly unrestricted on Galveston Avenue. The exception is the Galveston Avenue/Harmon
Boulevard intersection, where westbound vehicles on Galveston Avenue are prohibited from making a left turn,
and movements off of Harmon Boulevard are restricted to right turns only. The roadway has one 12-foot travel
lane in each direction, with a 10-foot shared two-way left turn lane (TWLTL) beginning just west of Harmon
Boulevard and continuing until the splitter islands at the 14th Street roundabout. Parking is prohibited along
both sides of the roadway and standard 5-foot bike lanes are present in both directions. Sidewalks are present
along most of the roadway with gaps on the south side west of Federal Street to the midblock alley and east of
Harmon Boulevard to the bridge.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Volumes
Bicycle and pedestrian volumes were collected at all
six study intersections on November 12th and 13th of
2013 and are attached. These counts were taken over
a two-hour period from 4-6 p.m. The recorded
volumes are shown in Figure 2. Bicycle and Pedestrian
volumes vary seasonally, and results from Bend’s
Bicycle and Pedestrian Documentation Project 5
suggest volumes could be four to five times higher
during the summer seasonal peak.

Two of the intersections, 12th Street and Columbia
Street, feature a continental-style painted crosswalk                  A Cascade East Transit Bus Stop
across Galveston Avenue along the west leg of the
intersection. There are three transit stops for Cascade East Transit (CET) Route 11 in the study area as shown in
Figure 2, scheduled for two arrivals during the peak hour.

The highest pedestrian volumes crossing Galveston
Avenue occur at the painted crosswalks, indicating high
compliance in using the marked crossings. Bike
volumes were highest at Galveston Avenue/Harmon
Boulevard, where 46 bikes were recorded entering the
intersection. The lowest volumes were at Columbia
Street/Elgin Avenue/Harmon Boulevard (11 bikes) and
Galveston Avenue/13th Street (27 bikes). Figure 3
shows bicycle movements at each intersection along
Galveston Avenue categorized as through, crossing,
entering, or exiting the corridor. The roadways of 12th
Street and Harmon Boulevard are the most popular
                                                                      A Bicyclist Rides along Galveston Ave.
places for bicyclists to enter, exit, and cross Galveston
Avenue, consistent with their designation as shared roadways.

Motor Vehicle Volumes
Motor vehicle volumes were collected at all six study intersections on November 12th and 13th of 2013 during the
same two-hour period as the bicycle and pedestrian counts and are attached. The volumes for the peak hour
are shown in Figure 4. The majority of the traffic volumes on Galveston Avenue travel through the corridor,
indicated by the low turn movement volumes. The highest turning volumes are at the intersection of Galveston
Avenue/Harmon Boulevard where just over 19% of eastbound traffic turns north. Columbia Street has the most
motor vehicles crossing Galveston Avenue.

Using the modeling software SynchroTM 8, traffic operations at the study intersections were evaluated using
2010 Highway Capacity Manual methodology for two-way stop controlled intersections. The results are
summarized in Table 1 and computations are attached. The City of Bend sets mobility standards for two-way
stop controlled intersections by average delay for the critical lane group, which must be less than or equal to 50
seconds during the peak hour. 6 Currently, the southbound left turn at the intersection of Galveston
Avenue/Columbia Street does not meet the City’s mobility standard in terms of delay during the p.m. peak hour.

Vehicle Yielding Rates to Pedestrians
To quantify how the preferred design improvements may alter driver behavior, vehicle yielding rates to
pedestrians were collected at two of the study intersections to establish a baseline condition. The intersections
at Columbia Street and Federal Street were selected so that both a marked and non-marked crosswalk location
would be included. The study protocol was based on methodology described in “TCRP Report 112/NCHRP
Report 562: Improving Pedestrian Safety at Signalized Crossings.” 7

General population pedestrians were observed crossing Galveston
Avenue at these two locations on-site and in video recorded as part of
the vehicle counts at each intersection. This was supplemented with
staged crossings at each location conducted by DKS staff. During the
afternoon peak period, 12 – 2 p.m., each intersection was observed for
an hour in alternating half-hour periods. When no general population
pedestrians were using the intersection, crossings were staged to
ensure at least 40 crossing events were captured in the hour. Further
observations were recorded for both intersections from two-hour
videos recorded from 4 – 6 p.m. as part of the traffic volume counts.

For every crossing the following information was recorded:

    •   Number of pedestrians and whether it was a staged crossing.
    •   Time, in seconds, elapsed between visible intent to cross and
        the first yielding vehicle. If no delay was observed or no vehicles A Pedestrian's View of the Crosswalk
        were present a value of zero was recorded.                             on Galveston Ave. at Columbia St.
    •   Number of yielding vehicles in the near direction of travel
        (those approaching from the left).
    •   Number of non-yielding vehicles in the near direction of travel.
    •   Number of yielding vehicles in the far direction of travel (those approaching from the right).
    •   Number of non-yielding vehicles in the far direction of travel.

Consistent with Oregon law, the staged pedestrian approached the crossing, made an attempt to cross, and
waited until motorists in the closest lane of travel stopped or yielded the right-of-way. An attempt to cross,
initiated by placing one foot into the roadway, was only made when approaching vehicles were beyond
acceptable stopping sight distance (i.e., far enough from the crossing location) based on the posted speed of the
roadway. 8 They then began crossing, but waited to enter the further lanes until motorists had again stopped or
yielded. Oregon law requires vehicles, including bicycles, to yield to pedestrians in their lane or in either lane
adjacent to theirs. Vehicles that did not stop when required to were counted as not yielding. Vehicles that
slowed down without passing through the crosswalk to permit the staged pedestrian to safely cross were
considered yielding vehicles. Vehicles that were too close to comfortably stop – estimated as being inside the
stopping sight distance – were not counted.

A summary of the results is shown in Table 2. During the afternoon period, both intersections had yielding rates
of over 80%, with yielding rates at Columbia Street (marked crossing) being slightly higher. During evening
observations, yielding rates were lower and over 90% of pedestrians crossed at Columbia Street.

Bicyclist Lateral Positioning
Bicyclist lateral positioning within the bike lane was used to characterize bicyclist comfort along Galveston
Avenue. Using in-person observations and recorded video records, each passing bicyclist was classified by their
choice of riding location. Three positions were defined within the bike lane – centered, near the curb edge, or
near the inside edge (motor vehicle travel lane). Bicyclists riding in the motor vehicle travel lanes or on the
sidewalks were also recorded. The position of a bicyclist within the bike lane can indicate their level of comfort
and confidence – given a range of available riding positions, more comfortable or confident cyclists will likely
ride closer to the traffic side of a bike lane. Bicyclists positioning themselves near the curb or on the sidewalk are
thought to be less comfortable or confident. It should be noted that other factors can influence a bicyclist’s
position such as debris, drains, and adjacent parked cars. These observations were taken prior to the winter
season, during which more road debris and gravel collect toward the
curb. Drain grates, though bike-friendly in design, are present
curbside along the corridor and riders may actively avoid them. On
street parking introduces the danger of being hit by opening doors,
but this is not an issue for the existing Galveston Avenue conditions.

During the in-person staged pedestrian crossings described above,
bicyclist information was also recorded by DKS staff. This was
supplemented with video records taken midblock on Galveston
Avenue between 12th Street and Federal Street from 4 – 6 p.m.
Results are shown in Figure 5. Over 85% of the 61 observed bicyclists
positioned themselves in the center of the bike lane or near the
                                                                      Curbside Drain Grate in the Bike Lane
inside edge, divided evenly between the two positions. Driver
behavior was also observed in the recorded video, where 10 drivers were seen to pass bicyclists. Of these, all
drivers moved away from the bicyclists when passing them and 40% moved over a foot into the TWLTL.

Crash Records
The City of Bend has undertaken significant recent work to determine the causes, types, and characteristics of
crashes in the city, and how reductions to crashes can be achieved given limited resources. Bend undertook a
Multimodal Traffic Safety Program 9 in 2012 to screen and evaluate the transportation system and look at
countermeasures at locations with the potential to reduce crashes. Bend established five focus areas for
reduction: fatal and injury crashes, alcohol-involved crashes, speed-involved crashes, pedestrian and bicyclist
crashes, and roadway departure crashes. The program did not identify any high-crash locations within this
project’s study area, but does provide a context and framework for evaluating road safety in Bend.

Crash records at the study intersections were obtained from the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) 10
for the previous five years (2008 – 2012) and are attached. A total of 15 crashes were recorded during this time
period. The collisions are summarized in Table 4 by severity and vehicle movement. The majority of crashes
(80%) involved minor or no injuries, and there were no fatal crashes. No crashes involved drugs, alcohol, or
speeding. Most crashes involved turns (47%) and rear-end collisions (33%). There were no roadway departure
crashes.

There was one crash involving a pedestrian, an injury B crash, at the intersection of Galveston Avenue/Federal
Street. An injury B crash involving a bike was recorded at the intersection of Galveston Avenue/13th Street. Both
of these crashes occurred during clear days and involved a left turning vehicle failing to yield. In the pedestrian
collision the vehicle was turning left onto Galveston Avenue, while the bike was struck by a vehicle turning left
off Galveston Avenue. The most severe crash within the study area was an injury A at the intersection of
Galveston Avenue/13th Street. Occurring during a clear day, it was an improper left turn off Galveston Avenue
resulting in an overturned vehicle.

Crash rates, commonly referred to as crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV), compare the total number of
collisions over the last five years to the total volume of traffic that entered the intersection. The crash rates are
included in Table 3. It is generally accepted that intersections are flagged for review for crash rates greater than
1.0. Crash rates can also be compared to ODOT’s statewide average rates. 11 From 2008 to 2012, minor arterials
in urban cities averaged 3.10 crashes per MEV. Based on this, there does not appear to be major safety concerns
at any of the study intersections.

Disclaimer: The information contained in this report is compiled from individual driver and police crash reports submitted to the Oregon Department of Transportation as required in ORS 811.720. The Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit is committed to providing the highest quality crash data to customers. However, because submittal of crash report forms is
the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate. Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property
damage only crashes being eligible for inclusion in the Statewide Crash Data File.

                 Applicable Principles of the Urban Design Plan

      After review of the Lake Oswego Urban Design Plan, http://www.ci.oswego.or.us/lora/urban-design-
      plan, we find the relevant objectives applied to this project are as follows. These general statements are
      then followed by an application of the specific exceptions.


      APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLE
      The project inlcudes housing being developed within the
      designated FAR for the site along with associated retail.
      The housing will be provide support to
      the retail core and to the cultural and
      recreational activitites in compliance
      with this UDP objective. The project is
      not requesting any exceptions to height or
      FAR

      The project creates multiple street edges
      with townhouse entrances, stepped back
      façade at levels 4 and 5, landscaping, street
      trees, eave lines at level three and the like
      which creates a floor, wall and roof in
      conformance with this standard.




      The project integrates and consolidates
      parking with the development. On street
      parking is per city standards and integrates
      sidewalk and street landscape treatments

The project enhances the pedestrian
experience at the street level with varying
experiences, planters and patios along the
sidewalk edge, paths to front doors, and
street furniture. Perhaps most notably, the
project creates new pedestrian ways within
and through the site creating transparency
and traversibility.




The project creates a lively and attractive
urban core experience by increasing the
density and mix of uses, integrating these
uses vertically in buildings as well as
horizontally on street level.




The project enhances residential character
through variety and vitality as it provides
differentiated architecture for the
townhomes at street level and residential
units with decks at mid level and residential
units hidden in the roof at the upper level.




Recognizable residential features such as a
roof line at the third story level, decks,

      divided windows, patios and front doors at the sidewalk edge at the townhomes, create a
      character similar to the townhomes across the street and unify the development and its
      neighborhood.



      The project is part of a special compact shopping
      district.

      The proposal provides structured below grade
      parking,
      pedestrian ways connecting the adjacent
      community along with landscaping, art, and
      retail focused on First St with high-density
      multifamily housing on upper floors of the
      shopping district buildings to add activity.

      The architecture creates shops with special
      character in a high quality retail frontage that
      finishes the preferred double-sided retail along
      First Street.

      The project also connects with existing retail
      on A Avenue at the corner of Second St and the
      existing housing on the remaining length of B Avenue.


      Project provides high density retail
      activity centered by First Street, with
      pedestrian-oriented walk ways
      providing other opportunities to enjoy
      landscaping planters, espaliers, and
      artwork, solar access, special signage
      and lighting.

                                                        SUMMARY


      The Urban Design Plan states that it “illustrates intent while the City retains the flexibility to respond to
      the specific economic, market and functional circumstances that may arise during the life of the plan.”
      “The primary basis of the Plan is the Vision Statement that was adopted as the preamble to The East End
      Redevelopment Plan.”

      That vision states a number of ways to judge that
      development is successful:

          •    A feeling of vitality that will attract people both day
               and evening is provided.
          •    Environ is colorful with landscape and trees.
          •    Pleasant pedestrian facilities are provided.
          •    Provides adequate parking
          •    Provides a mix of housing and retail
          •    Provides access to natural resources including
               territorial views of the lake, mountains.

      In meeting these judgment factors, the alternative
      designs proposed accomplish the purposes of the Urban
      Design Plan in a manner that is equal or superior to a
      project designed to this standard.

      We believe that this project follows the guidelines and
      improves upon the Urban Design Plan.

      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
      Evergreen Group LLC is proposing to redevelop the downtown block in Lake Oswego, Oregon commonly
      referred to as Block 137 or the Wizer Block. The block is surrounded by 1St Street, Evergreen Road, 2nd
      Street and A Avenue. Today, the block includes 72,700 square feet of retail and restaurant space
      supported by 171 on-site parking stalls. Once redeveloped, the site is expected to consist of:

               28,000 square feet of ground floor specialty retail and restaurant space,
               228 residential units,
               457 underground parking stalls (322 for residents and their guests and 135 for retail and general
                public use), and
               229 on-site bicycle parking spaces (219 for residents and 10 for retail and general public use).

      In addition, a net of five on-street parking spaces will be added along the site frontage and two new
      truck loading zone spaces will be added on 1st and 2nd Streets. A loading zone is also proposed along
      Evergreen Road’s NO PARKING zone to facilitate trash service.

      The redevelopment project will replace nine existing driveways with two driveways. A driveway on 2nd
      Street will provide access to the on-site residential parking. On-site public retail parking will be accessed
      via a driveway on 1st Street that will be located across from the existing Lakeview Village parking lot
      driveway. Construction on the block is expected to begin in 2014 and build-out and full occupancy is
      expected in 2016.

      The results of this study indicate that the proposed redevelopment can be constructed while
      maintaining acceptable traffic operations and safety at the study intersections. The study also indicates
      that the proposed on-site parking satisfies the requirements in the City code.


      FINDINGS
      An analysis of daily traffic volume profiles revealed that the weekday p.m. peak hour (4:40 – 5:40 p.m.)
      is the time during which the highest traffic demands consistently occur on the roadway system.
      Consistent with recent transportation studies conducted for other projects in the vicinity, this study
      also analyzes the operations of the transportation system during the weekday p.m. peak hour.


      Existing Traffic Conditions
                    All of the study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service during the
                     weekday p.m. peak traffic hour.
                    The City’s Transportation System Plan (TSP) noted two intersections in the vicinity of Block
                     137 with documented crash rates that exceed their critical crash rate. The intersections are
                     A Avenue at State Street and B Avenue at 1st Street. As part of the TSP, the City will monitor
                     these locations to determine if and when mitigation measures are necessary. These

Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                                  December 9, 2013
                                                                                                         Executive Summary


                   intersections are not adjacent to Block 137, therefore the redevelopment proposal is not
                   expected to exacerbate conditions that may be contributing to the crash rates.
                  There are no documented crash patterns or trends at the intersections adjacent to the site.
                   No safety-based mitigation measures are recommended as part of redevelopment of the
                   Block.


Proposed Redevelopment’s Trip Generation Forecasts
                  Redevelopment of Block 137 could generate 90 more p.m. peak hour trips than the site’s
                   existing uses. Today, 130 vehicles enter and exit the driveways during the weekday p.m.
                   peak hour.


Proposed Redevelopment’s Impact on Overall Traffic Conditions (Year 2016)
                  For analysis purposes, existing traffic volumes on A Avenue and State Street were assumed
                   to increase by three percent (i.e. one percent per year) by 2016. Traffic volumes on local
                   streets were assumed to remain stable and unchanged.
                  All study intersections within the immediate vicinity of the site are forecast to operate
                   acceptably per City and State standards during the weekday p.m. peak hour when the site is
                   redeveloped and occupied in 2016 (i.e. the city intersections on A and B Avenues will
                   operate at LOS E or better and the state intersections along State Street will have volume-
                   to-capacity ratios [v/c] less than 1.1). Table 1 summarizes the change in intersection
                   operations resulting from the proposed redevelopment.

                  Traffic demand at the Country Club/Iron Mountain/C Avenue intersection will continue to
                   exceed capacity during the p.m. peak hour and will continue to meter the rate at which
                   eastbound traffic can use A Avenue in the downtown area as traffic volumes increase over

      Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                              December 9, 2013
                                                                                                           Executive Summary


                     eastbound approach during the p.m. peak traffic period because of growth in regional traffic
                     and as many as 25 more vehicles are anticipated from Block 137’s redevelopment. The
                     Transportation System Plan identifies this intersection as exceeding its capacity during the
                     weekday p.m. peak hour and identifies a capital improvement for addressing the over-
                     capacity conditions. This improvement is not scheduled or funded at this time.


      Proposed Redevelopment’s Impact on Evergreen Neighborhood Street Circulation
                    The street system serving the Evergreen Neighborhood, by its design, limits the amount of
                     Block 137-related neighborhood cut-through traffic that could occur. As such, Block 137
                     traffic traveling to and from the north, south and east can be expected to continue relying
                     almost exclusively on 1st and 2nd Streets and A and B Avenues, not Evergreen Neighborhood
                     streets.
                    Intersection turning movement counts conducted during the weekday p.m. peak indicate
                     that today, most drivers traveling between the Block 137/Lakeview Village area and the
                     west use A Avenue rather than Evergreen Road.
                           o At Evergreen Road’s intersection with 2nd Street, 30 eastbound vehicles were
                             observed approaching from the west (half turned left onto 2nd Street toward Block
                             137 and half continued east toward 1st Street). By comparison, a total of 70
                             eastbound vehicles were observed turning from A Avenue onto 1st Street and 2nd
                             Street.
                           o Thirty (30) vehicles on Evergreen Road were observed approaching 2nd Street from
                             the east (20 continued west whereas 10 turned right onto 2nd Street). By
                             comparison, 85 vehicles were observed turning left from 1st Street and 2nd Street to
                             travel west on A Avenue.
                    Assuming traffic patterns stay the same as they are today, the redevelopment of Block 137
                     could generate 41 new weekday p.m. peak hour trips to/from the west (7 outbound and 34
                     inbound to the Block). Based on these same patterns, this could result in 12 more Block 137-
                     related trips eastbound and 2 more westbound on Evergreen Road. Even with the added
                     traffic volumes, the total daily traffic on Evergreen Road is expected to meet the City’s
                     guidelines for local streets (<1,000 vehicles per day).


      Site-Access Operations
                    The redevelopment project will replace nine existing driveways with two driveways.
                    Block 137’s driveway on 2nd Street will serve residents and their guests, not the general
                     public. The driveway design is expected to limit the potential for vehicle queuing that would
                     block or delay pedestrians and provide a clear line of sight for exiting drivers to see
                     approaching pedestrians and vehicles.
                    Block 137’s driveway on 1st Street will be accessible by the general public.

Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                            December 9, 2013
                                                                                                   Executive Summary


              Accessing the 1st Street driveway is not expected to impede the traffic flow on 1st Street or
               Evergreen Road. It is expected to have limited impact on access to the existing Lakeview
               Village driveway. Most turns at Block 137’s 1st Avenue driveway will be right-turns in and
               left-turns out. Right-turns in can be made without delay or conflict except when yielding to
               a pedestrian. Also right-turns in will not impede turns from the Lakeview Village driveway.
               Left-turns exiting the 1st Street driveway will yield to all traffic including traffic exiting the
               Lakeview Village driveway.


Parking Supply and Demand
              The proposed Block 137 parking supply will include 322 residential stalls and 167
               retail/public stalls. The City Code requires a minimum of 297 residential stalls and 136
               retail/public stalls.
              The Lake Oswego Redevelopment Authority (LORA) parking structure agreement calls for a
               minimum of 48 of the on-site public parking stalls to be set aside for retail patrons, tenants
               and employees.
              Approximately five new on-street parking stalls and two new loading zones could be added
               around the perimeter of Block 137 after closing nine existing driveways and replacing them
               with two.
              229 bicycle parking spaces will serve the site, including 219 for the residential uses and 10
               for the retail. This supply exceeds city standards for bicycle parking. City code requires 55
               residential bicycle spaces and 9 retail bicycle spaces.


RECOMMENDATIONS
The findings of this report indicate that the transportation system can adequately and appropriately
serve redevelopment of Block 137. No mitigation measures are needed for the proposed
redevelopment of Block 137 to meet city requirements. Transportation services are adequate to
accommodate the project without modification to the existing infrastructure. However the
investigation identified the following recommendations for future City consideration as they would
provide benefits to the overall transportation system:

              Landscaping, signing, above ground utilities, and pavement/sidewalk details should be
               configured to ensure safe, convenient and efficient driveway operations, keeping in mind
               the ability of drivers to see pedestrians and pedestrians to see approaching vehicles.
              Create additional on-street parking and/or truck loading zones associated with the closure
               of existing driveways serving Block 137.
              Consider reordering the traffic signal phases at A Avenue’s intersection with State Street so
               eastbound left-turns and right-turns proceed at the same time, followed by eastbound

                     right-turns and northbound left-turns. This will help assure that eastbound left-turn queues
                     will not extend into and block the nearest right-turn lane.
                    Explore coordinating A Avenue’s signals at State Street and 1st Street to assure the
                     following:
                           o Westbound traffic will not queue from 1st Street and block the flow of traffic from
                             State Street,
                           o Westbound vehicles turning left from A Avenue onto 1st Street do not queue into
                             the nearest through lane, and

                           o Eastbound traffic is able to access and utilize all of the green time at the State Street
                             intersection.

                    Consider providing manual traffic control at 1st Street’s intersection with the Lakeview
                     Village and Block 137 driveways during major civic events.
                    Consider adding an eastbound STOP sign at the 2nd Street/Evergreen Road intersection, or
                     possibly stopping all three approaches to the intersection. Currently only the westbound
                     approach is STOP controlled.
                    Support the timely implementation of vehicle capacity improving projects identified in the
                     Transportation System Plan, in particular the plan’s proposal for the Country Club/Iron
                     Mountain/C Avenue and State/B Avenue intersections.

      INTRODUCTION
      Evergreen Group LLC is proposing to redevelop the entire block of downtown Lake Oswego surrounded
      by 1St Street, Evergreen Road, 2nd Street and A Avenue. Commonly referred to as Block 137 or the Wizer
      Block, the redevelopment site is expected to consist of:

                    28,000 square feet of ground floor retail and restaurant space,
                    228 residential units,
                    457 underground parking stalls (322 residential and 135 retail),
                    229 on-site bicycle parking spaces (219 residential and 10 retail),
                    5 additional on-street parking spaces, and
                    2 truck loading zones (One on 1st Street and one on 2nd Street).
      The site is currently occupied by a shopping center consisting of approximately 72,700 square feet of
      retail and restaurant space and 171 on-site parking stalls.

      The redevelopment project will replace nine existing driveways with two driveways. Access to the on-
      site residential parking is proposed via a driveway on 2nd Street. Access to the on-site public retail
      parking is proposed via a driveway on 1st Street that will be located across from the existing Lakeview
      Village parking lot access. Construction is expected to begin in 2014 while anticipated build-out and full
      occupancy is expected in 2016.

              Our Lady of the Lake Campus Transportation Impact Analysis (2008)
Data and findings from several of these studies are cited throughout this report and serve as a
previously-established basis for assessing Block 137’s influence on the transportation system.


SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This analysis determines the transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed Block 137
redevelopment. It was prepared in accordance with the City of Lake Oswego’s requirements. The study
intersections and scope of this project were selected in consultation with City staff. The study scope
originally propose in the City’s pre-application memorandum was revised after initial traffic analyses
determined the capacity of certain intersections to serve Block 137’s redevelopment would not be
exceeded. The report considers the intersections nearest Block 137 and intersections that are on
potential paths to/from northbound and southbound State Street. Though not in the immediate vicinity
of Block 137, the report also considers the Country Club/Iron Mountain/C Avenue intersection and how
it effectively “meters” the amount of eastbound traffic that can enter the A Avenue corridor and as a
result assures that signalized intersections along A Avenue will continue operating acceptably. Similarly
the report considers only State Street’s intersections with A and B Avenues because together they
effectively meter how much traffic can move northbound and southbound along State Street and
westbound along A Avenue. The report also considers the on-street parking opportunities between the
lake and B Avenue and State and 4th Streets.


Analysis Period
Consistent with the recent transportation impact analyses conducted for other projects in the vicinity of
Block 137, the weekday p.m. peak traffic hour is the basis for assessing Block 137’s future impact on the
transportation system. Cursory comparison of weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic counts
conducted for this report confirm the most demanding traffic conditions occur during the p.m. peak
hour. The p.m. peak traffic hour was observed to occur between 4:40 and 5:40 p.m.


Study Intersections
The proposed redevelopment’s influence on the performance of the following 8 intersections was
analyzed:

              Country Club/Iron Mountain/C Avenue
              State Street/A Avenue

      This report addresses key transportation considerations involving trip generation, intersection
      performance, and parking as summarized below.


      Block 137 Trip Generation and Assignment
      This report estimates the trip generating characteristics for the proposed redevelopment, specifically:

                    The proposed redevelopment’s trip generation forecast compared to the site’s current trip
                     generation; and
                    The estimated street network distribution of the trips associated with the proposed
                     redevelopment.


      Intersection Performance
      This report analyzes the performance of intersections in the vicinity of the proposed redevelopment for
      five specific cases:

                    Year 2013 existing conditions with the current Block 137 development;

Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                      December 9, 2013
                                                                                                  Introduction



ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Intersection Operations Analysis
Intersection operational analyses presented in this report were performed in accordance with the
procedures stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 1) and level of service was used for
assessing performance of signalized and unsignalized intersections. A description of level of service and
the criteria by which it is determined is presented in Appendix “A”. Appendix “A” also indicates how
level of service is measured and what is generally considered an acceptable range.


Intersection Operations Standards
The City of Lake Oswego has adopted specific level-of-service standards, which are identified in Section
50.02.002.2.d of the City’s Municipal Code. Based on the Code, LOS “E” must be maintained at all study
intersections during the weekday p.m. peak hour. The intersections of A Avenue and State Street and B
Avenue and State Street are on OR-43, a state facility. Being in an ODOT-designated Special
Transportation Area (STA), the state’s threshold for acceptable intersection performance is a volume-
to-capacity ratio (v/c) of 1.1.

The Oregon Highway Plan describes typical STAs as looking like traditional “Main Streets” and are
generally located on both sides of a state highway. The primary objective of an STA is to provide access
to and circulation amongst community activities, businesses and residences and to accommodate
pedestrian, bicycle and transit movement along and across the highway. Direct street connections and
shared on-street parking are encouraged. Local auto, pedestrian, bicycle and transit movements to the
area are generally as important as the through movement of traffic. Traffic speeds are slow, generally
25 miles per hour or lower.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.

Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried the proposed redevelopment site and
surrounding study area in June 2013. At that time, KAI collected information regarding site conditions,
adjacent land uses, existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in the study area.


SITE CONDITIONS AND ADJACENT LAND USES
The proposed site is located within the Lake Oswego Redevelopment Agency’s (LORA) East End Urban
Renewal District and is zoned for commercial and residential uses. The site is currently occupied by a
72,700 square foot shopping center consisting of retail and restaurant space supported by 171 on-site
parking stalls. Nine driveways serve the site, including two driveways on A Street, three driveways on
2nd Street and four driveways on 1st Street.

Residential development borders the site to the west and Millennium Park is to the south. Commercial
and office uses are located to the north and east, including Lakeview Village directly to the east.


TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of existing transportation facilities located adjacent to the
proposed development site and in the site vicinity. Figure 3 illustrates the existing lane configurations
and traffic control devices in place at the study intersections.

Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                           December 9, 2013
                                                                                                  Existing Conditions


Motor Vehicle Facilities
As shown in Table 2, State Street, A Avenue, and Country Club Road are the major arterials within the
site vicinity. Per the City’s Transportation System Plan (TSP), major arterials are primarily intended to
serve through traffic connecting city and county streets. Major Arterials tend to carry a significant
amount of traffic (>20,000 vehicles per day) at moderate to high speeds; however in the case of State
Street and A Avenue, the post speeds are 25 mph and 30 mph respectively.

B Avenue (between State Street and 5th Street) and 5th Street (between A Avenue and B Avenue) are
classified as major collectors. As such, these streets are intended to connect local streets with arterials
as well as provide access to adjacent land uses. Major collectors tend to carry a moderate amount of
traffic (up to 10,000 vehicles per day per the TSP) at low to moderate speeds.

All other streets are classified as local streets. According to the TSP a local street’s primary function is to
provide access to abutting land uses. They are typically relatively low-volume streets (less than 1,000
vehicles per day according to the TSP) but there are cases where abutting or “downstream” land uses
generate more than 1,000 vehicles per day on a local street. An example would be 1st Street between
Evergreen Road and B Avenue where abutting commercial land uses rely on 1 st Street for traffic access.
Another example might be 3rd or 4th Street south of A Avenue where traffic volumes are greatest near A
Avenue but diminish on blocks located farther from A Avenue.


Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Streets in the study area generally have sidewalks on both sides; however, Evergreen Road has sidewalk
only on the north side between 3rd and 4th Streets. Local streets to the west and south of 4th Street and
Evergreen Road have no sidewalks.

Sidewalks on Block 137’s north (A Avenue) and east (1 st Street) frontages are very generous in width
and include street furniture, landscaping and public art. The sidewalks on the south (Evergreen Road)
and west (2nd Street) frontages are relatively narrow, the existing building is located against the back of
sidewalk and there are street trees and tree wells near the curb.

Separate bicycle facilities in the East End Redevelopment District are limited to a single
westbound/uphill bike lane on B Avenue and a bicycle route through the Evergreen Neighborhood is
designated with bicycle/pedestrian-scale signs guiding users to particular destinations. There are
currently a very limited number of bike racks in the vicinity of Block 137. As part of redevelopment,
parking for 229 bicycles will be created on Block 137.


Transit Facilities
Block 137 is served by frequent transit service with two TriMet bus routes serving the site vicinity. Both
bus lines provide service seven days per week with arrival headways averaging 30 minutes and are
described further below (Reference 4).

      TriMet Bus Line 35 provides service between downtown Portland and downtown Oregon City by way of
      State Street, with service to the Lake Oswego transit center on 4th Street. Arrivals are by way of B
      Avenue and departures are by way of A Avenue. Bus line 35 has a stop on Block 137’s A Avenue
      frontage. Service operates on weekdays from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. and on weekends from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. A
      Line 35 bus stop is located on Block 137’s A Avenue frontage.

      TriMet Bus Line 78 provides service from the Lake Oswego Transit Center to Lake Oswego High School
      and Junior High School by way of Country Club Road as well as to the Mountain Park neighborhood and
      Portland Community College Sylvania Campus by way of Kerr Parkway. Service continues on to SW
      Portland destinations, proceeds into Tigard, and ultimately terminates at the Beaverton Transit Center.
      Service operates on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m., on Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and on
      Sundays from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. The Line 78 bus stop at the transit center is located less than 1,000 feet
      from Block 137.


      TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
      Manual turning-movement counts for the following study area intersections were obtained directly
      from the City’s Transportation System Plan Update (2012):

                    1st Street/B Avenue
                    State Street/B Avenue
                    State Street/A Avenue
                    Country Club/Iron Mountain/C Avenue
      The A and B Avenues intersection volumes were adjusted to account for differences where the traffic
      volumes exiting one intersection did not equal the volumes entering the adjacent intersection.

      Turning-movement counts for the intersections on the four corners of Block 137 were obtained in June
      2013 before school ended for the summer:

                    1st Street/A Avenue
                    2nd Street/A Avenue
                    2nd Street/Evergreen Road
                    1st Street/Lakeview Village Driveway
      The Evergreen Road intersection was counted because of its proximity to Block 137 and to assess
      neighborhood traffic circulation patterns that may be associated with existing activity at Block 137,
      Lakeview Village and Millennium Park. The counts on A Avenue confirm current arterial conditions and
      provide a basis for assessing the redevelopment’s impacts on existing intersection conditions nearest
      the project site. The intersections on B Avenue were counted because they are on the likely path of
      Block 137 traffic traveling to and from the north via State Street. The Country Club Rd/Iron Mountain/C
      Avenue intersection is outside the immediate vicinity of the project area but was included in the

analysis to provide a broader context for understanding how traffic moves through the project area. Its
p.m. peak hour traffic volumes and intersection capacity analysis results were taken directly from the
Transportation System Plan.

Block 137’s driveways were also counted to document the traffic activity generated by the current uses
on the site.

Year 2035 forecast turning-movement counts were obtained from the Lake Oswego to Portland Transit
Project Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) (2010). These 2035 volumes do not include the
traffic associated with the Foothills Framework Plan nor do they reflect the influence of any new transit
service on the OR-43 corridor.

The Transportation System Plan Update traffic counts, the Transit DEIS traffic counts and the counts
collected in June all concluded that the p.m. peak hour traffic conditions were more critical than the
a.m. peak hour conditions in determining intersection needs. Like these studies, the analysis of Block
137’s traffic impacts focuses on weekday p.m. peak period conditions. The June counts showed the
hour from 4:40 to 5:40 p.m. had the greatest number of motor vehicles.

Figure 4 provides a summary of the turning-movement counts and their sources. Appendix “B” contains
the traffic count worksheets used in this study.


Current Levels of Service
Figure 4 summarizes the weekday p.m. peak hour level-of-service analysis for the study intersections
under existing traffic conditions. As shown, all of the intersections in the immediate study area
currently operate at acceptable levels of service. The Country Club/Iron Mountain/C Avenue
intersection is outside the immediate vicinity of the project area but was included because it currently
“meters” the amount of westbound traffic that can enter the downtown area, and as a result assures
that the downtown intersections perform acceptably. This intersection has been identified during the
City’s Transportation System Plan update process as warranting special attention and mitigation
measures have been proposed at this location as part of city-based capital improvement projects. The
City’s capital improvement project would include realigning the two northerly legs of this intersection,
combining the north leg of Iron Mountain and Bayberry into one approach and removing the
landscaped area. Appendix “C” provides the existing conditions level-of-service worksheets.

Intersection Crash History
The crash history of the intersections on the perimeter of Block 137 was reviewed in an effort to
identify potential safety issues that should be addressed as part of this development. The Oregon
Department of Transportation (ODOT) provided crash records for the study intersections for the three-
year period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011. Table 3 summarizes the crash history of
the study intersections over the three-year reporting period.

Property Damage Only


The information provided in Table 3 indicates there are no crash patterns or trends at the intersections
adjacent to Block 137 that require mitigation associated with this project. Appendix “D” contains the
crash data obtained from ODOT.

Two intersections in the vicinity of, but not adjacent to, Block 137 were identified in the City’s
Transportation System Plan as having crash rates warranting further review. Based on reported crashes
between 2007 and 2010, A Avenue’s intersection with State Street and B Avenue’s intersection with 1st
Street have ratios of reported crashes-to-traffic volume that warrant further consideration in the
Transportation System Plan. City staff will monitor these locations to determine if and when mitigation
measures are necessary.

TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The transportation impact analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system is expected to
operate in the year the proposed Block 137 redevelopment is scheduled to be complete, 2016. The
impact of traffic generated by the proposed Block 137 redevelopment during the typical weekday p.m.
peak hour was examined as follows:

              Year 2016 background traffic conditions (with the existing Block 137 development) were
               analyzed at the study intersections. No other private development or public transportation
               projects that might introduce new traffic volumes or new roadway operations are expected
               in the project vicinity before 2016. For analysis purposes, traffic volumes on A Avenue and
               State Street were assumed to increase by three percent (i.e. one percent per year). Traffic
               volumes on local streets were assumed to remain stable and unchanged.
              Site-generated trips were estimated assuming full occupancy of the redeveloped site. The
               number of p.m. peak hour and average daily total trips were estimated using nationally-
               recognized procedures and trip characteristics for Block 137’s anticipated uses.
              A trip-distribution pattern for the site-generated trips was developed for the site and
               applied to the street network.
              Year 2016 total traffic conditions (with full build-out and occupancy of the proposed Block
               137 redevelopment) were analyzed at the study intersections and site driveways during the
               weekday p.m. peak hour.
              Year 2035 background traffic conditions for State Street’s intersections with A and B Avenue
               were obtained from the Lake Oswego to Portland Transit Project’s Transportation Technical
               Report. Growth rates for the other study intersections were developed from traffic volumes
               for these two intersections.
              Year 2035 transportation-system conditions during the weekday p.m. peak period were
               assessed with the proposed Block 137 redevelopment’s new trips applied to the street
               network.


YEAR 2016 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The year 2016 background traffic conditions analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation
system will operate if Block 137 were not redeveloped and current trips associated with Block 137
continued to use the study area’s transportation network. This analysis increased the existing traffic
volumes on A Avenue and State Street using a general growth factor of 3.0% to account for continued
regional growth between 2013 and 2016. This assumed rate of growth could prove to be higher than
actually occurs, given traffic volumes have been declining or remaining the same in recent years.

Figure 5 illustrates the resulting year 2016 background traffic volumes during the weekday p.m. peak
hour.

      Year 2016 Level-of-Service Analysis
      Figure 5 also summaries the level-of-service analysis for the study intersections under year 2016
      background traffic conditions. As shown, all of the study intersections in the immediate vicinity of Block
      137 are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Traffic
      demands at the Country Club/Iron Mountain/C Avenue intersection will continue to exceed capacity
      during this time of the day. Using the assumed annual growth rate, eastbound p.m. peak hour traffic
      volumes on Country Club could increase by 25 vehicles by 2016. Appendix “E” contains the year 2016
      background traffic level-of-service worksheets.


      PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT PLAN
      Evergreen Group LLC is proposing to redevelop Block 137 into a multi-story building with 28,000 square
      feet of ground floor retail and restaurant space and 228 residential units. Site development will be
      supported by 457 underground parking stalls (322 stalls for Block 137 resident use and 135 stalls to
      support retail and general public use) and 229 on-site bicycle parking spaces (219 spaces allocated for
      Block 137 resident use and 10 to support the site retail uses). Approximately 5 new on-street parking
      spaces and two loading zone spaces will also be added to the on-street system.

      The existing site driveways will be consolidated and closed, vacating all driveway access to A Street and
      replacing the existing driveways on 1st Street and 2nd Street with a single driveway on each roadway.
      The 1st Street driveway will provide access to the on-site retail parking area and will be aligned with the
      existing Lakeview Village parking lot driveway. The 2nd Street driveway will be for the exclusive use of
      the Block 137 residents and their guests.


      Trip Generation
      A trip-generation estimate was prepared for the proposed Block 137 redevelopment based on
      information provided in the standard reference manual, Trip Generation, 9th Edition, published by the
      Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE Reference 5). The internal and pass-by trip rates were also
      obtained from Trip Generation, 9th Edition. For reference purposes, internal trips are defined as trips
      that occur between neighboring uses after a car arrives and is parked. Within downtown Lake Oswego,
      there are multiple retail, recreational and residential uses that residents and patrons of Block 137 can
      visit during their trip to Block 137; these uses are located in close enough proximity to allow walking
      between destinations, thereby considered as “internal.” Pass-by trips are secondary trips where drivers
      might stop at Block 137 while on the way to their primary destination, such as stopping at a retail use
      on their way home. A pass-by trip generates two site-related trips, an arrival trip and a departure trip,
      but generates no new trip to the broader street network.

      Table 4 summarizes the weekday daily and weekday p.m. peak hour trips estimated for the proposed
      redevelopment. It should be noted that the anticipated land uses and their associated trip generation
      rates were selected to result in a conservative higher-than-likely number of trips to provide a
      reasonable worst-case assessment of the traffic impacts. Additional details are provided in the narrative
      below Table 4. All daily trips have been rounded to the nearest ten trips while peak hour trips have
      been rounded to the nearest five.

          Daily estimate is based on 10 times the PM peak hour trips.

      To provide a reasonable “worst-case” analysis, this study applies the apartment trip generation
      information under ITE Code 220 (Apartment) instead of ITE Code 223 (Mid-Rise Apartment), which has
      a lower trip generation rate. Although the redevelopment project meets the mid-rise apartment (ITE
      223) definition (ITE describes mid-rise apartments as “apartments … that have between three and 10
      levels/floors) Code 220 was chosen because it yields a higher estimation of trip generation than Code
      223 (i.e., 0.62 p.m. peak hour trips per unit compared to 0.39 trips per unit).

Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                           December 9, 2013
                                                                                      Transportation Impact Analysis


ITE defines specialty retail center (ITE Code 826) as “Specialty retail centers are generally small trip
shopping centers that contain a variety of retail shops and specialize in quality apparel, hard goods and
services, such as real estate offices, dance studios, florists and small restaurants.” This land use
category includes the sorts of retail shops common to Lakeview Village. It was also a recognized land
use category used in the City-sponsored 2010 North Anchor study.

ITE defines quality restaurant (ITE Code 931) as “This land use consists of high quality, full-service eating
establishments with typical duration of stay of at least one hour. Quality restaurants generally do not
serve breakfast; some do not serve lunch; all serve dinner. This type of restaurant often requests and
sometimes requires reservations and is generally not a chain. Patrons commonly wait to be seated, are
served by a waiter/waitress, order from menus and pay for meals after they eat. While some of the
study sites have lounge or bar facilities (serving alcoholic beverages), they are ancillary to the
restaurant.” Trip generation forecasts for the redevelopment’s quality restaurant space was based on
one-third of the total proposed ground floor retail space being allocated to quality restaurant. This
proportion is comparable to the restaurant-to-specialty retail proportion at Lakeview Village. As can be
seen in Table 4, quality restaurants generate more trips than specialty retail and tend to generate a
smaller percentage of internal trips than specialty retail, resulting in more forecasted trips per floor
area than specialty retail.

Table 4 shows that the proposed development is estimated to generate approximately 130 (140 total,
minus 10 internal) apartment-related trips and 90 commercial-related trips (55 specialty retail plus 70
quality restaurant, minus 35 total internal trips) during the p.m. peak hour. The apartment trips will use
the site’s 2nd Street driveway. The commercial trips will generally use the site’s 1st Street driveway.

Over an entire typical weekday, it is estimated that the proposed redevelopment’s driveways will see a
total of 2,580 trips (entering and exiting), double the approximately 1,300 trips per day currently
coming to and leaving Block 137. Approximately 39% of the commercial-related trips (excluding internal
trips), 35 during the p.m. peak hour and 470 during a typical weekday, can be expected to be pass-by
trips stopping at Block 137 while on the way to other destinations. The other 61% of the commercial-
related trips to and from the site will be trips whose primary destination is Block 137. All apartment
trips will be new trips resulting from the introduction of residences to the site for the first time.

The redevelopment is estimated to generate an additional 90 trips above the existing Block 137
driveway traffic counted during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Information on the p.m. peak hour use of
each Block 137 driveway is provided in Appendix C.


Site Trip Distribution/Trip Assignment
The future trips to and from Block 137 were distributed onto the study area roadway system according
to the existing traffic entering and exiting the vicinity of Block 137.

Existing p.m. peak hour traffic volumes from Figure 4 were used to estimate the general traffic patterns
within the vicinity of Block 137. The estimate was further adjusted to account for Block 137’s new uses

      after redevelopment. It was ultimately estimated that approximately 43 percent of the site’s traffic
      could come and go to the west, 43 percent south and 12 percent north. This distribution of traffic was
      used to allocate Block 137’s residential and commercial trips onto the street network.

      Figure 6 illustrates the estimated trip distribution pattern for the 220 vehicles estimated to use Block
      137’s driveways during the p.m. peak hour. As shown, the trips were added to the major arterials and
      collectors, not local neighborhood streets. This was done to add as much of the site’s traffic to
      intersections whose future capacities may be in question.


      YEAR 2016 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
      The year 2016 total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area’s transportation system will
      operate after adding the traffic generated by the proposed Block 137 redevelopment. The year 2016
      background traffic volumes for the weekday p.m. peak hour were combined with the site-generated
      traffic to arrive at the total traffic volumes shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 also reflects the relocation of
      Block 137’s public/commercial trips to the 1st Street public parking driveway and the addition of
      residential trips to the 2nd Street driveway.


      Year 2016 Intersection Level of Service
      Figure 7 summarizes the level-of-service analysis for the study intersections under year 2016 total
      traffic conditions. As shown, all of the study intersections in the immediate vicinity of Block 137 are
      expected to operate at acceptable levels of service during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Traffic
      demands at the C Ave/Country Club Rd/Iron Mountain Blvd intersection will continue to exceed
      capacity during this time of the day. Appendix “F” contains the year 2016 total traffic level-of-service
      worksheets.

Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                          December 9, 2013
                                                                                     Transportation Impact Analysis


Year 2016 Queuing Analysis
Vehicle queuing lengths were calculated for critical lanes at the study intersections. The calculations
were based on 2016 weekday p.m. peak hour conditions when the Block 137 redevelopment is
complete and assumed to be fully occupied. The calculations identify a p.m. peak hour queue length
that will not be exceeded 95 percent of the time. The findings are as follows:

              A Avenue’s westbound left-turn lanes at 1st and 2nd Street have calculated 95th-percentile
               queues less than the available left-turn lane storage.
              A Avenue’s westbound through lane queues approaching 1st Street have calculated 95th-
               percentile queues that will not reach back to State Street.
              A Avenue’s eastbound left-turn and right-turn calculated 95th-percentile queue lengths are
               already greater than the available lane storage without the influence of Block 137’s
               redevelopment, but are not expected to increase.
              State Street’s calculated 95th-percentile southbound through queue length will not increase
               after Block 137 redevelops. However, the 95th-percentile queue will be greater than the
               distance to the adjacent intersection at B Street. Queues in the two southbound through
               lanes are calculated to be 9 car lengths longer than the distance between A and B Avenues.
               Because of these p.m. peak hour conditions southbound drivers destined for Block 137
               could choose to use B Avenue, 1st Street and 2nd Street instead of A Avenue.
              State Street’s exclusive northbound left-turn is already unable to accommodate the demand
               even without the influence of Block 137’s redevelopment. The 95th-percentile queue length
               is calculated to increase by one car length after Block 137 redevelops. That increased queue
               will be accommodated in the adjacent northbound through-left combination lane.
Appendix “F” contains the year 2016 queuing analysis results.


YEAR 2035 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
Though typically considered only in land use zone change applications, at the City’s request, this report
considers the proposed redevelopment’s impact on traffic conditions in the region’s horizon planning
year of 2035. Because the Block 137 redevelopment plan’s uses are allowed by the base zoning, this
portion of the report is not needed to address City Code requirements and is for informational
purposes only.

Year 2035 conditions identified in the Lake Oswego to Portland Transit Project’s Transportation
Technical Report (Reference 7) served as the basis for analyzing Block 137’s redevelopment impact on
key intersections in 2035. The Transit Project’s technical report forecasted p.m. peak traffic volumes at
intersections along State Street. The technical report’s “no build” intersection volumes forecasted for
State Street/A Avenue were used to estimate the 2035 volumes at A Avenue’s intersections with 1st and

      Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                              December 9, 2013
                                                                                               Transportation Impact Analysis


      Assuming the 2035 model’s land use assumptions and resulting intersection volumes are based on
      existing Block 137 traffic activity, the redevelopment plan’s additional p.m. peak hour traffic was
      distributed onto the street network and the performance of the study intersections was evaluated.

      Page 77 of the Lake Oswego to Portland Transit Project’s Transportation Technical Report concludes
      that the volume-to-capacity ratio at the intersections of A Avenue and State Street and B Avenue and
      State Street will far exceed the v/c=1.1 threshold for acceptability due to regional growth between
      2013 and 2035. The intersection at A Avenue is forecast to have a v/c ratio of 1.95. The intersection at B
      Avenue will have a ratio of 1.32. To-date the Transportation System Plan has not identified a capital
      improvement to address the future capacity needs at A Avenue’s intersection with State Street. The
      Transportation System Plan proposes adding a southbound right-turn lane to help address future
      capacity needs at B Avenue. Providing an exclusive turn lane will allow southbound right-turning
      vehicles to go at the same time as B Avenue traffic. It will also provide a lane for right-turners to yield to
      crossing pedestrians without delaying southbound through traffic.


      NEIGHBORHOOD CIRCULATION/SITE-ACCESS OPERATIONS
      The land uses and street network in the immediate vicinity of Block 137 were evaluated to assess
      existing conditions and how they might change when the site redevelops. The following topics are
      addressed:

                    Proposed Block 137 site design and vehicular access
                    Existing neighborhood land uses
                    Existing and future neighborhood street network and traffic circulation
      For purposes of this evaluation, the neighborhood study area is bounded by 1 st Street on the east, A
      Avenue on the north, 5th Street on the west and Lake Bay Court on the south.


      Proposed Block 137 Site Design and Vehicular Access
      As can be seen in Figure 8, Block 137 is located near the boundary between the East End District and
      the Evergreen Neighborhood. The East End District is zoned for a combination of office, residential and
      retail uses. Commercial and office uses are currently located along A Avenue, along 1st Street and along
      the east side of 2nd Street on Block 137. The Evergreen Neighborhood is a blend of apartments,
      townhomes and single family residences. The apartments and townhomes are located nearest the East
      End District and the single family residences are located farthest from the East End District.

      Block 137 Redevelopment – Transportation Impact Analysis                                              December 9, 2013
                                                                                               Transportation Impact Analysis


      Block 137’s proposed redevelopment design and parking facilities complement this confluence of the
      Evergreen Neighborhood and the East End District by:

                    Locating retail activity only in the ground floor spaces that face other existing retail uses
                     along A Avenue and 1st Street,
                    Limiting on-site general public parking access to 1st Street only,
                    Locating residential units to face toward Millennium Park along Evergreen Road,
                    Eliminating existing commercial uses along 2nd Street and introducing residential uses to
                     face the existing residences on the opposite side of 2nd Street, and
                    Restricting 2nd Street’s on-site parking access to only residents and their guests.


      Existing Neighborhood Land Uses
      Previously redeveloped properties surround Block 137. Block 137 is the only property south of A
      Avenue that has not redeveloped. As can be seen in Figure 8 the following properties surround Block
      137:
                    Millennium Park, located immediately to the south;
                    Lakeview Village, located immediately to the east; and
                    Nine residential townhouses, located on the west side of 2nd Street;

      Other neighborhood land uses include the following:
                    Commercial and office buildings, located along A Avenue;
                    Apartments, located to the southwest;
                    Townhomes, located to the west; and
                    Single-family residences located farther to the west and south.


      Existing and Future Neighborhood Street Network and Traffic Circulation
      The layout of the neighborhood street network helps limit East End District traffic impacts on the
      Evergreen Neighborhood. Based on existing traffic patterns, Block 137 traffic traveling to and from the
      north, south and east is expected to continue to rely almost exclusively on 1st and 2nd Streets and A and
      B Avenues and not Evergreen Neighborhood streets.

      The following discusses traffic circulation to/from the west during the p.m. peak traffic hour, when
      drivers may be most likely to use Evergreen Road to access Block 137 and Lakeview Village instead of A
      Avenue.

                                                                                    Transportation Impact Analysis


Existing Block 137 Traffic to/from the West

Intersection turning movement counts conducted during the p.m. peak hour indicate drivers coming to
and leaving the Block 137/Lakeview Village area currently use A Avenue more than Evergreen Road.
              At Evergreen Road’s intersection with 2nd Street, 30 eastbound vehicles were observed
               approaching from the west (half turned left onto 2nd Street and half continued east toward
               1st Street). By comparison, a total of 70 eastbound vehicles were observed turning from A
               Avenue onto 1st Street and 2nd Street.
              Thirty (30) vehicles on Evergreen Road were observed approaching 2nd Street from the
               east. Twenty continued west. Ten turned right onto 2nd Street). By comparison, 85 vehicles
               were observed turning left from 1st Street and 2nd Street to travel west on A Avenue.
              The relatively low traffic volumes on Evergreen Road are consistent with the local street
               designation.
              Conditions on Evergreen Road and A Avenue could explain why more drivers use A Avenue
               to travel westbound from the Block 137/Lakeview Village area. Westbound travel via
               Evergreen Road is limited to the blocks between 1st and 4th Streets. At the intersection of
               Evergreen Road and 4th Street, DO NOT ENTER signs prevent drivers from traveling any
               farther west. Westbound A Avenue operates well during all hours and may always be a
               faster westbound path than Evergreen Road.
              Evergreen Road’s lower eastbound traffic volumes could be due to a perception that
               accessing Block 137 and Lakeview Village is quicker and most direct via A Avenue.
Future Block 137 Traffic to/from the West

The redeveloped Block 137 can be expected to generate approximately 41 new p.m. peak hour trips to
and from the west (calculations using information from Table 4 and Figure 6a determined that 45% of
the site’s 90 new p.m. peak hour trips will travel to and from the west). This includes 7 traveling to the
west and 34 traveling from the west. If the new Block 137-related traffic volumes continue to distribute
in the same proportions as current traffic conditions, 12 more Block 137-related cars might travel
eastbound on Evergreen Road and 2 more Block 137-related cars might travel westbound on Evergreen
Road during the p.m. peak hour.


PARKING ANALYSIS
The parking analysis describes existing on-street and on-site parking conditions. It describes the amount
and location of available on-street parking and reports how the parking is used during particular times
of the day. The information is based on field observations conducted during July 2013 as well as the
City’s Parking Resource Assessment Downtown Parking Study (2010).

                                                                                         Transportation Impact Analysis


      Neighborhood On-Street Parking Supply and Demand
      Figure 9 illustrates the on-street parking capacity and the parking duration limits for the streets in the
      study area. The figure illustrates the mid-day peak demand for on-street parking as well as the demand
      at midnight, after commercial business hours when only residents are likely to be using on-street
      parking.

      The Parking Resource Assessment Downtown Parking Study identified 2:00-3:00 p.m. as the peak on-
      street parking period on typical weekdays. During this time, approximately half of the unlimited
      duration parking was observed to be in use. Parking utilization was highest in the vicinities of Block 137
      (Evergreen Road, 1st Street and 2nd Street) and the City Hall block (Evergreen Road and 3rd Street).
      Usage in front of the nearest single-family homes (on Lake Bay Court and 4th Street) was observed to be
      light.

      During the late evening, after business hours, occupancy of the unlimited duration parking was
      observed to occur primarily in front of the townhomes and the apartments. The Evergreen Road
      parking next to Millennium Park, the 2nd Street parking along Block 137 and the parking around the City
      Hall block was nearly vacant.

      The occupancy of unlimited duration parking spaces is of particular interest because of the potential for
      on-street parking to be used by retail and office employees as well as residents during business hours.
      The findings from field observations confirm that unlimited duration parking around Block 137 and
      around the City Hall block is well occupied during the business day but unused parking opportunities
      were observed on all streets during both inventory periods.


      Future Block 137 On-Street Parking Demand
      On-site residential parking will exceed the code-required minimum by 25 stalls (297 required and 322
      provided). This additional parking should help reduce the potential for on-street parking by Block 137
      residents and their guests.

      On-street parking in unlimited duration parking spaces could increase during the business day after
      Block 137 redevelops. The number of new Block 137 business-related parked cars is not predictable but
      the following summarizes the approximate number of unlimited duration parking spaces currently
      available for use near Block 137:

               6 stalls on 2nd Street between A Avenue and Evergreen Road (4 unoccupied, plus 2 new stalls
                after existing driveways are closed),
               9 stalls on Evergreen Road between 1st and 3rd Streets, and
               16 stalls on 3rd Street between A Avenue and Lake Bay Court.

      Approximately 31 unlimited duration parking stalls should be available to serve additional business day
      parking. It should be noted the number of available parking stalls could be greater than 31 if existing
      Block 137 businesses are currently generating on-street parking.

                                                                                       Transportation Impact Analysis


Future Block 137 On-Street Parking Opportunities
Approximately five new on-street parking stalls could be added around the perimeter of Block 137 in
conjunction with site redevelopment after existing site driveways are closed. Figure 10 illustrates where
the following on-street parking changes could be made as part of the proposed redevelopment:

              On A Avenue, close 2 existing driveways and replace with curb for 2 additional parked
               vehicles.
              On 1st Street, close 3 of 4 existing driveways. Create 3 additional angle-parking stalls and
               turn 2 existing parallel parking stalls and an adjacent closed driveway into a truck loading
               zone.
              On 2nd Street, close 2 of 3 existing driveways and replace with curb for 2 additional parallel-
               parked vehicles and 1 loading zone to support Block 137’s residences.


Block 137 On-Street Truck Loading Zone Opportunities
With the assistance of City staff, two on-street truck loading zone opportunities were identified on the
perimeter of Block 137. One would be located on the west side of 1 st Street immediately south of A
Avenue. The other location would be on 2nd Street to assist those moving into and out of Block 137’s
residences. The identified loading zones have the following benefits:

              The loading zone locations provide a reliable and assigned loading location which could help
               discourage the use of residential streets for deliveries. To access the loading zones, drivers
               would tend to circulate clockwise around Block 137 using 1st Street when arriving and 2nd
               Street when leaving (scheduled deliveries could be directed to use this route).
              The proposed truck loading zone on 1st Street would be especially convenient for delivery
               drivers. By providing a loading zone immediately upon entering onto 1st Street, delivery
               trucks can be quickly and simply maneuvered into place.
              If desired, the loading zones could serve the dual purpose of truck loading during certain
               hours and general parking during the remaining hours.


Block 137 On-Site Parking
The proposed redevelopment’s onsite parking will exceed the City code-derived minimum number of
parking stalls. A total of 322 residential parking stalls are proposed while a minimum of 297 are
required by Code. Similarly, 167 total public parking stalls are proposed to serve the retail area where a
minimum of 136 are required by Code. The Block 137 Project Development Agreement between the
Lake Oswego Redevelopment Agency and Evergreen Group, LLC provides guidance on the management
of on-site public parking. It prescribes that 48 of the 135 public parking stalls be reserved during the
hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday for tenants, employees and patrons of the
retail uses.

                                                                                                    Recommendations




RECOMMENDATIONS
The findings of this report indicate that the transportation system can adequately and appropriately
serve redevelopment of Block 137. No mitigation measures are needed for the proposed
redevelopment of Block 137 to meet city requirements. Transportation services are adequate to
accommodate the project without modification to the existing infrastructure. However the
investigation identified the following recommendations for future City consideration as they would
provide benefits to the overall transportation system:

              Landscaping, signing, above ground utilities, and pavement/sidewalk details should be
               configured to ensure safe, convenient and efficient driveway operations, keeping in mind
               the ability of drivers to see pedestrians and pedestrians to see approaching vehicles.
              Create additional on-street parking and/or truck loading zones associated with the closure
               of seven of the existing driveways serving Block 137.
              Consider modifying the traffic signal phases at A Avenue’s intersection with State Street so
               eastbound left-turns and right-turns proceed at the same time, followed by eastbound
               right-turns and northbound left-turns. This will help assure that eastbound left-turn queues
               will not extend into and block the nearest right-turn lane.
              Explore coordinating A Avenue’s signals at State Street and 1st Street to assure the
               following:
                     o Westbound traffic will not queue from 1st Street and block the flow of traffic from
                       State Street,
                     o Westbound vehicles turning left from A Avenue onto 1st Street do not queue into
                       the nearest through lane, and
                     o Eastbound traffic is able to access and utilize all of the green time at the State Street
                       intersection.
              Consider providing manual traffic control at 1st Street’s intersection with the Lakeview
               Village and Block 137 driveways during major civic events.
              Consider adding an eastbound STOP sign at the 2nd Street/Evergreen Road intersection, or
               possibly stopping all three approaches to the intersection.
              Support the timely implementation of vehicle capacity improving projects identified in the

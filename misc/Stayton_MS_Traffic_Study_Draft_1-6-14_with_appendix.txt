CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
This report evaluates the transportation impacts for the proposed site improvements at Stayton Middle 
School located along Shaff Road in Stayton, Oregon. Improved site access, internal circulation, and 
parking are proposed for the school site to reduce congestion and provide adequate parking supply to 
meet the current demand (see appendix for proposed site plan). This evaluation includes existing 
transportation conditions, trip generation and distribution, future conditions, and transportation 
impacts within the study area. The purpose of this report is to determine mitigation measures to offset 
the any traffic impacts associated with the proposed site modification. It should be noted that no 
increased student levels are expected with the site modifications.  

Study Area
The study area is shown in Figure 1 including the existing driveway and parking lot configuration. Based 
on discussions with City of Stayton and Marion County staff,1 one existing intersection was selected for 
analysis as well as the two existing access points to the school: 
             Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue 
             Shaff Road/West Project Access 
             Shaff Road/East Project Access

Traffic impacts were evaluated at the study intersections for the weekday a.m. (7 a.m. to 9 a.m.) and 
midday (2 p.m. to 4 p.m.) peak hours, which correspond with school drop off and pick up times. The 
impact analysis includes trip generation, trip distribution, and future traffic operating conditions. Table 1 
identifies key study area and transportation analysis characteristics.

Project Site

    Existing Vehicle Access Points                        Two existing access points (one full access and one restricted bus
                                                          entrance only access)

    Proposed Site Improvements                            Improved site access, internal circulation, and parking.
                                                          Improvements include a total of three access points: one ingress
                                                          access; one full access aligned with Gardner Avenue, and one bus
                                                          egress only.

    Proposed Project Trips                                No additional trip generation is anticipated as part of this project.
                                                          However, vehicles that currently stop along Shaff Road and Gardner
                                                          Avenue to drop off or pick up students are assumed to enter the
                                                          improved school site.
 
Traffic Impact
To determine the impacts from the proposed project at the study intersections, traffic operating 
conditions were analyzed at the study intersections for the following scenarios: 
             2013 Existing Conditions ­ a.m. and midday 
             2014 Project Traffic Conditions ­ a.m. and midday 

The a.m. and midday scenarios were selected to analyze the peak periods of the school. The 2014 
scenario was selected since it is the anticipated year of completion for the site improvements. For future 
2014 background volumes, a 2% annual growth was considered for traffic along Shaff Road and Gardner 
Avenue (the Stayton TSP assumed a 1.4% per year growth for the Shaff Road vicinity2), however, as 
previously discussed, there is not expected to be an increase in traffic associated with Stayton Middle 
School.

2013 Existing Operating Conditions
Existing traffic operations at the study intersections were determined for the a.m. and midday peak 
hours based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology.3 All intersections are twoway stop 
controlled. The estimated delay, LOS, and V/C ratio of each study intersection is shown in Table 2. As 
shown, all study intersections currently meet operating standards. It should be noted that during the 
a.m. peak dropoff, there was considerable delay observed for which is consistent with the Level of 
Service "E" operations shown.

       V/C = Volume-to-Capacity Ratio of Worst Movement
 
Parking, Access and Site Modifications
The proposed site modifications will include additional parking and improved access and internal 
circulation. The eastern access (currently a bus entrance only) would serve ingress movements for buses, 
teachers, and parents. Parents can then loop through the drop off area while buses and teachers will 
continue straight. The teachers will access a new a teacher parking lot, while buses will drive past the 
parking lot to a loading zone on the north side of the school. The buses will then exit the school through 
a bus exit only driveway at the west end of the school property. A new access will be created across 
from Gardner Avenue that will provide access to a visitor/parent parking lot and will be used for all 
teachers and parents to exit the school. A site plan is included in the appendix for additional details.  

2014 Future Intersection Operations
Future traffic operations at the study intersections were determined for the a.m. and midday peak hours 
based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology.4 The study intersection operating conditions 
for the year 2014 scenario are listed in Table 3. As shown, the Shaff Road/Gardner AvenueSchool Access 
intersection would not meet the desired operating standards based on the proposed lane configuration. 
The minor street left turn would be estimated to have a 56.8 seconds/vehicle delay which is level of 
service "F" (>50 seconds/vehicle is the LOS E/F threshold).

Project Mitigation Summary
Future 2014 intersection analysis identified failing intersection operations at the proposed school access 
across from Gardner Avenue. The failing movement at this intersection is the southbound left turn 
movement from Stayton Middle School during the a.m. peak hour, which would operate at LOS "F" and 
have a v/c ratio of 0.93.  
In addition to the failing operations, the proposed lane configuration would not properly align with the 
existing lanes on the northbound Gardner Avenue approach. The south leg of this intersection (Gardner 
Avenue) has single northbound and southbound lanes with bike lanes on both sides. By including a 
southbound leftturn lane, it would not be possible to align both the northbound and southbound 
through lanes without modification to the south leg of the intersection. 
The following options should be considered to improve alignment and operations at the Shaff 
Road/Gardner AvenueSchool Access.  

Restriping Northbound Gardner Approach
Installing a left turn lane out of the project access opposite Gardner Avenue is critical to minimize delay 
of vehicles exiting the school in the morning peak period. As previously mentioned, this left turn lane 
would not align with the northbound approach from Gardner Avenue. Restriping the northbound 
approach to include leftturn lane would allow the northbound and southbound through movements to 
align as necessary. This would also reduce delay and queuing for northbound traffic on Gardner Avenue. 
Gardner Avenue has a 40foot crosssection that includes two 14foot travel lanes and two 6foot bike 
lanes. A northbound leftturn lane could be installed by ending the northbound bike lane in advance of 
the intersection and restriping the south leg. This would require cyclists to share a travel lane with 
vehicles or walk their bikes along the sidewalk and use the marked crossing along Shaff Road.  
If removal of the bike lane is not desired by the City and County, the south leg could be restriped to 
include two 5foot bike lanes, two 11foot travel lanes and an 8foot striped transition area in the 
middle. This striping option would meet the transitional requirements of the MUTCD.

Peak Hour Spreading
Existing traffic counts identified a peak hour factor (PHF) of 0.62 at the Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue 
intersection during the a.m. peak hour, which is consistent with the typical peak for an intersection 
adjacent to a school. The PHF is used to quantify the increase in traffic volumes during the highest 15
minute interval within the peak hour. A low PHF such as this is indicative of a high 15minute peak in 
traffic volumes. Because intersection operations are based on the worst 15minute interval, changes in 
the PHF can significantly impact intersection operations at the project driveways.  
If the PHF at this intersection was increased to 0.65, the intersection would meet operating standards 
without further mitigation (LOS "E"). While some spreading will naturally occur as parents change driving 
habits to limit incurred delay, it is unclear whether a PHF of 0.65 or greater will be achieved. There are 
several management options the North Santiam School District could consider to encourage peak hour 
spreading that include developing a plan to vary the class times based on grade.  

Shaff Road On-Street Loading Zone
Another option to reducing congestion at this intersection would be to provide an additional student 
drop off and pick up area along Shaff Road (similar to what exists today). This would reduce the number 
of vehicles entering and exiting the school site during peak conditions, thereby reducing congestion at 
school access. The City of Stayton has future plans for bike lanes on Shaff Road that would conflict with 
the onstreet loading zone once Shaff Road is improved as planned. 
Further discussion between Marion County, the City of Stayton, and the school district will be needed to 
determine if the unmitigated operations are acceptable or what the preferred solution should include.

CHAPTER 2: EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter documents existing study area conditions, including the existing school information, study 
area roadway network, existing traffic volumes and operations, school traffic observations, and collision 
analysis. Supporting details (i.e. traffic counts and level of service calculations) are provided in the 
Appendix. 

Existing School Information
Stayton Middle School currently an existing intermediate and middle school with 566 students and is 
located at the intersection of Shaff Road and Gardner Avenue along Stayton's northern urban growth 
boundary (UGB). The school starts at 7:55 a.m. with the final period ending at 2:55 p.m. The school bell 
schedule is attached in the appendix. 

Study Area Roadway Network
Key study area roadways are listed in Table 4 with functional classifications and important 
characteristics. Functional classifications are provided in the Stayton Transportation System Plan (TSP).5 
Shaff Road is currently under Marion County Jurisdiction while Gardner Avenue is City of Stayton 
Jurisdiction.

    Within study area, speeds along Shaff Road reduced to 20 mph during school hours.



Existing Traffic Volumes and Operations
Existing p.m. peak hour traffic operations were analyzed at the following study intersections: 
             Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue 
             Shaff Road/West Project Access 
             Shaff Road/East Project Access 

To perform the intersection analysis, traffic counts were collected during the a.m. (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) 
and midday (2:00 to 4:00 p.m.) peak periods on December 4th and 5th, 2013. The traffic counts coincide 
with the school start time of 7:55 a.m. and end time of 2:55 p.m. The peak hour traffic volumes analyzed 
under existing conditions are shown in Figure 2, with the detailed traffic counts included in the appendix. 
It should be noted that the p.m. peak hour analysis as referenced in this study correlates to the 2:00 to 
4:00 p.m. school release period.

The purpose of intersection analysis is to ensure that the transportation network remains within desired 
performance levels as required by City code. Intersections are the focus of the analysis because they are 
the controlling bottlenecks of traffic flow and the ability of a roadway system to carry traffic efficiently is 
nearly always diminished in their vicinity. 
Before the analysis results of the study intersections are presented, discussion is provided for two 
important analysis issues: intersection performance measures (definitions of typical measures) and 
required operating standards (as specified by the agency with roadway jurisdiction). 

Intersection Performance Measures
Level of service (LOS) ratings and volumetocapacity (V/C) ratios are two commonly used performance 
measures that provide a good picture of intersection operations. In addition, they are often 
incorporated into agency mobility standards. 
 
 
Stayton Middle School Traffic Study Report                                                         January 2014 
North Santiam School District                                                                            Page 7 
                                                                                                                                         


             Level of service (LOS): A "report card" rating (A through F) based on the average delay 
             experienced by vehicles at the intersection.6 LOS A, B, and C indicate conditions where traffic 
             moves without significant delays over periods of peak hour travel demand. LOS D and E are 
             progressively worse operating conditions. LOS F represents conditions where average vehicle 
             delay has become excessive and demand has exceeded capacity.  
             Volumetocapacity (V/C) ratio: A decimal representation (typically between 0.00 and 1.00) of 
             the proportion of capacity that is being used at a turn movement, approach leg, or intersection. 
             It is determined by dividing the peak hour traffic volume by the hourly capacity of a given 
             intersection or movement. A lower ratio indicates smooth operations and minimal delays. As the 
             ratio approaches 1.00, congestion increases and performance is reduced. If the ratio is greater 
             than 1.00, the turn movement, approach leg, or intersection is oversaturated and usually results 
             in excessive queues and long delays. 

Required Operating Standards
Marion County's minimum performance standard is LOS "E" with a volume to capacity (v/c) ratio of 0.9 
or less for twoway stopcontrolled intersections. At intersections with private driveways, LOS "F" may 
be acceptable based on the discretion of Marion County Staff.7 The City of Stayton also identifies a 
minimum performance standard of LOS "E" or LOS "F" with a v/c ratio of 0.95 or less. Because Shaff 
Road is under Marion County jurisdiction, their standards are used for this analysis.  

Existing Operating Conditions
Existing traffic operations at the study intersections were determined for the a.m. and midday peak 
hours based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology8 and compared with Marion County's 
minimum acceptable level of service (LOS) operating standard. The estimated delay, LOS, and V/C ratio 
of each study intersection are shown in Table 5. As shown, all existing study intersections currently meet 
operating standards. It should be noted that during the a.m. peak dropoff, there was considerable delay 
observed for which is consistent with the Level of Service "E" operations shown.

School Transportation Observations
The school site was observed during the a.m. peak period (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) when parents drop off 
students and during the midday peak (2:00 to 4:00 p.m.) when students are picked up from school. 
During the a.m. peak, many parents park on the shoulder along Shaff Road to let students out (mostly on 
the north side with a few on the south side). Many vehicles traveling north on Gardner Avenue let 
students out when they come to a stop at Shaff Road. A total of 70 vehicles were observed dropping 
students off along Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue. 
During the midday peak, parents again utilized the shoulder along Shaff Road to park and wait for the 
2:55 p.m. school release. Parents began arriving approximately 20 minutes prior to the school release, at 
which point most of the shoulder space near the school was occupied. In total, 35 vehicles were 
observed stopping along Shaff Road to pick up students. 
Congestion was observed for approximately 15 minutes prior to the 7:55 a.m. peak period due to the 
sudden pulse in school related traffic. Traffic along Shaff Road queued up and moved very slowly as 
drivers waited for pedestrians at the school crossing adjacent to Garner Avenue and vehicles pulling 
onto and off of the shoulder. Northbound queues on Gardner Avenue extended up to 10 vehicles during 
peak congestion periods; however, this queue quickly dissipated. Internally, the school site could not 
effectively accommodate the number of vehicles entering and exiting the site. Figure 3 shows congestion 
related to vehicles queued up waiting to turn into the school parking lot during the a.m. drop off period. 
The 20 mph school speed zone that is regulated with school speed zone flashers on Shaff Road 
significantly reduces the travels speeds adjacent to the school. There is also a marked school crossing at 
Gardner Avenue that is controlled by two school crossing guards, as shown in Figure 4. Between the 20 
mph school speed zone and the marked school crossing, the movements of pedestrians across Shaff 
Road were conducted in a safe and efficient manner.  
The traffic counts yielded 127 pedestrians using the school crosswalk across Shaff Road at Gardner 
Avenue in the morning peak and 196 pedestrians used the crosswalk in the midday peak hour. The 
school crossing guards stopped traffic 27 times to cross the 127 pedestrians in the a.m. peak hours and 
21 times to cross the 197 pedestrians in the p.m. peak hour. The pedestrian crossings were included in 
the intersection analysis to include the delay incurred by the school crosswalk.

Collision Analysis
Three years of collision records (20102012) for the study area were obtained from the Oregon 
Department of Transportation (ODOT) collision database. As shown in Table 6, there were four collisions 
at the Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue intersection. 
Two of the collisions at the Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue intersection were rearend collisions that both 
resulted in injuries. The remaining two collisions were fixed object crashes, one resulting in an injury and 
one property damage only. There were no pedestrian collisions for the study area and no fatalities. As 
shown, the collision rate for these intersections is less than 1.0 collisions per million entering vehicles, a 
common threshold used to identify an intersection that may require additional safety analysis.

CHAPTER 3: PROJECT IMPACTS
This chapter reviews the impacts that the proposed site improvements would have on the study area 
transportation system. This includes analysis of future operating conditions based on the proposed site 
improvements and existing number of trips generated by the school. The study intersections selected for 
analysis of future conditions include: 

             Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue/School Access 
             Shaff Road/East Project Access 
             Shaff Road/West Project Access (Bus Exit Only) 


Access, Circulation, and Parking Improvements
The proposed site modifications will include additional parking and improved access and internal 
circulation. The eastern access (currently a bus entrance only) would serve ingress movements for buses, 
teachers, and parents. Parents can then loop through the drop off area while buses and teachers will 
continue straight. The teachers will access a new a teacher parking lot, while buses will drive past the 
parking lot to a loading zone on the north side of the school. The buses will then exit the school through 
a bus exit only driveway at the west end of the school property. A new access will be created across 
from Gardner Avenue that will provide access to a visitor/parent parking lot and will be used for all 
teachers and parents to exit the school. A site plan is included in the appendix for additional details.  

Trip Generation
The proposed improvements to the Stayton Middle School are not expected to increase the number of 
students or the number of trips generated by the site. However, it is desired that the site improvements 
will remove the majority of the vehicles that currently use Shaff Road and Gardner Avenue to drop 
off/pick up students. Therefore, for the purposes of this transportation analysis, it was assumed that all 
vehicles currently stopping on Shaff Road and Gardner Avenue to pick up/drop off students would enter 
the project site. A total of 140 trips (one drop off/pick up vehicle equals 2 trips) into and out of the 
school site were added during the a.m. peak and 70 trips into and out of the school site were added 
during the midday peak. The total number of trips assumed to be generated by the project site are 
shown in Table 7.  
Also shown in Table 7 is the trip generation rate calculated for Stayton Middles School as well as the 
average rate for a typical middle school provided by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE).9 As 
shown, the trip rate specific to Stayton Middle School is 4060% higher than the typical middle school

Trip Distribution
Because the school access configuration is changing (now parents and teachers can enter the site via the 
easternmost access point), assumptions were made to estimate the number of vehicles entering the site 
at each access point. It was assumed that all buses would access the school using the eastern driveway 
and would exit using the bus exit only access at the west end of the property (rightout only). It was also 
assumed that roughly 60% of vehicles (parents and teachers) would enter the site through the eastern 
driveway, while the remaining 40% would enter through the middle access opposite Gardner Avenue. All 
vehicles, except for buses, would exit the school at the middle access. Existing turn movement counts 
were used to estimate the number of vehicles coming from the east, west, and south. Figure 5 shows the 
trip distribution percentages and the number of vehicles assumed to enter and exit school property at 
each driveway location.

Future Traffic Volumes and Operating Conditions
Future operating conditions were analyzed at the study intersections based on the proposed school 
access modifications which are expected to be completed in 2014. A 2% annual growth rate was applied 
to nonschool traffic to account for background traffic growth (the Stayton TSP assumed a 1.4% per year 
growth for the Shaff Road vicinity10). The weekday a.m. and midday peak hour traffic volumes used to 
analyze the future existing zoning scenario are shown in Figure 6.

Future traffic operations at the study intersections were determined for the a.m. and midday peak hours 
based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology.11 The study intersection operating 
conditions for the year 2014 scenario are listed in Table 8. As shown, the Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue
School Access intersection would not meet operating standards based on the proposed lane 
configuration.

Turn Lane Warrant Analysis
Turn lane warrants were evaluated at the study intersections to determine if leftturn lanes from Shaff 
Road into the school or onto Gardner Avenue are warranted. Two sets of criteria were used, including 
those identified by the Highway Research Board (HRB) and the Oregon Department of Transportation 
(ODOT). Table 9 shows that warrants are not met for any of the leftturn movements from Shaff Road 
based on HRB criteria thresholds, and that the warrants were met based on ODOT criteria.

speed facilities (greater than 40 mph), they are based on lower volume thresholds and are not 
appropriate to be applied to the Shaff Road school driveways. In addition, field observations determined 
that slow travel speeds and gaps created by the crossing guards at school crosswalk created the 
necessary gaps in traffic to safely facilitate left turn movements during the peak school periods from 
Shaff Road without a left turn lane. 


Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices Handbook (MUTCD) traffic signal warrants were evaluated at 
Shaff Road/Gardner AvenueSchool Access for the school a.m. and midday peak periods. The MUTCD 
Warrant #3, Peak Hour warrant was evaluated and was not met due to low volumes on both the major 
or minor street. In addition, preliminary 8hour warrants were performed based on daily traffic volumes 
following ODOT methodology. These warrants were also not met. Therefore, a traffic signal is not an 
option for improving the LOS "F" conditions during the a.m. peak hour. 

Site Plan Review
The proposed site plan was reviewed to identify transportation related deficiencies related to vehicle, 
bicycle, and pedestrian modes of travel. This review included connectivity and accessibility for non
automotive modes, sight distance at access points, internal circulation, and an assessment of available 
onsite parking.  

Pedestrian and Bicycle Connectivity
Internal sidewalks are provided to connect parking and drop off areas to school buildings, and several 
marked crosswalks improve safety for student crossing internal travel ways.  

Access Spacing
The Marion County Rural TSP identifies a minimum access spacing requirement of 300 feet for a minor 
arterial inside of city's urban growth boundary. It also indicates that access management guidelines 
identified by a particular city should take precedence over Marion County standards. In this case, the 
City of Stayton Development Code12 also identifies a minimum spacing requirement of 300 feet for Shaff 
Road (a minor arterial). The distance between the eastern access and Gardner Avenue is approximately 
375 feet, which satisfies this requirement. The distance between Gardner Avenue and the bus exit to the 
west is approximately 165 feet, which does not meet minimum spacing requirements. However, this is a 
restricted access and will only be used by school buses making right turns onto Shaff Road. A variance to 
the County/City access spacing standards will be required for the bus access.  

Sight Distance
A preliminary sight distance review was conducted at the existing access points. There do not appear to 
be buildings, large trees, or other objects along the north side of Shaff Road that would restrict sight 
distance for vehicles leaving school property and turning onto Shaff Road. All proposed driveways will be 
required to meet American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 
intersection sight distance requirements13 as measured from 14.5 feet back from the edge of pavement.

Internal Circulation
The proposed site plan provides an improved area for parents to drop off and pick up students, which 
should reduce the number of vehicles stopping along Shaff Road and Gardner Avenue. Buses are routed 
away from other traffic along the east side of the school to a new drop off area located north of the 
school. Internal intersections should be monitored to ensure they operate effectively and that queuing 
does not extend onto Shaff Road. If queuing does impact Shaff Road, a transportation supervisor should 
be implemented that monitors traffic flow onsite to assure parents exiting the site do not block entering 
vehicles. Figure 7 illustrates the congestion currently experienced in the school parking lot during the 
a.m. peak period.

Parking
City of Stayton development code requires 2 parking stalls per classroom for an elementary or middle 
school as well as offstreet student drop off and pick up facilities. Stayton Middle School has 29 
classrooms resulting in a minimum of 58 required parking stalls. The current parking lot has 
approximately 73 parking stalls, which meets the minimum requirements; however, it is our 
understanding that the existing 73 parking stalls are insufficient for parking demand for school events. 
Therefore, the School District has proposed a total of 138 parking stalls (including 5 handicap accessible 
parking stalls). This proposed parking supply would meet the City's minimum requirements and historical 
event parking demand. These will allow school parking demand to be accommodated onsite rather than 
impacting Shaff Road and adjacent residential areas. Table 10 summarizes required and proposed 
parking requirements.

CHAPTER 4: PROJECT MITIGATION
Future 2014 intersection analysis identified failing intersection operations at the proposed school access 
across from Gardner Avenue. The failing movement at this intersection is the southbound left turn 
movement from Stayton Middle School during the a.m. peak hour, which would operate at LOS "F" and 
have a v/c ratio of 0.93.  
In addition to the failing operations, the proposed lane configuration would not properly align with the 
existing lanes on the northbound Gardner Avenue approach. The south leg of this intersection (Gardner 
Avenue) has single northbound and southbound lanes with bike lanes on both sides. By including a 
southbound leftturn lane, it would not be possible to align both the northbound and southbound 
through lanes without modification to the south leg of the intersection. 
The following options should be considered to improve alignment and operations at the Shaff 
Road/Gardner AvenueSchool Access.  

Mitigation Alternatives
The following options should be considered to improve alignment and operations at Shaff Road/Gardner 
Avenue/School Access intersection.  

Restriping Northbound Gardner Approach
Installing a left turn lane out of the project access opposite Gardner Avenue is critical to minimize delay 
of vehicles exiting the school in the morning peak period. As previously mentioned, this left turn lane 
would not align with the northbound approach from Gardner Avenue. Restriping the northbound 
approach to include leftturn lane would allow the northbound and southbound through movements to 
align as necessary. This would also reduce delay and queuing for northbound traffic on Gardner Avenue. 
Gardner Avenue has a 40foot crosssection that includes two 14foot travel lanes and two 6foot bike 
lanes. A northbound leftturn lane could be installed by ending the northbound bike lane in advance of 
the intersection and restriping the south leg. This would require cyclists to share a travel lane with 
vehicles or walk their bikes along the sidewalk and use the marked crossing along Shaff Road.  
If removal of the bike lane is not desired by the City and County, the south leg could be restriped to 
include two 5foot bike lanes, two 11foot travel lanes and an 8foot striped transition area in the 
middle. This striping option would meet the transitional requirements of the MUTCD.  

Peak Hour Spreading
Existing traffic counts identified a peak hour factor (PHF) of 0.62 at the Shaff Road/Gardner Avenue 
intersection during the a.m. peak hour, which is consistent with the typical peak for an intersection 
adjacent to a school. The PHF is used to quantify the increase in traffic volumes during the highest 15
minute interval within the peak hour. A low PHF such as this is indicative of a high 15minute peak in 
traffic volumes. Because intersection operations are based on the worst 15minute interval, changes in 
the PHF can significantly impact intersection operations at the project driveways.  
If the PHF at this intersection was increased to 0.65, the intersection would meet operating standards 
without further mitigation (LOS "E"). While some spreading will naturally occur as parents change driving 
habits to limit incurred delay, it is unclear whether a PHF of 0.65 or greater will be achieved. There are

several management options the North Santiam School District could consider to encourage peak hour 
spreading that include developing a plan to vary the class times based on grade.  

Shaff Road On-Street Loading Zone
Another option to reducing congestion at this intersection would be to provide an additional student 
drop off and pick up area along Shaff Road (similar to what exists today). This would reduce the number 
of vehicles entering and exiting the school site during peak conditions, thereby reducing congestion at 
school access. The City of Stayton has future plans for bike lanes on Shaff Road that would conflict with 
the onstreet loading zone once Shaff Road is improved as planned. 
Further discussion between Marion County, the City of Stayton, and the school district will be needed to 
determine if the unmitigated operations are acceptable or what the preferred solution should include.

TRAFFIC LEVELS OF SERVICE
Analysis of traffic volumes is useful in understanding the general nature of traffic in an area, but by itself
indicates neither the ability of the street network to carry additional traffic nor the quality of service
afforded by the street facilities. For this, the concept of level of service has been developed to subjectively
describe traffic performance. Level of service can be measured at intersections and along key roadway
segments.

Level of service categories are similar to report card ratings for traffic performance. Intersections are
typically the controlling bottlenecks of traffic flow and the ability of a roadway system to carry traffic
efficiently is generally diminished in their vicinities. Levels of Service A, B and C indicate conditions
where traffic moves without significant delays over periods of peak travel demand. Level of service D and
E are progressively worse peak hour operating conditions and F conditions represent where demand
exceeds the capacity of an intersection. Most urban communities set level of service D as the minimum
acceptable level of service for peak hour operation and plan for level of service C or better for all other
times of the day. The Highway Capacity Manual provides level of service calculation methodology for
both intersections and arterials. 1 The following two sections provide interpretations of the analysis
approaches.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS (Two-Way Stop Controlled)

Unsignalized intersection level of service is reported for the major street and minor street (generally, left
turn movements). The method assesses available and critical gaps in the traffic stream which make it
possible for side street traffic to enter the main street flow. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual describes
the detailed methodology. It is not unusual for an intersection to experience level of service E or F
conditions for the minor street left turn movement. It should be understood that, often, a poor level of
service is experienced by only a few vehicles and the intersection as a whole operates acceptably.

Unsignalized intersection levels of service are described in the following table.

Level of Service Expected Delay     (Sec/Veh)


       A         Little or no delay   0-10.0

          B                  Short traffic delay                                             >10.1-15.0

          C                  Average traffic delays                                          >15.1-25.0

          D                  Long traffic delays                                             >25.1-35.0

          E                  Very long traffic delays                                        >35.1-50.0

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

For signalized intersections, level of service is evaluated based upon average vehicle delay experienced by
vehicles entering an intersection. Control delay (or signal delay) includes initial deceleration delay, queue
move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. In previous versions of this chapter of the HCM
(1994 and earlier), delay included only stopped delay. As delay increases, the level of service decreases.
Calculations for signalized and unsignalized intersections are different due to the variation in traffic
control. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual provides the basis for these calculations.


    Level of Delay
    Service  (secs.)               Description
    
      A      <10.00  Free Flow/Insignificant Delays: No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic and no vehicle waits
                     longer than one red indication. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Progression is extremely favorable and
                     most vehicles arrive during the green phase.

        B          10.1-20.0        Stable Operation/Minimal Delays: An occasional approach phase is fully utilized. Many drivers begin
                                    to feel somewhat restricted within platoons of vehicles. This level generally occurs with good progression,
                                    short cycle lengths, or both.

        C          20.1-35.0        Stable Operation/Acceptable Delays: Major approach phases fully utilized. Most drivers feel somewhat
                                    restricted. Higher delays may result from fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle
                                    failures may begin to appear at this level, and the number of vehicles stopping is significant.

        D          35.1-55.0        Approaching Unstable/Tolerable Delays: The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable.
                                    Drivers may have to wait through more than one red signal indication. Longer delays may result from
                                    some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high v/c ratios. The proportion of
                                    vehicles not stopping declines, and individual cycle failures are noticeable.

        E          55.1-80.0        Unstable Operation/Significant Delays: Volumes at or near capacity. Vehicles may wait though several
                                    signal cycles. Long queues form upstream from intersection. These high delay values generally indicate
                                    poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are a frequent
                                    occurrence.

        F          >80.0            Forced Flow/Excessive Delays: Represents jammed conditions. Queues may block upstream
                                    intersections. This level occurs when arrival flow rates exceed intersection capacity, and is considered to
                                    be unacceptable to most drivers. Poor progression, long cycle lengths, and v/c ratios approaching 1.0 may
                                    contribute to these high delay levels.

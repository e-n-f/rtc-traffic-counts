1.       INTRODUCTION
Broward County retained the services of Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) to conduct a traffic study for
the existing Broward County Convention Center. The purpose of the traffic study is to determine the
existing Broward County Convention Center traffic in relation to the total traffic volumes on the study area
network and determine the operating conditions for the SE 17th Street corridor between Eisenhower
Boulevard and Federal Highway.

The study area is generally bounded to the north by SE 17th Street, to the south by Eller Drive, to the west by
Federal Highway and to the east by the port and along SE 17th Street/SR A1A (Seabreeze Boulevard) to
include the intersection of SE 17th Street/SR A1A (Seabreeze Boulevard) at SE 23rd Avenue and the roadway
segment from SE 23rd Avenue to Harbor Drive. The study area is shown in Figure 1.

Per the scope of services, traffic volume data were collected at fourteen intersections and along sixteen
roadway segments within the study area. Figure 2 shows the locations of all turning movement counts
(TMC) and roadway segments. The TMC at the intersections will be either 24-hour or 6-hour peak counts
dependent on the location identified in the scope of services. The list of intersections with the length of data
collection is:

     •   Eisenhower Boulevard at SE 18th Court (24-hour)
     •   Eisenhower Boulevard at Convention Center exit-only driveway (24-hour)
     •   Eisenhower Boulevard at Convention Center driveway (just north of SE 20th Street) (24-hour)
     •   Eisenhower Boulevard at SE 20th Street (24-hour)
     •   17th Street Ramp at Convention Center west driveway (24-hour)
     •   SE 17th Street at Federal Highway (6-hour)
     •   SE 17th Street at S. Miami Road (6-hour)
     •   SE 17th Street at SE 10th Avenue (6-hour)
     •   SE 17th Street at Eisenhower Boulevard (6-hour)
     •   SE 17th Street at SE 23rd Avenue (6-hour)
     •   Eisenhower Boulevard at Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street) (6-hour)
     •   Eisenhower Boulevard/SE 19th Avenue at Eller Drive (6-hour)
     •   Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street) at Federal Highway (6-hour)
     •   Eller Drive at McIntosh Road (6-hour)

     NOTE: The scope of services had two Convention Center driveways listed along the 17th Street Ramp;
     however only the western driveway was open during the data collection phase. Also, the scope of
     services listed Eisenhower Boulevard and SE 20th Street for both a 6-hour TMC and a 24-hour TMC.

The traffic data collection for the sixteen roadway segments includes 24-hour, 7-day bidirectional traffic
volumes (average daily traffic (ADT)) and vehicle classification. The list of roadway segments is:

     •   SE 17th Street: Federal Highway to S. Miami Road
     •   SE 17th Street: S. Miami Road to SE 10th Avenue
     •   SE 17th Street: SE 10th Avenue to Cordova Road
     •   SE 17th Street: Cordova Road to Eisenhower Boulevard
     •   SE 17th Street: Eisenhower Boulevard to SE 23rd Avenue
     •   SR A1A (Seabreeze Boulevard): SE 23rd Avenue to Harbor Drive
     •   Federal Highway: North of SE 17th Street
     •   Federal Highway: SE 17th Street to SR-84

At the completion of the traffic data collection, all traffic data were adjusted to be representative of the
average peak-season conditions by using the Peak Season Factor and the Weekly Axle Factor.

The adjusted data were used for the evaluation of the operating conditions of the network within the study
area, as defined in the scope of services.

2.      EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
As part of the data collection task, existing network conditions were collected for each roadway segment and
intersection identified in the scope of services. The geometrics and characteristics of each are detailed in the
following sections.


2.1.    Roadway Segments

SE 17th Street/SR A1A is a State Minor Arterial in an east-west orientation within the study area and then
turning to a north-south orientation to the east of the study area. It provides access for the residential area,
west of Federal Highway, to the coastline north of the convention center area. Within the project study area,
the facility has three travel lanes in each direction with dedicated left-turn lanes at the intersections. To the
west of Federal Highway and east of Eisenhower Boulevard, SE 17th Street/SR A1A has two travel lanes in
each direction with dedicated turn lanes at the intersections. The posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour
(mph).

Federal Highway is a State Principal Arterial in a north-south orientation. It is designated as US Highway 1.
It provides a connection from Miami up the coast parallel to Interstate 95. Within the project study area, the
facility has three travel lanes in each direction with dedicated left-turn lanes at the intersections. The posted
speed limit is 40 mph.

Eisenhower Boulevard, Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street) and Eller Drive are classified as City Collectors
according to the Broward Highway Functional Classification Map. Each facility generally has two travel
lanes in each direction with turn lanes at several intersections. These facilities provide direct access for the
convention center and the port. There are security checkpoints located on each of these facilities. On
Eisenhower Boulevard, the checkpoint is located approximately 1,000 feet south of SE 17th Street. On
Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street), the checkpoint is located approximately 650 feet east of Federal
Highway. On Eller Drive, the checkpoint is located approximately 4,000 feet east of the Federal Highway
overpass and between McIntosh Road and SE 18th Avenue.


2.2.    Intersections

Eisenhower Boulevard at SE 18th Court is a two-way stop-controlled T-intersection. The east leg of the
intersection provides access to the northern side of the convention center. It consists of one approach lane
(westbound) that is a right-turn only lane and one departure lane (eastbound). The northbound approach
consists of three approach lanes. Two are designated as left-turn lanes for the intersection of SE 17th Street
at Eisenhower Boulevard and one is a shared through/right-turn lane. The northbound and southbound
approaches on Eisenhower Boulevard are divided by a raised median, therefore a through movement is the
only southbound movement allowed.

Eisenhower Boulevard at Convention Center exit-only driveway is a two-way stop-controlled T-intersection.
The westbound approach consists of one right-turn only lane exiting the convention center parking lot. The
northbound approach consists of one through lane and one shared through/right-turn lane. The northbound
and southbound approaches on Eisenhower Boulevard are divided by a raised median, therefore a through
movement is the only southbound movement allowed.

Eisenhower Boulevard at Convention Center driveway (just north of SE 20th Street) is a two-way stop-
controlled four-leg intersection. The east leg of the intersection provides access to the western side of the


                                                                                                            5

convention center. It consists of one exit lane (westbound) that is a shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane
and one inbound travel lane (eastbound). The west leg is a gated driveway. The northbound approach
consists of one through lane and one shared through/right-turn lane. The southbound approach consists of
one left-turn lane, one through lane and one shared through/right-turn lane.

Eisenhower Boulevard at SE 20th Street is a signalized four-leg intersection with a large median area on the
east leg separating the inbound and outbound traffic lanes. The east leg of the intersection provides access to
the southern side of the convention center and parking structure along the eastern side of the convention
center. There is a gate located just to the east of the intersection to gain access into the parking structure.
The westbound approach consists of three departure lanes. One is a channelized right-turn lane and the other
two are left-turn only lanes. The northbound approach consists of one channelized right-turn lane, two
through lanes (the leftmost lane is striped for a lane reduction/merge) and one left-turn lane. The southbound
approach consists of one left-turn lane, one through lane and one shared through/right-turn lane. The
eastbound approach consists of one shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane.

17th Street Ramp at Convention Center west driveway is a two-way stop-controlled T- intersection providing
ingress/egress to the eastern side of the convention center. The south leg of the intersection (convention
center parking area) consists of one right-turn only departure lane and one inbound travel lane. The west leg
is a one-way eastbound ramp from SE 17th Street that consists of one shared through/right-turn lane. The
east leg of consists of one left-turn only lane for access into the convention center.

SE 17th Street at Federal Highway is a signalized four-leg intersection. The eastbound approach consists of
an exclusive right-turn lane, one through lane, one shared through/left-turn lane and one exclusive left-turn
lane. The westbound approach consists of an exclusive right-turn lane, one through lane, one shared
through/left-turn lane and two exclusive left-turn lanes. The northbound approach consists of one exclusive
right-turn lane, three through lanes and one exclusive left-turn lane. The southbound approach consists of
one shared through/right-turn lane, two through lanes and two exclusive left-turn lanes.

SE 17th Street at S. Miami Road is a signalized four-leg intersection; however northbound, southbound and
eastbound left-turn movements are restricted by a raised median on SE 17th Street and the westbound through
movements are not controlled by the traffic signal. The eastbound approach consists of two through lanes
and one shared through/right-turn lane. The westbound approach consists of two through lanes, one shared

3.         TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTION
To provide data for the determination of the existing traffic volumes associated with the Broward County
Convention Center and evaluation of the traffic conditions within the study area, TMCs and bidirectional
counts were conducted throughout the study area. The data collection time period was selected in
coordination with the Broward County Convention Center and Broward County staff. The traffic data
collection was completed from Tuesday, October 8, 2013 through Monday, October 14, 2013. This time
period was selected due to a major event(s) occurring at the convention center. Table 1 shows the events
scheduled for this time period:

3.1.       Intersection Turning Movement Counts

The intersection TMCs were conducted by the project team on Friday, October 11, 2013. In order to capture
the entering and exiting volumes from the convention center access points, 24-hour TMCs were conducted at
five designated intersections adjacent to the convention center. These intersections are:

       •   Eisenhower Boulevard at SE 18th Court
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard at Convention Center exit-only driveway
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard at Convention Center driveway (just north of SE 20th Street)
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard at SE 20th Street
       •   17th Street Ramp at Convention Center west driveway

To supplement this data, nine 6-hour TMCs were conducted at intersections throughout the study area.
These counts were conducted on Friday, October 11, 2013, from 7:00 - 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM and
4:00 – 6:00 PM, at the following intersections:

       •   SE 17th Street at Federal Highway
       •   SE 17th Street at S. Miami Road
       •   SE 17th Street at SE 10th Avenue
       •   SE 17th Street at Eisenhower Boulevard


                                                                                                         8

       •   SE 17th Street at SE 23rd Avenue
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard at Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street)
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard/SE 19th Avenue at Eller Drive
       •   Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street) at Federal Highway
       •   Eller Drive at McIntosh Road

       NOTES:
         1. The scope of services had two Convention Center driveways listed along the 17th Street Ramp;
            however only the western driveway was open during the data collection phase.
         2. The scope of services listed Eisenhower Boulevard and SE 20th Street for both a 6-hour TMC
            and a 24-hour TMC. A 24-hour TMC was completed for this intersection.
         3. The roadway sections leading to the intersection of Eller Drive and McIntosh Road were under
            construction during the data collection.

From the TMC data, the system-wide hourly peak periods were determined. The peak hours for the AM,
midday and PM periods are 8:00 – 9:00 AM, 12:00 – 1:00 PM and 4:30 – 5:30 PM, respectively. Figure 2
shows the locations of the TMCs. The raw TMC data are included in Appendix A.


3.2.       Roadway Segment Traffic Counts

In addition to the TMCs, 7-day 24-hour bidirectional counts and vehicle classification were collected on
roadway segments throughout the study area. The counts were conducted from Tuesday, October 8 through
Monday, October 14. The 16 count locations are listed below and shown on Figure 2.

       •   SE 17th Street: Federal Highway to S. Miami Road
       •   SE 17th Street: S. Miami Road to SE 10th Avenue
       •   SE 17th Street: SE 10th Avenue to Cordova Road
       •   SE 17th Street: Cordova Road to Eisenhower Boulevard
       •   SE 17th Street: Eisenhower Boulevard to SE 23rd Avenue
       •   SR A1A (Seabreeze Boulevard): SE 23rd Avenue to Harbor Drive
       •   Federal Highway: North of SE 17th Street
       •   Federal Highway: SE 17th Street to SR-84
       •   Federal Highway: first link south of SR-84
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard: SE 17th Street to SE 18th Street (north of Convention Center access)
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard: SE 18th Street to SE 20th Street (main Convention Center access)
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard: SE 20th Street to Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street)
       •   Eisenhower Boulevard: Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street) to Eller Drive
       •   Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street): Federal Highway to S. Miami Road
       •   Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street): S. Miami Road to Eisenhower Boulevard
       •   Eller Drive: Eisenhower Boulevard to McIntosh Road

There were three count locations that experienced a malfunction in the collection of the vehicle
classifications. These locations are:

           •   SE 17th Street: S. Miami Road to SE 10th Street
           •   Federal Highway: 1st link south of SR-84
           •   Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street): Federal Highway to S. Miami




                                                                                                          9
                                                                                                     FINAL

Also, there were some sporadic malfunctions during the collection of the traffic volume counts. The missing
data were estimated based on the traffic volume counts during the same periods of time for the other count
days.

A summary of the raw tube counts and vehicle classification for each of the locations is included in
Appendix B.


3.3.    Traffic Count Adjustments

In order to account for daily and seasonal variations in the intersection traffic volumes and tube counts, the
raw intersection traffic data collected were adjusted by the Peak Season Factor to be representative of
average peak-season conditions. This information is provided by FDOT. There are two factors that are
included in this report, seasonal factors and the peak season categorical factors. The seasonal factor is an
adjustment for the average daily traffic (ADT) which is applied to the 7 day tube counts and the peak season
categorical adjustment is a factor for the peak hour which is then applied to the TMC’s.

The peak season categorical factor for these TMC locations was 1.22. Also, the 7-day 24-hour bidirectional
count data were adjusted to be representative of the average peak-season conditions and for an axle
adjustment. The season factor applied to the tube counts was 1.10 and the weekly axle factor was 0.99.

Detailed spreadsheets for the adjusted traffic volumes for the TMCs are included in Appendix C and Figure
3 shows the adjusted peak hour volumes at each of the intersections. Detailed spreadsheets for the roadway
segments are included in Appendix D and Figure 4 shows the adjusted average daily traffic volumes along
each of the roadway segments.

4.       CONVENTION CENTER TRAFFIC
The traffic data collected, as described in Section 3, were utilized to determine the entering and exiting
volumes from the convention center access points and determine the distribution patterns of the convention
center traffic throughout the study area roadway network.

The 24-hour TMCs conducted at the convention center access locations showed a daily total entering and
exiting traffic volume of 2,335 and 2,128 vehicles, respectively. Also, for the peak periods of AM, midday,
and PM, the entering volumes were 181, 202 and 217 vehicles and the exiting volumes were 81, 174 and
222, respectively.

The convention center traffic volumes were distributed onto the roadway network based on the turning
percentages of traffic at each of the intersections within the study boundary. Figure 5 shows the peak hour
convention center traffic within the study area network and Figure 6 shows the daily convention center
traffic on the sixteen roadway segments identified in the scope of services.

Based on the current traffic conditions and the turning movement percentages throughout the network, the
approximate trip distribution percentages for this report are as follows:

     •   15% along SR-A1A;
     •   46% along SE 17th Street to the west of the convention center;
     •   13% along Spangler Boulevard (SE 24th Street);
     •   20% along Eisenhower to the south of Spangler Boulevard;
     •   6% along SE 16th Street north of SE 17th Street

5.      SE 17th STREET CORRIDOR
SE 17th Street provides a main connection to the Broward County Convention Center. The efficient
operation of the corridor is important to both the convention center and the port. As part of this study, the
operations of the corridor were analyzed to determine the level-of-service (LOS) at the intersections on SE
17th Street from Federal Highway to Eisenhower Boulevard and along the arterial between the same
intersections. A Synchro operational analysis was conducted for both the total traffic conditions and the
traffic conditions with the Broward County Convention Center traffic removed from the network volumes.
The traffic volumes for both scenarios are shown in Figure 7 – Background Traffic (without Convention
Center Traffic Volumes) and Figure 8 – Total Traffic.

The capacity analyses results in the determination of a LOS for each intersection and arterial segment. The
LOS is a concept used to describe how well a facility operates with LOS A being the best and LOS F the
worst. Table 2 presents the thresholds for a signalized intersection.

5.1.    Background Traffic Volumes (Volumes without Convention Center Traffic)

As discussed previously, the purpose of the study was to collect traffic volume data throughout the study
area as a means of determining the traffic volumes associated with the convention center and removing those
volumes from the data to create the background traffic conditions.

To determine the background traffic volumes, the convention center traffic volumes (shown in Figures 5 and
6) were removed from the adjusted traffic data (shown in Figures 3 and 4). The background traffic volumes
for the peak hours (AM, midday, and PM) are shown in Figure 9. The background ADT volumes are shown
in Figure 10.

Tables 3 - 5 summarize the peak hour traffic volumes and percentages of traffic along SE 17th Street for the
convention center traffic and total traffic. Also, included in the tables are a summary of the LOS for the
intersections along SE 17th Street. Table 6 summarizes the ADT volumes along several roadway segments
within the study area and Table 7 summarizes the peak hour LOS along the same roadway segments.

As shown in Tables 3-5, all of the intersections operate at an acceptable level-of-service with the exception
of SE 17th Street and Federal Highway. This intersection operates at LOS F during all time periods and the
two different traffic scenarios. As shown by the analysis, the Broward County Convention Center traffic has
a minor impact on the overall traffic operations of the SE 17th Street corridor. The Synchro analyses are
included in Appendix E.

The purpose of the traffic study is to determine the existing Broward County Convention Center traffic in
relation to the total traffic volumes on the study area network and determine the operating conditions for the
SE 17th Street corridor between Eisenhower Boulevard and Federal Highway.

Traffic volume data were collected at fourteen intersections and along sixteen roadway segments within the
study area and the raw traffic data were adjusted to be representative of the average peak-season conditions.
Based on the traffic data collected at the convention center ingress/egress points, the total traffic volumes
associated with the convention center were determined. Based on the current turning movement percentages
at the study area intersections, the directional distribution of the convention center traffic was determined.
The convention center traffic volumes were then removed from the total traffic volumes within the study
area network to develop the “background” traffic conditions.

The SE 17th Street corridor was analyzed under “background” conditions (traffic volumes without the
convention center traffic) and under total traffic conditions. As noted in Section 5, the convention center
traffic has a minor impact on the overall traffic operations of the SE 17th Street corridor. This includes minor
increases in overall intersection delay and no change in LOS at any of the analyzed intersections.

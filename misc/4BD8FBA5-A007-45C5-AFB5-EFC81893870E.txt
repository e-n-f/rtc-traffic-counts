                                SITE ACCESS TRAFFIC ANALYSIS



SECTION 1.0 INTRODUCTION
This report documents a site access traffic analysis undertaken to analyze the proposed development of a

RaceTrac market with fuel service, proposed to be located at the northeast corner of the intersection of U.S.

Highway 41 at Pearl Avenue, in Manatee County, Florida; as shown on the project location map (Figure 1.0).



SECTION 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project site is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of U.S. Highway 41 at Pearl Avenue, in

Manatee County, Florida. The project site is currently developed with an approximately 20,000 square foot

building which formerly operated as a furniture store, which is currently vacant and non-operational. The

subject site is proposed to be developed as a RaceTrac market (6,000± square feet) with fueling service (16

vehicle fueling positions). Access to the project site is proposed to be provided via connections to U.S.

Highway 41 and Pearl Avenue, as shown in the preliminary site plan (refer to Figure 2.0), noting that the

connection to U.S. Highway 41 will be shared with the adjacent property to the north. The project site is

expected to buildout prior to the end of 2014.



SECTION 3.0 PROJECT SITE TRIP GENERATION
The daily and peak hour trip generation of the project site was estimated using trip characteristic data in

accordance with Trip Generation (Institute of Transportation Engineers [ITE], 9th edition, 2012) and Trip

Generation Handbook (ITE, 2nd edition, 2004). Table 1.0 summarizes the resulting trip generation estimate.

SECTION 4.0 PROJECT SITE TRIP DISTRIBUTION & ASSIGNMENT
The distribution and assignment of project traffic was estimated based on existing traffic patterns as
determined from peak hour traffic counts. The estimated distribution and assignment of project traffic is
documented in Appendix A.


SECTION 5.0 STUDY AREA
The study area for the site access analysis was determined to consist of the project site access connections to
the adjacent roadway network, and the adjacent intersection of U.S. Highway 41 at Pearl Avenue.


SECTION 6.0 TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Existing traffic volumes were obtained from manual intersection turning movement counts performed in
October 2013. The counts were adjusted to reflect peak season conditions using FDOT 2012 seasonal
adjustment factors. It is noted that during the periods of traffic data collection, oversaturation of the study
intersections was not observed, thus adjustments to reflect demand volumes were not necessary. Traffic
count data for existing conditions is provided in Appendix B. Future year background traffic volumes for the
study area were calculated by applying a 1% annual growth rate to the existing 2013 traffic volumes for the
one year buildout period. The 1% annual growth rate was determined to be reasonable for use in this study
due to the stable traffic volumes exhibited by the adjacent segment of U.S. Highway over the past few years,
as documented in Appendix C; and in consideration that this analysis was not undertaken for the purposes of
evaluating transportation concurrency. Total traffic volumes were calculated by adding project traffic to
background traffic. Figures 3.0 through 5.0 illustrate the traffic volumes used in this analysis.

SECTION 7.0 INTERSECTION OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS
Operational analyses for the study intersections were undertaken for total traffic conditions.                       The
intersection analyses were performed using Synchro analysis software for both AM and PM peak hour
conditions, using existing signal timings where applicable. The results of the intersection analyses are
summarized in Table 2.0 and worksheets documenting the analysis are provided in Appendix D (existing
signal timings are provided in Appendix E).


As shown in Table 2.0, each of the study intersections, including the site access driveway connections, are
anticipated to operate acceptably in consideration of the buildout of the proposed RaceTrac site.

SECTION 8.0 TURN LANE WARRANT & LENGTH EVALUATION
A turn lane warrant evaluation was undertaken to identify if new turn lanes would be needed at the project
site driveway connections to U.S. Highway 41 and Pearl Avenue, as documented in Appendix F. The need for
right turn lanes was evaluated in consideration of warranting criteria documented in the Florida Department
of Transportation's Driveway Handbook (March, 2005). The need for left turn lanes was evaluated in
consideration of warranting criteria documented in the 2011 AASHTO Green Book (Table 9-23). The results
of the turn lane warrant evaluation concluded that new turn lanes are not warranted at either of the project
site driveways. In addition, as documented in Appendix F, the lengths of existing turn lanes adjacent to the
site (that will accommodate project traffic) were found to be adequate.

SECTION 9.0 QUEUE ANALYSIS
A queue analysis was performed for the westbound approach of Pearl Avenue at U.S. Highway 41 to evaluate
existing and potential queuing. Observations of existing queuing were undertaken during AM and PM peak
hour periods in October 2013; as documented in Appendix G and summarized below.


                 AM Peak Hour                                       PM Peak Hour
          Average Queue: 1.9 vehicles                         Average Queue: 4.5 vehicles
          Maximum Queue: 5 vehicles                           Maximum Queue: 8 vehicles

Assuming a length of 25 feet for each vehicle, as is the generally accepted practice, existing queuing would
periodically extend past the subject project site driveway connection to Pearl Avenue, which is proposed to
be located approximately 100 feet east of the stop line at U.S. Highway 41. However, the field observations
indicated that any queuing to this extent (i.e., 100 feet or more) occurs in the shared through/right-turn lane,
and only as a result of the occasional "through" vehicle blocking the major movement (i.e., right-turning
vehicles) from making right-turns on red; whereas for existing conditions the westbound through movement
was identified as 11 vph during the AM peak hour and 7 vph during the PM peak hour, as compared to
westbound-to-northbound right turn volumes of 123 vph during the AM peak hour and 215 vph during the
PM peak hour. Furthermore, due these characteristics, the frequency/duration with which the queue
currently extends past the proposed driveway location is relatively low, and that any additional queuing that
would result from the development of the proposed RaceTrac would be incurred on the RaceTrac site and
not increase the duration or frequency of the queue past the subject driveway. Therefore, it is anticipated
that the subject driveway will operate in a queue-free state for the majority of time during peak traffic hours
which would allow it to be implemented as a full access connection, allowing all traffic movements.


SECTION 10.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Based on the data, analyses and findings contained herein, the following is concluded in consideration of the
development of the subject RaceTrac site:


     Each of the study intersections, including the site access driveway connections, are anticipated to
     operate acceptably in consideration of the buildout of the proposed RaceTrac site.

     New turn lanes were found to not be warranted at either of the project site driveways.

     The lengths of existing turn lanes adjacent to the site (that will accommodate project traffic) were
        found to be adequate.

     It is anticipated that the project site driveway connection to Pearl Avenue will operate in a queue-
     free state for the majority of time during peak traffic hours which would allow it to be implemented
     as a full access connection, allowing all traffic movements.

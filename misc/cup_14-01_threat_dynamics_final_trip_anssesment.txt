Project:      Threat Dynamics Relocation
Subject:      Trip Impact Assessment


This memorandum addresses the anticipated number of trips associated with the relocation of Threat
Dynamics from its current location in Tualatin, Oregon to a light industrial office park located in
Sherwood, Oregon. A trip generation estimate and trip impact assessment is provided herein. Based on
the trip impact assessment and conversations with City of Sherwood staff, the new location can be
occupied while maintaining acceptable levels of operations on the local street system. Additional
details of the trip generation estimate, City of Sherwood Capacity Allocation Program (CAP) Ordinance
2000-1104, and system development charges (SDC) are provided herein.


BACKGROUND
Threat Dynamics, LLC is a firearms facility located in Tualatin, Oregon that offers training classes, an
indoor shooting range, and hosts planned evening training for groups. The facility also has a retail
component that provides retail sales of firearms and related tactical equipment and materials in
support of the training facility. Operating hours are daily between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.

Threat Dynamics is proposing to relocate from their current address at 8250 SW Tonka Road in
Tualatin, Oregon to an existing office building space located at 13565 SW Tualatin Road in Sherwood,
Oregon. The new location occupies approximately 5.72 acres, serves a number of various light
industrial uses, and is located on the north leg of the Tualatin Sherwood Road/Oregon Street
intersection. Because of the light industrial zoning, the Threat Dynamics retail component requires a
conditional land use permit, triggering the need for this trip impact assessment.

The existing Threat Dynamics building occupies approximately 7,000 square feet, including 1,000
square feet of retail, some office space, and a warehouse space that accommodates training classes.

The existing leasable area at the new location is approximately 12,0001 square feet, which includes
space for training classes, simulation rooms, warehouse space, a live fire training range, and a
mezzanine.

The remainder of this memorandum describes the data collection process and estimated trip
generation for the existing and proposed site locations.


DATA COLLECTION
The unique land use combination (office, warehouse, retail) of Threat Dynamics is not well represented
by applying empirical data from the standard reference, Trip Generation, published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers. To understand the trip generation characteristics of the existing Threat
Dynamics site during the weekday p.m. peak hour, turning movement traffic volume counts were
collected at the existing site's two site driveways and at the proposed future business location
intersection. These counts were collected by Quality Counts, LLC on Thursday, January 16, 2014 during
the weekday p.m. peak hour (4:00-6:00 p.m.) and are provided at the conclusion of this memorandum
as Attachment "A."


TRIP GENERATION
As described previously, Threat Dynamics is relocating to a building offering additional training space to
accommodate existing demand; as such, the business owners do not anticipate increased business with
the relocation. Additional trip generation above and beyond what is occurring today is not anticipated
and existing trips are expected to relocate to the new site. Table 1 summarizes the turning movement
counts for Threat Dynamics during the weekday p.m. peak hour (note that the counts for the two
driveways at the existing site have been combined, as they both lead to the same parking lot). The peak
hour for the driveways at the current location was found to occur from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m.

As shown in Table 1, the existing site generates three trips during the weekday p.m. peak hour2.

TRIP IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND CAP ORDINANCE
Based on the driveway volumes at the Threat Dynamics driveways, a trip impact assessment was
prepared to address the impact to the Oregon Street/Tualatin-Sherwood Road intersection. An existing
City of Sherwood Capacity Allocation Ordinance (CAP 2000-1104) has identified this site and developed
a maximum number of allowable trips of 43 trips per acre based on land use. The trips observed at the
existing Threat Dynamics site (Table 1) were added to the trips into and out of the proposed site to
estimate the new trip rate. The calculations are shown below in Table 2.

Table 2 ­ Observed Weekday P.M. Peak Hour Trip Generation at the Proposed Industrial Site

                                                                             Weekday PM Peak Hour Trips

    Proposed Industrial Site       4:30 ­ 5:30 p.m.             16                      21                   37
    Existing Threat Dynamics       5:00 ­ 6:00 p.m.              2                       1                   3
    Total Trips                                                 18                      22                   40



As shown in Table 2, the proposed site is estimated to have approximately 40 trips during the weekday
p.m. peak hour with the relocation. Based on the total area of the proposed site (5.72 acres), the
resulting trip rate for the site after the relocation would be 40 trips per 5.72 acres, or approximately 7
trips per acre. As such, the proposed relocation does not exceed the CAP Ordinance.

As part of the CAP Ordinance assessment for this particular site, any development that exceeds eight
trips during the weekday p.m. peak hour would be assessed a proportionate share cost to any
identified improvements at the Oregon Street/Tualatin-Sherwood Road intersection. Because the
relocation is expected to generate an additional three trips at the new site, fewer than the threshold of
eight trips, no assessment should be applied as a result of the CAP Ordinance 2000-1104.


SDC ASSESSMENT
A preliminary SDC assessment was prepared by City of Sherwood staff to estimate potential costs to
Threat Dynamics as a result of the relocation. The original assessment (dated January 10, 2014)
projected a net system development charge of approximately $12,4573 and was based on various



2
    While not anticipated, even if the proposed Threat Dynamic building generated trips at a linear rate proportionate to
building size, the larger building would only generate up to five trips based on the current building trip rate of 0.43
trips/1,000 square feet. A p.m. peak hour trip increase is not anticipated given the smaller retail component and no
anticipated changes in staffing.

    This estimate assumes that the original SDCs have been paid for the existing light industrial building and the $12,457
is an increase based on credit for the existing light industrial building.

assumptions prior to data collection, including assumptions related to land use intensity. Specifically,
City staff developed a preliminary traffic impact fee assuming classification of the new building as a
light industrial use and assessing trips per the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (Institute of
Transportation Engineers, 2012). Also, it should be noted that City staff applied a building size of 10,500
square feet (based on impervious area), as shown in the January 2014 preliminary SDC estimate. This
estimate has been provided in Attachment "B" for reference purposes only and should be revisited
based on the data and conclusions of this study.

Based on the observed trip generation of Threat Dynamics, the trip generation of the proposed use is
lower than a comparable light industrial building. Table 3 below summarizes the trip generation4 for a
typical 10,500 square-foot light industrial building.

We recommend the City develop the final system development charge assessment for Threat Dynamics
based on the data presented in this memorandum.

We trust the trip generation information presented in this memorandum adequately addresses City of
Sherwood requirements for the relocation of the Threat Dynamics business and that no further
transportation study is required. Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.

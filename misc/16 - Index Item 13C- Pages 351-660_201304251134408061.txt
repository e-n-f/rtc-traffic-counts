Executive Summary




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB) completed a master plan for approximately 27 acres of
property, generally bordered by the Willamette River to the east, High Street to the west, the Union
Pacific Railroad to the south, and 4th Avenue to the north. Approximately 15 acres of the site, primarily
an impervious utility operations yard today, will be developed in multiple phases. A rezone is proposed
to allow development of the site for mixed uses that will be more consistent with surrounding land uses
and extend downtown Eugene to the riverfront. The projected timeframe for complete build-out is
between 10 and 15 years.

Vehicle access to the site will continue to be provided primarily via 4th Avenue. Mill Street will be
extended south of 4th Avenue through the site to a point north of the railroad tracks. Similarly, the
existing EWEB Administrative Building driveway will be reconstructed as a local street that travels
southeast through the site to a proposed southern site access, a relocated signalized 8 th Avenue railroad
crossing.1 In addition, a new 5th Avenue extension is proposed to provide east-west connections
through the northern portion of the site. The proposed 5th Avenue extension would provide access to
the site from High Street at a new intersection located approximately 150 feet north of the railroad
tracks and the current eastern terminus of 5th Avenue.

New roadways will include sidewalks and pedestrian facilities that will serve day-to-day use within the
site and provide connectivity to the larger Eugene sidewalk and pedestrian network surrounding the
site. In addition, the site will include bicycle and pedestrian accessways to the Ruth Bascom Path, which
provides a pedestrian and bicycle friendly riverfront route through the site and connects to downtown
and destinations north of the Willamette River.

The results of this study indicate that the proposed EWEB Master Plan site can be redeveloped while
maintaining acceptable traffic operations and safety at the study intersections, assuming provision of
the recommended mitigation measures.




1   The EWEB Master Plan proposes relocating the existing at-grade railroad crossing located between Broadway
and 8th Avenue approximately 250 feet northwest to create a fourth leg to reconfigured 8 th Avenue/Hilyard Street
intersection.

Executive Summary



Findings

YEAR 2011 EXISTING CONDITIONS
              All of the study intersections operate acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
               hours, except 4th Avenue/Coburg Road. During the p.m. peak hour, westbound right-turn
               movement at this intersection currently operates at level of service “F” and over capacity
               (volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c) > 1.0).

              A review of historical crash data did not reveal any patterns or trends in the site vicinity
               that require mitigation associated with this project.


PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT PLAN
              Four redevelopment scenarios were prepared by Rowell Brokaw Architects, PC and
               Cameron McCarthy staff based on the original EWEB master plan work, market forecasts,
               and other in-process master planning efforts. All of the scenarios assume that any new
               development will be in addition to the existing EWEB Administrative Building and the
               Midgley Building.

              The redevelopment scenario with the highest trip generation is estimated to generate 6,090
               daily net new trips; 780 net new trips (655 inbound, 125 outbound) are projected to occur
               during the weekday a.m. peak hour and 790 net new trips (190 inbound, 600 outbound) are
               projected to occur during the weekday p.m. peak hour.


TRANSPORTATION PLANNING RULE (TPR) ANALYSIS
              The EWEB site consists of multiple parcels, which are currently zoned as a combination of
               Public Lands (PL), Light-Medium Industrial (I-2), Heavy Industrial (I-3), and Special District
               (S-W Whiteaker Special Area Zone) with Transit-Oriented District (TOD) and Water
               Resources Conservation (WR) overlays. Under the proposed map amendment, the
               properties would each change designation to a new Special Area Zone (SAZ) identified as
               Downtown Riverfront (S-DR), retaining the overlays.2



2   The proposed S-DR Downtown Riverfront SAZ is based on a streamlined and modified version of the C-2
Community Commercial zone designation with additional use restrictions, building height limitations, form based
standards, and incentives for mixed use projects. Further, the site properties currently zoned S-W will retain
their S-W zoning within the SAZ.

                                                                                     EWEB Record - Page 360
       Kittelson & Associates, Inc.                                                                       3
Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) Master Planned Development                                    October 2012
Executive Summary


              The estimated peak hour trip generation of the site under the proposed S-DR zoning is
               lower than the trip generation of a reasonable “worst-case” density under the existing
               zoning. As a result, the proposed rezone would not have a significant effect on the
               transportation system.

              No future year intersection operational analysis is required for TPR purposes given the
               reduced peak hour trip generation associated with the rezone proposal.


TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
              Future weekday morning and evening peak hour traffic conditions were analyzed for the
               horizon years 2021 and 2031 prior to site development (background traffic) and with site
               development (total traffic).

              The analysis assumed reconstruction of the 8th Avenue/Hilyard Street intersection in
               conjunction with site development as envisioned by the City of Eugene. EWEB will work
               with the City to procure funding for the improvement and subsequent development phases
               will determine the appropriate year of completion. It is expected that a variety of public and
               private funding sources may be used to fund the improvement given its benefits to both the
               EWEB site and the greater subarea.

              Under each condition evaluated (2021 and 2031 background and total traffic conditions) all
               but two of the study intersections are forecast to operate at acceptable levels of service
               during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

                     o     Westbound right-turn movements at the 4th Avenue/Coburg Road intersection
                           continue to operate at level of service “F” and over capacity (v/c > 1.0) during the
                           p.m. peak hour.

                     o     The eastbound right turn movements at the Coburg Road/3rd Avenue intersection
                           are projected to operate at level of service “F” during the weekday a.m. peak hour
                           before and after site development under year 2031 conditions. The movement will
                           be well under capacity and does not warrant signalization. Further, the EWEB site
                           redevelopment is not anticipated to add any trips to the failing eastbound right-turn
                           movement. The intersection operates acceptably under forecast 2021 conditions.

              Operations at the 4th Avenue/Coburg Road intersection were found to be restored to an
               acceptable level of service though provision of dual westbound right-turn lanes and
               signalization of the intersection’s northbound and westbound movements.


                                                                                        EWEB Record - Page 361
       Kittelson & Associates, Inc.                                                                          4
Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) Master Planned Development                                    October 2012
Executive Summary


                     o     Even with signalization and the addition of a second westbound right turn lane,
                           westbound and northbound movements will be over-capacity during the peak 15
                           minutes. As such, the new signal will be creating opportunities for each movement
                           to proceed under congested conditions. This finding is consistent with the City of
                           Eugene’s identification of Coburg Road as a future “congested corridor.”


Year 2031 Total Traffic Conditions
              With signalization and the addition of a second westbound right turn lane, the 4th
               Avenue/Coburg Road intersection is forecast to operate at an acceptable level of service
               during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours; however, both westbound right-turn and
               northbound through movements are forecast to operate over capacity (v/c > 1.0).


On-Site Circulation/Site-Access Operations
              Each of the key site driveway study intersections will function acceptably with the proposed
               traffic control devices.

              Proposed on-site bicycle and pedestrian facilities will serve day-to-day use within the site
               while providing connectivity to the larger bicycle and pedestrian networks surrounding the
               site and the Ruth Bascom Path to the west.


Recommendations
The following list provides a summary of the mitigation measures recommended as part of this
proposed development.

              The 4th Avenue/Coburg Road intersection should be improved in conjunction with initial
               redevelopment of the site. Recommended improvements include:

                    Retain right-in/right-out turn movement restrictions;

                    Provide dual right-turn lanes on 4th Avenue between the EWEB Headquarters Building
                     and Coburg Road (approximately 125 feet of storage);

                    Signalize westbound right turn movements on 4th Avenue and northbound through
                     movements on Coburg Road at the intersection (southbound movements would remain
                     unsignalized and pedestrian phases would not be provided because grade-separated
                     pedestrian/bicycle crossings are provided via 4th Avenue and the Southbank Ruth
                     Bascom path under the Ferry Street Bridge); and

                                                                                        EWEB Record - Page 362

              The 8th Avenue/Hilyard Street intersection should be reconstructed in conjunction with site
               development. Improvements should include:

                     o     Provision of a new highway-railroad crossing, including track panels, lights, gates,
                           audible warning devices, and upgraded railroad track detection as required by
                           ODOT Rail and/or Union Pacific Railroad;

                     o     Signalization of the 8th Avenue/Hilyard Street intersection, including pedestrian
                           movements;

                     o     Provision of a northbound right-turn lane that will offer storage for right-turn
                           vehicles queued on Hilyard Street during train passage.

              Shrubbery, landscaping, and above ground utilities near the internal intersections and site
               access points should be located and maintained to ensure adequate sight distance.

Additional details of the study methodology, findings, and recommendations are provided within this

Introduction




INTRODUCTION

Project Description
The Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB) completed a master plan for approximately 27 acres of
property, generally bordered by the Willamette River to the east, High Street to the west, the Union
Pacific Railroad to the south, and 4th Avenue to the north. Figure 1 shows the site vicinity. The site
formerly housed maintenance, operations, engineering, and administrative staff in the EWEB
headquarters building and accessory buildings.

In November 2010, EWEB relocated their maintenance, operations, and engineering staff to a new site
in West Eugene, retaining only administrative staff at the existing headquarters building. As a result,
much of the current site along the west bank of the Willamette River has been vacated, creating the
opportunity for redevelopment as a mixed use center node as recommended in TransPlan and adopted
city Growth Management Policies. Approximately 15 acres of the site, primarily an impervious utility
operations yard today, will be developed in multiple phases. A rezone is proposed to allow
development of the site with mixed uses that will be more consistent with surrounding land uses and
extend downtown Eugene to the riverfront.

The projected timeframe for complete build-out is between 10 and 15 years. At this time, the site
development phases are not yet defined. To ensure a reasonably conservative trip generation estimate,
full build-out of the Master Plan development scenarios will be evaluated for near-term (10 year) and
long-term (20 year) planning horizons.


Scope of the Report
This report presents a two-part transportation analysis for the EWEB site:

              A Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) analysis to determine whether the proposed rezone
               of the site will cause a “significant affect”, and

              A traffic impact study to examine the proposal and identify transportation infrastructure
               needs required to support development.

Introduction


These analyses determine the transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed EWEB
redevelopment and were prepared in accordance with the TPR (OAR 660-012-0060(1)) and the City of
Eugene traffic impact analysis requirements (as specified in City of Eugene Code Section 9.8680). In
addition, scoping direction was provided by City staff in a letter dated August 4, 2011. Based on the
code criteria and staff direction, weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour operations of the following
intersections were studied in detail:

          1. 3rd Avenue/Coburg Road Southbound Off-Ramp

          2. 4th Avenue/Coburg Road

          3. Mill Street /EWEB Parking Lot Driveways

          4. 4th Avenue/ EWEB Headquarters Building Driveway

          5. 4th Avenue/Mill Street/EWEB Parking Lot Driveway

          6. Mill Street/EWEB Overflow Parking Lot Driveways

          7. 4th Avenue/High Street

          8. High Street/Future 5th Avenue Extension (offset from existing 5th Avenue/High Street
               intersection)

          9. 5th Avenue/High Street

          10. 6th Avenue/High Street

          11. 7th Avenue/High Street

          12. 8th Avenue/Hilyard Street

          13. Broadway/Hilyard Street

This report summarizes analyses of the following transportation issues:

              Year 2011 existing land-use and transportation-system conditions within the site vicinity
               during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak periods;

              Trip generation potential for various site redevelopment scenarios and Transportation
               Planning Rule compliance;

              Developments and transportation improvements planned in the study area;

              Forecast year 2021 background traffic conditions (without site redevelopment) during the
               weekday a.m. and p.m. peak periods;

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.

Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried the proposed EWEB redevelopment site
and surrounding study area in May and June 2011. At that time, KAI collected information regarding
site conditions, adjacent land uses, existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in the study
area.


Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The EWEB site formerly housed EWEB maintenance, operations, and engineering in the EWEB
headquarters building and accessory buildings. The site continues to house administrative staff in the
EWEB headquarters building. Existing structures on the riverfront property include the 100,000 square
foot EWEB Headquarters Building, 49,000 square foot Operations Warehouse, 17,800 square foot
Vehicle Repair Shop, 21,000 square foot Communications and Equipment Repair Building, 18,600
square foot Midgley’s Building, and 28,000 square foot Steam Plant. The southeastern end of the
property holds the Willamette Substation and the former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site, both of
which will remain in EWEB ownership.

The EWEB Master Plan assumes that the existing EWEB Administrative Building and the Midgley
Buildings will be preserved.3 The majority of the property available for immediate redevelopment is the
approximately 12-acre Operations Yard, which has most recently been used to store power poles,
transformers and utility service vehicles. This area of the riverfront property is inaccessible to the
public in its present, secured state and is almost entirely impervious.


Transportation Facilities
Table 1 provides a summary of the roadway characteristics of the nearby regional transportation
facilities within the site vicinity. Figure 2 illustrates the existing lane configurations and traffic control
devices at the study intersections.



3   The Midgley Building is located on the southeast corner of High Street/4 th Avenue.

Traffic Volumes and Peak Hour Operations
In May 2011, manual turning movement counts were obtained for all of the existing study intersections
except for the 3rd Avenue/Coburg Road off-ramp, which was counted September 2011. All of the counts
used in this analysis were conducted on a typical mid-week day during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.)
and evening (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak time periods.

The system-wide morning and evening peak hours were found to occur between 7:40 a.m. and 8:40
a.m. and 4:40 p.m. and 5:40 p.m., respectively. Figures 3 and 4 summarize the existing weekday a.m.
and p.m. turning-movement counts. All volumes shown are rounded to the nearest five vehicles per
hour. Appendix “A” contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.

LEVEL OF SERVICE DESCRIPTION & OPERATING STANDARDS
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the
procedures stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. A description of level of service and the criteria
by which they are determined is presented in Appendix “B”. Appendix “B” also indicates how level of
service is measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service.

To ensure that this analysis was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, the peak 15-minute flow
rate during the peak hour analysis periods was used in the evaluation of all intersection levels of
service. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to occur for 15 minutes out
of each average peak hour. Traffic conditions during other typical weekday hours and throughout most
weekends will likely be better than those described in this report.

Level of service analyses in this report for all-way and two-way stop-controlled intersections are based
on the intersection’s ability to accommodate the most difficult, or critical, approach as overall
intersection level of service is not defined by the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. Level of service
analyses for signalized intersections in this report are based on the average control delay per vehicle
entering the intersection. Per TransPlan (Reference 2), the City of Eugene bases intersection operations
on level of service (LOS). City of Eugene standards require that intersections operate at level of service
“E” or better (less than 80 seconds of average per vehicle control delay) within the Central Area
Transportation Study Area Boundary (Reference 3), which includes the EWEB site and all study
intersections. Elsewhere, the City requires that intersections operate at level of service “D” or better
(less than 55 seconds of average per vehicle control delay).


CURRENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Figures 3 and 4 summarize the level-of-service analysis for the study intersections under the weekday
a.m. and p.m. peak hour existing traffic conditions. All of the study intersections currently operate
acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, except 4th Avenue/Coburg Road. During the
p.m. peak hour, westbound right-turn movements at this intersection currently operate at level of
service “F” and over capacity (volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c) > 1.0). Appendix “C” includes the level-of-
service worksheets under year 2011 existing traffic conditions.


TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS
A preliminary traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted based on peak hour counts obtained in May
2011. Traffic signal warrants 1, 2, and 3 were reviewed as described in the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD) for the eight-hour vehicular volume, four-hour vehicular volume, and peak
                                                                                  EWEB Record - Page 377

hour vehicular volume (Reference 4). Westbound right-turn volumes on 4th Avenue were adjusted in
accordance with the procedure described in the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) Analysis
Procedures Manual (Reference 5), which discounted 122 of the westbound right-turn traffic volume. Per
the MUTCD procedures, all three traffic signal warrants are met at the intersection under existing
traffic conditions. Appendix “C” contains the traffic signal warrant worksheets.


RAILROAD OPERATIONS
The Union Pacific Railroad operates through the study area and crosses two roadways in the site
vicinity (High Street and 8th Avenue) as shown in Figure 1. The existing railroad crossings at High Street
and 8th Avenue have active control devices including flashing lights, bells, and gates that notify the
public of a train. The 8th Avenue railroad crossing is operated in coordination with the adjacent 8th
Avenue/Hilyard Street signalized intersection. Due to equipment limitations, no pedestrian crosswalks
are currently provided at the signalized 8th Avenue/Hilyard Street traffic signal.

Count data collected in 2002 and provided by City of Eugene Public Works staff indicates that the Union
Pacific Railroad corridor carried 15 freight trains per day between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
with 48 to 94 cars pulled and/or pushed by 2 to 9 locomotives. The freight trains blocked the 8th
Avenue/Hilyard Street crossing for between 2.5 to 7 minutes as they each passed and are not
programmed by time of day. Passenger rail service is also provided through the area, though the
passenger train blockages tend to be much shorter in duration due to the relatively short length of the
passenger train consists.


CRASH DATA REVIEW
The crash histories of the respective study intersections were reviewed in an effort to identify potential
intersection safety issues. Crash data for the study intersections were obtained from ODOT for the five-
year period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2009. Table 2 summarizes the reported
crashes at each of the study intersections during this five-year period in terms of collision type and
frequency. It also includes the crash frequency and crash rate for each intersection.

 A crash rate greater than 1.0 crashes/MEV at signalized intersections can be considered an indicator
 that a potential geometric or operational issue may exist and that further evaluations should be
 conducted. As shown, all crash rates are well below 1.0 crashes/MEV, and the crash data identified no
 fatalities reported at the study intersections during the five-year period.

 The crashes at each intersection were analyzed to identify patterns that may reflect potential
 intersection safety deficiencies. Crashes were examined based on crash type, direction, and severity, as
 well as weather and roadway surface conditions, lighting, time of day, day of week, and year. Any
 identified patterns are discussed in the following paragraphs

 Among the twelve crashes reported at 4th Avenue and Coburg Road, eleven were classified as rear-end
 collisions. Of these, eight involved northbound vehicles stopped on 4th Avenue waiting to make a right-
 turn onto Coburg Road. Two involved vehicles making a right-turn from 4th Avenue and rear-ending
 stopped or slowing vehicles on Coburg Road. Future improvements at the intersection discussed later
 in this report may improve safety at this intersection.

 Ten crashes were reported at the intersection of 6th Avenue and High Street. Seven of these were
 classified as turning movement collisions. Four of the seven turning movement collisions involved

vehicles at the split westbound approach making improper right turns and striking vehicles continuing
straight through the intersection. Three angle collisions at this intersection involved northbound
vehicles on High Street disregarding the traffic signal and striking westbound vehicles on 6th Avenue.

Fourteen crashes were reported at the intersection of 7th Avenue and High Street. Nine of these crashes
were classified as angle collisions; eight involved vehicles disregarding the traffic signal (four
southbound and four eastbound) and one involved a vehicle traveling the wrong way on High Street.
Four crashes were classified as turn crashes; two involved westbound vehicles making improper left
turns and two involved northbound vehicles making improper right turns.

Fourteen crashes were reported at the intersection of Broadway Street and Hilyard Street. Nine of
these crashes were angle collisions involving northbound vehicles. Two of the collisions were
attributed to drivers not yielding the right-of-way; seven were attributed to drivers disregarding the
traffic signal or inattention. Three of the crashes were considered turning movement collisions
involving northbound vehicles. All three were attributed to drivers disregarding the traffic signal or
other traffic control device. The one pedestrian crash occurred in the westbound direction and was a
result of the driver not yielding the right of way. The Broadway/Hilyard Street intersection was
recently reconstructed and restriped, which may improve safety at this intersection in the future.

Based on the 2005 to 2009 crash data, none of the study intersections have a crash rate greater than 1.0
crashes/MEV. Rear-end collisions were identified as the predominant crash type at the 4th
Avenue/Coburg Road intersection; future improvements at the intersection discussed later in this
report may improve safety at this intersection. No other patterns at the intersections indicate the need
for safety-related improvements. The crash data used in this analysis provided by ODOT are provided in
Appendix “D”.

Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) Analysis




TRANSPORTATION PLANNING RULE (TPR) ANALYSIS
The TPR is a state planning rule that institutes criteria under which the transportation impacts of a
post-acknowledgement plan amendment and zoning map amendment must be evaluated (OAR 660-
012-0060(1)). Per the TPR, a two-step review process is required. The first step is to determine if there
will be a significant affect on surrounding transportation facilities associated with the proposed
amendment. In the event that there is a significant affect, then the local government must put in place
measures as provided in OAR 660-012-0060(2), unless the amendment is allowed under sections (3),
(9) or (10) of OAR 660-012-0060. However, if the trip generation potential of a particular site is not
expected to increase as a result of the proposed amendment, no additional analysis is necessary to
satisfy the TPR.

A TPR analysis was conducted to determine if the proposed zone change could result in an increase in
potential trips generated by the site beyond that which would occur through reasonable “worst case”
development of the site under the existing designation. Based on this analysis, rezoning the property to
S-DR and developing to a reasonable “worst-case” density would not have a significant effect on the
transportation system. The reasonable “worst-case” trip generation impacts of the proposed rezone
activities demonstrate a reduced peak hour impact to the transportation system as compared to
redevelopment under the existing zoning. No future year intersection operational analysis is required
for TPR purposes given the reduced peak hour trip generation associated with the rezone proposal.
Details of the TPR review methodology and findings are presented below.


Existing and Proposed Zoning
The EWEB site consists of multiple parcels, which are currently zoned as a combination of Public Lands
(PL), Light-Medium Industrial (I-2), Heavy Industrial (I-3), and Special District (S-W Whiteaker Special
Area Zone) with Transit-Oriented District (TOD) and Water Resources Conservation (WR) overlays.
The majority of the site is zoned PL, which permits development of accessory uses, public uses
operated by a public agency (e.g. government offices, libraries), and select public uses not operated by
public agencies (e.g. community centers, gardens, athletic fields). Portions of the site are zoned I-1 and
I-3, which permit development of a variety of public, commercial, and industrial uses. Per the City
Zoning Code, retail and service commercial uses are a conditional use in the PL District and are limited
in size and scope to those primarily serving the permitted uses within one-half mile.

Under the proposed map amendment, the properties would each change designation to a new Special
Area Zone (SAZ), identified as Downtown Riverfront (S-DR) with the exception of the S-W zoned areas.

Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) Analysis


The S-DR designation is based on a modified version of the Community Commercial (C-2) zone, for
mixed use development.4


Trip Generation Potential Comparison
For analysis purposes, the proposed mixed use center was treated as one site. Using the standard
reference manual, Trip Generation, 8th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE, Reference 6), the potential site trip generation ( including pass-by and internal trips) was
estimated for:

              An assumed reasonable “worst case” under the current PL designation, and

              Four (4) potential development scenarios for the site under the proposed S-DR designation.

The four scenarios were developed by Rowell Brokaw Architects, PC and Cameron McCarthy staff based
on the original EWEB master plan work, market forecasts, and other in-process master planning efforts.
All of the scenarios assume that new development will be in addition to the existing EWEB
Administrative Building and the Midgley Building. Table 3 summarizes the proposed land uses in each
of the potential development scenarios evaluated.

Based on the existing PL designation, a reasonable “worst-case” scenario for the existing designation
was assumed to be 460,000 square feet of new general office space and 9,000 square feet of support
services (day care center and bank) in addition to the EWEB Administrative Building and the Midgley
Building currently on the site. This building size estimate for the office and support services was
derived by assuming a three-story building (no maximum building height is defined in the PL
designation) with a floor-to-area ratio (FAR) of approximately 0.7 located across the approximately 15
acres of the site expected to be redeveloped.




4   The proposed S-DR Downtown Riverfront SAZ is based on a streamlined and modified version of the C-2
Community Commercial zone designation with additional use restrictions, building height limitations, form based
standards, and incentives for mixed use projects. Further, the site properties currently zoned S-W will retain
their S-W zoning within the SAZ.

The C-2 zoning, which is the basis for S-DR, allows for the development of a mix of retail, office, and
residential uses. Based on an evaluation of the estimated trip generation of the four potential
development scenarios shown in Table 3, the “Civic Center” scenario was identified as the reasonable
“worst-case” scenario for the proposed S-DR designation. Appendix “E” contains the trip generation
estimates developed for each of the four potential development scenarios. Appendix “F” contains the trip
internalization calculations for the existing “worst-case” and four potential development scenarios.

Table 4 shows the estimated trip generation comparison between the reasonable “worst-case”
scenarios for the existing PL zoning and the proposed S-DR zoning. The daily trip estimates in Table 4
have been rounded to the nearest 10 while the peak hour estimates were rounded to the nearest 5.

As shown in Table 4, the trip generation potential of reasonable “worst-case” development under the
proposed Downtown Riverfront (S-DR) zoning will result in fewer peak hour trips than “worst-case”
development under the existing public lands (PL) zoning. As such, it is concluded that the proposed
rezone can comply with the TPR. No additional intersection analyses are required to measure the
potential for a significant affect.

As noted in Table 5, there are 11 criteria that apply to Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments. Of
these, Criteria #1 and #4 are applicable to the proposed land use action. These criteria are provided
below in italics with our response shown in standard font.

     (1) A plan or land use regulation amendment significantly affects a transportation facility if it would:

            (a) Change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility (exclusive
            of correction of map errors in an adopted plan);

            (b) Change standards implementing a functional classification system; or

            (c) Result in any of the effects listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this subsection based on
            projected conditions measured at the end of the planning period identified in the adopted
            Transportation System Plan (TSP). As part of evaluating projected conditions, the amount of
            traffic projected to be generated within the area of the amendment may be reduced if the
            amendment includes an enforceable, ongoing requirement that would demonstrably limit traffic
            generation, including, but not limited to, transportation demand management. This reduction may
            diminish or completely eliminate the significant effect of the amendment.

                                                                                                             EWEB Record - Page 386

Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) Analysis


                     (A) Types or levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the functional
                     classification of an existing or planned transportation facility;

                     (B) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility such that it
                     would not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive plan; or

                     (C) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility that is
                     otherwise projected to not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or
                     comprehensive plan.

Response: The transportation impacts of the proposed zoning map amendments will have a reduced
peak hour impact to the site access and local transportation system compared to development under
the existing zoning. As such, the proposed zone change does not have a significant impact for TPR
purposes. The functional classifications of roadways in the study area are also unaffected by the
proposed zone change.

(4) Determinations under sections (1)-(3) of this rule shall be coordinated with affected transportation
facility and service providers and other affected local governments.

Response: The project team is coordinating the assessment of the transportation impacts with the City
of Eugene.

Traffic Impact Analysis




TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
The traffic impact analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system may operate assuming
build out of the proposed EWEB redevelopment. The impact of traffic generated by the proposed
redevelopment activities during typical weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours was examined as follows:

              Planned developments and transportation improvements in the site vicinity were identified
               and reviewed;

              Year 2021 background traffic conditions (assumed build-out year of the proposed
               redevelopment without site-generated traffic) were analyzed at each of the study
               intersections;

              Future peak hour site-generated trips were estimated for build-out of the site;

              A trip distribution pattern was developed and used to assign site-generated trips to the
               study intersections;

              Year 2021 total traffic conditions (assumed build-out year of the proposed redevelopment
               with site-generated traffic) were analyzed at each of the study intersections;

              Year 2031 background traffic conditions (ten years after build-out of the proposed
               redevelopment without site-generated traffic) were analyzed at each of the study
               intersections;

              Year 2031 total traffic conditions (ten years after build-out of the proposed redevelopment
               with site-generated traffic) were analyzed at each of the study intersections; and,

              On-site circulation and site-access operations were evaluated.


Year 2021 Background Traffic Conditions
The year 2021 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system may
operate without the proposed EWEB redevelopment. This analysis accounts for traffic attributed to
planned developments within the study area and includes general growth in the region, but does not
include traffic from the proposed site redevelopment.


PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
Conversations with City of Eugene staff identified no funded transportation capacity improvements in
the site vicinity. The only currently proposed development activity identified in the site vicinity is a

                                                                                     EWEB Record - Page 389

proposal to convert a portion of a warehouse in the SE corner of 8th and Ferry to a fitness center
(Crossfit Training). This facility is anticipated to serve from 2 to 15 students with one instructor
between the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily. The fitness center will primarily serve Federal
Courthouse employees and other nearby users who already travel to the site for work. As a result, this
development is anticipated to have negligible traffic impacts; most trips generated by this development
are expected to be walking trips and are not expected to add to existing traffic volumes on the site.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES
While no development activities were noted that will add significantly to existing traffic volumes in the
immediate site vicinity, a one percent annual growth rate was assumed at the study intersections to
account for local and regional traffic growth.5 Accordingly, the year 2011 existing traffic volumes were
increased by a factor of 10.4 percent to forecast year 2021 background traffic volumes. The 2021 a.m.
and p.m. peak hour background traffic volumes are summarized in Figures 5 and 6.


LEVEL-OF-SERVICE ANALYSIS
The 2021 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figures 5 and 6 were
used to prepare an operational analysis at each study intersection. Similar to existing conditions, all of
the study intersections are forecast to operate acceptably during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, except
4th Avenue/Coburg Road. During the p.m. peak hour, westbound right-turn movements at this
intersection continue to operate at level of service “F” and over capacity (v/c > 1.0). As discussed
previously, the volumes at the 4th Avenue/Coburg Road intersection meet traffic signal warrants under
2011 conditions and would continue to warrant signalization in the future. Appendix “G” contains the
year 2021 background traffic operations worksheets.




5   The average annual growth rate derived from the 2031 model volumes provided by Lane Council of
Governments (LCOG) was 1.04 percent. Growth rates at individual intersections ranged from 0.4% to 2.4%.

Proposed Development Plan
Redevelopment of the EWEB site could begin as early as 2012. Approximately 15 acres of the site,
primarily an impervious utility operations yard today, will be developed in multiple phases. The
projected timeframe for complete build-out is between 10 and 15 years. At this time, the site
development phases are not yet defined.

Four potential redevelopment scenarios (summarized in the Transportation Planning Rule section of
this report) were developed by Rowell Brokaw Architects, PC and Cameron McCarthy staff based on the
original EWEB master plan work, market forecasts, and other in-process master planning efforts.6 For
the purpose of the future operational analyses presented in this report, the “Civic Center” scenario was
used. The “Civic Center” scenario resulted in the highest trip generation of the four redevelopment
scenarios evaluated. This scenario includes a mixed-use redevelopment of the EWEB site, including 53
new townhome and apartment residential units, 315,000 square feet of new office building space,
22,000 square feet of new retail space, and 14,000 square feet of restaurant space.


TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
Figure 7 shows the transportation network proposed to serve the redevelopment of the property.
Vehicle access to the site will continue to be provided via 4th Avenue. Mill Street will be extended south
of 4th Avenue through the site to a point north of the railroad tracks. Similarly, the existing EWEB
Administrative Building driveway will be reconstructed as a local street that travels southeast through
the site to a proposed southern site access, at a relocated signalized 8th Avenue railroad crossing.

In addition, a new 5th Avenue extension is proposed to provide east-west connections through the
northern portion of the site. The proposed 5th Avenue extension would provide access to the site from
High Street at a new intersection located approximately 150 feet north of the railroad tracks and the
current eastern terminus of 5th Avenue. Figure 8 shows the anticipated lane configurations and traffic
controls at study intersections after full build-out of the site redevelopment.




6   All of the scenarios assume that new development will be in addition to the existing EWEB Administrative
Building and the Midgley Building.

Railroad Crossing Relocation
The analysis presented in this report assumes reconstruction of the 8th Avenue/Hilyard Street
intersection in conjunction with site development as envisioned by the City of Eugene. EWEB will work
with the City to procure funding for the improvement and subsequent development phases will
determine the appropriate year of completion. It is expected that a variety of public and private funding
sources may be used to fund the improvement given its benefits to both the EWEB site and the greater
subarea.

The EWEB Master Plan accommodates relocating the existing at-grade railroad crossing situated
between Broadway and 8th Avenue approximately 250 feet northwest to create a fourth leg to the
reconfigured 8th Avenue/Hilyard Street intersection. The relocation will allow for several
enhancements including:

                The grade crossing relocation will align with the existing 8th Avenue, allowing for signalized
                movements to and from the existing 8th Avenue intersection;

               The new traffic signal will accommodate full pedestrian movements (in addition to
                improvements at the intersection, the new crossing will require upgrading the current
                railroad track detection to provide adequate pedestrian clearance time prior to train
                arrivals which in turn is expected to trigger detection changes to the north at High Street);
                and

               Provision of a northbound right-turn lane that will offer storage for right-turn vehicles
                queued on Hilyard Street during train passage7.

A conceptual illustration of the reconfigured intersection is shown in Appendix H.




7   During train passage events when the railroad crossing is blocked, motorists will have the option of stopping at
the crossing and waiting for the train to clear or continuing north on Hilyard Street and accessing the EWEB site
via other routes, including Coburg Road. The variability in train arrival times, train length, the timing of a
motorist’s arrival at the crossing, and other factors make it difficult to predict how many motorists will queue and
wait to turn right while a train passes through. The conceptual right-turn lane design shown on Hilyard Street can
readily accommodate seven passenger cars and can be constructed within the existing right-of-way, maximizing
the storage provided in the context of the intersection location and right-if-way available to the project.

TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation estimates (including pass-by and internal trips) were prepared for the existing site
uses and the four potential site development scenarios using the standard reference manual, Trip
Generation, 8th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). Table 6 shows the
estimated trip generation for existing uses and the highest trip generation development scenario under
the proposed zoning (Civic Center scenario). The final line of the table shows the potential change in
net new trips between the existing and proposed development.

 (Proposed Uses - Existing Uses)
*ITE “general office” trip generation includes services such as banks, restaurants, and other support services.


The trips shown in Table 6 reflect an overall increase in the net new daily and weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hour site trip generation compared to existing conditions. City of Eugene Code Section 9.8670
requires a traffic impact study for any development that generates an increase of 100 trips during any
peak hour.

For the purpose of this analysis, the development scenario with the highest total daily trip generation
was evaluated. By comparison, if a different development scenario is pursued, the site trip generation
would be reduced compared to the analysis presented in this report. In addition, this trip generation
estimate does not include a reduction for trips that will likely be made by non-auto modes (e.g. transit,
walking, biking) due to the mixed-use nature of the site or other trip reductions that could result from
travel demand management (TDM) strategies.

Traffic Impact Analysis


SITE TRIP DISTRIBUTION/TRIP ASSIGNMENT
The site-generated trips were distributed onto the study area roadway system based on travel demand
model data provided for the site by the Lane Council of Governments (LCOG) and existing travel
patterns.8 Figure 9 illustrates the estimated trip distribution pattern for the proposed development.

The estimated site-generated trips were assigned to the network by distributing the trips shown in
Table 6 according to the trip distribution pattern shown in Figure 9. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the
site-generated trips that are expected to use the roadway system during the weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hours. Note that the volumes shown in Figures 10 and 11 represent the anticipated increase in
site trips over the existing site trip generation (net new trip difference in Table 6) plus those additional
trips that reflect pass-by trips from E Broadway Street. Appendix “I” shows the weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hour pass-by trip assignments.




8   LCOG provided select zone assignment data for transportation analysis zones (TAZ) number 388. The TZA data
encompasses the EWEB master Plan site and included mixed-use development assumptions for the EWEB
property.

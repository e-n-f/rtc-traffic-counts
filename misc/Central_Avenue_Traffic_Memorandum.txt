Executive Summary

The study corridor within the scope of this project consists of Central Avenue from 8 th
Street to Goodlette Frank Road in the City of Naples, Florida. The purpose of the study
is to provide traffic analysis in support of potential improvements along Central
Avenue, as part of the city’s redevelopment plan.

Central Avenue is currently classified as a four-lane section, however, the portion of
Central Avenue included in this project consists of several typical sections.

   ·   8th Street to 9th Street / US 41 – 2 Lane Roadway (1 EB / 1 WB) with exclusive
       eastbound and westbound left turn lanes.
   ·   9th Street / US 41 and 10th Street – 3 Lane Roadway (1 EB / 2 WB) with exclusive
       eastbound and westbound left turn lanes.
   ·   10th Street to 12th Street – 4 Lane Roadway (2 EB / 2 WB), no exclusive turn lanes
   ·   12th Street to Goodlette Frank Road – 3 Lane Roadway (1 EB / 2 WB), exclusive
       eastbound left turn lane.

Existing data were collected at two locations and supplemented by data from the City’s
count station along Central Avenue. Turning movement data were also collected at the
five intersections within the study area (8th Street, 9th Street / US 41, 10th Street, 12th
Street and Goodlette Frank Road).

Based upon discussion with the City of Naples, an identified improvement within the
study area includes the connection of 3 rd Avenue South to Goodlette Frank Road, which
will provide cross connectivity from US 41 to Goodlete Frank Road.

The Proposed Alternative consists of the following modifications:


   ·   Dedicated bicycle lanes in both east and west directions.
   ·   Raised medians.
   ·   On-street parking
   ·   Exclusive turn lanes along Central Avenue, where appropriate and conducive to
       traffic operations and safety.
   ·   Single lane roundabouts at 8th Street and 10th Street
   ·   Addition of a second eastbound left turn lane and an exclusive northbound right
       turn lane at Goodlette Frank Road.

Traffic analyses were performed, using seasonally adjusted data, for both opening year
(2016) and future year (2035) scenarios for both the No-build Alternative and the
Proposed Alternative. Future growth and traffic projections were based on data
obtained from multiple sources, including historical FDOT data, the Lee-Collier Travel
Demand Model and count data along Central Avenue (as provided by the City of Naples


                                                                                               i

count program). Under the Proposed Alternative, the study corridor is anticipated to
operate at an acceptable level of service and with available capacity in future year
conditions.

The signalized intersections (at 9th Street / US 41 and Goodlette Frank Road), analyzed
using seasonally adjusted data and inclusive of identified future developments within
the area, are anticipated to operate at acceptable levels of service. In addition, traffic
queues at 9th Street / US 41 are not generally anticipated to extend through the
roundabouts at 8th Street and 10th Street during the AM and PM Peak hours.

1     Introduction

This Traffic Technical Memorandum has been prepared by Kimley-Horn and
Associates, Inc. (KHA) on behalf of the City of Naples. The study corridor within the
scope of this project consists of Central Avenue from 8 th Street to Goodlette Frank Road
in the City of Naples, Florida. The project location is shown in Figure 1.

The purpose of the study is to provide a traffic analysis in support of potential
improvements along Central Avenue, as part of the city’s redevelopment plan. The
traffic memorandum includes the evaluation and documentation of existing conditions
and the roadway characteristics, as well as the development of design traffic volumes
for short-term (2016) and long-term (2035) future scenarios.


1.1   Description of Project

Central Avenue, an east-west local collector roadway, begins at the beaches to the
west and terminates just east of Goodlette Frank Road into the future Baker Park area.
Central Avenue is one of several east-west roadways which provide connection
between the two major north-south arterials in the area, US 41 and Goodlette Frank
Road, which are both 6-lane major arterials.

To the west of 8th Street, Central Avenue is a two-lane roadway with raised medians
and bicycle lanes. The portion of Central Avenue within the scope of this project is an
undivided roadway, with varying typical sections, no bicycle lanes, limited right-of-way
and several existing driveways which contribute to traffic operations and safety issues.
Figure 1 shows the project location.


1.2   Objective

The objective of this Technical Memorandum is to provide the City of Naples with the
analyses used to determine short term and long term traffic projections along Central
Avenue in support of the proposed improvements. Annual Average Daily Traffic
(AADT), Peak Hour Volume (PHV), intersection, and roadway Level of Service (LOS) are
detailed for existing conditions. In addition, this report includes the development of
future traffic forecasts and Level of Service analyses for the No Build and Build
Alternatives. Intersection operations analysis and anticipated turning movement queue
lengths are also documented.




                                                                                    Page 1

1.3   Methodology

The methodology for this report includes steps to collect existing data from multiple
sources, reviewing the adopted travel demand model for validity, develop existing year
design traffic volumes, and provide an operational analysis for existing roadways and
intersections. In addition, this report includes steps to review future land use data,
travel demand modeling, and projected growth to determine the anticipated future
year traffic volumes and future year operational analyses for existing roadways and
intersections.

3       Existing Conditions

An analysis of existing operating conditions was conducted for the study area
segments and intersections. Data collection was conducted to establish existing
geometry, intersection turning movement counts, and segment counts. The results of
this data collection are presented in the subsequent tables and figures.


3.1     Existing Geometry

The existing geometry in the study area was obtained through review of aerial imagery,
and confirmed through field observations, and is shown in Figure 3. Central Avenue is
currently classified as a four-lane section, however, the portion of Central Avenue
included in this project consists of several typical sections.

    ·   8th Street to 9th Street / US 41 – 2 Lane Roadway (1 EB / 1 WB) with exclusive
        eastbound and westbound left turn lanes.
    ·   9th Street / US 41 and 10th Street – 3 Lane Roadway (1 EB / 2 WB) with exclusive
        eastbound and westbound left turn lanes.
    ·   10th Street to 12th Street – 4 Lane Roadway (2 EB / 2 WB), no exclusive turn lanes
    ·   12th Street to Goodlette Frank Road – 3 Lane Roadway (1 EB / 2 WB), exclusive
        eastbound left turn lane.

Central Avenue ends just east of Goodlette Frank Road. To the west, Central Avenue is
a two-lane divided roadway with raised medians (west of 6 th Street) and bicycle lanes
extending to the beach areas.

3.2     Traffic Count Information

Traffic counts were conducted in September 2014. Raw counts were adjusted by a
seasonal factor based on information from FDOT’s 2014 Florida Traffic Information
(FTI) publication. Intersection turning movement counts were conducted for each of the
following study intersections:

    ·   Central Avenue   &   8th Street
    ·   Central Avenue   &   9th Street / US 41
    ·   Central Avenue   &   10th Street
    ·   Central Avenue   &   12th Street
    ·   Central Avenue   &   Goodlette Frank Road

The counts were conducted during the AM Peak (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and PM Peak
(4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) periods. Segment counts were also conducted within the study
area. 72-Hour Volume Counts were conducted at the following locations:


                                                                                      Page 5

   ·   Central Avenue between 8th Street and US 41
   ·   Central Avenue between 12th Street and Goodlette Frank Road

Turning movement and segment count locations are shown in Figure 4.

The adjusted turning movement volumes for the AM and PM Peak Hours are shown in
Figure 5 and are detailed in Appendix A. Data from FTI is also included in Appendix
A.

In addition, quarterly counts published by the City were also used to supplement the
segment analysis. This count station is located on Central Avenue between 9 th Street /
US 41 and 10th Street. Traffic count summaries are provided in Appendix B.

3.3    Year 2014 Intersection Level of Service Analysis

Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to describe the operational
conditions of an intersection, and is based on both delay and volume-to-capacity
ratios. The following table shows the delay ranges per LOS grade, per the Highway
Capacity Manual.

                               Table 1: Level of Service Thresholds

3.4     Year 2014 Arterial Analysis

Central Avenue was evaluated using FDOTs 2012 Generalized Volume Tables and
available traffic data provided by the City. The City conducts quarterly traffic counts at
one location along Central Avenue (between 9 th Street / US 41 and 10th Street). Table 3
below shows the 2014 raw data and corresponding seasonally adjusted Average
Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) values for the City count location.

4     Development of Design Characteristics

Design Characteristics were developed using both the Project Traffic Forecasting (PTF)
Handbook and engineering judgement. The primary traffic design characteristics are
the Standard K factor and Design Hour Directional Demand (D). These characteristics
will be used in developing the future traffic volumes and conducting future operational
analysis.

4.1   Standard K Factor

The K Factor defines the proportion of daily volume that occurs within the peak hour.
FDOT has adopted a Standard K Factor to use in analysis based on area and facility
type. For arterials and highway within an urbanized area, the recommended K Factor is
9.0%. Therefore, a K factor of 9.0% will be used for the study area roadways.

4.2   D Factor
The Peak Hour Directional Demand (D) Factor is used to determine the directional split
of traffic during the design hour. Table 5 contains a summary of the measured D for
study area roadways, based on the 72-hour volume counts that were conducted in May
2013. As shown in the table, the average measured D for Central Avenue is 64.16%,
based on the counts conducted. Historical D values for US 41 and Goodlette Frank
Road were obtained from FDOT’s FTI publication.

5       Development of Future Traffic Forecasts

Future traffic forecast volumes were developed for study area roadway segments.
Factors considered in the development of future traffic volumes include historic trends,
adopted future travel demand model volumes, population forecasts, and an
understanding of planned and programmed improvements.


5.1     Design Period

The following analysis years were used to evaluate conditions along the corridor:


    ·   Opening Year        –      2016
    ·   Future Year         –      2035


5.2     Programmed and Planned Improvements

A review was conducted of FDOT’s Five Year Work Program (2015-2019) and the
Collier County Metropolitan Planning Organizations (CMPO) Transportation
Improvement Program (2015-2019) to determine the planned and programmed
improvements in the study area. No capacity projects are currently programmed or
planned within the study area based upon this review.

Through discussion with City staff, an identified improvement within the vicinity of the
project includes the extension of 3 rd Avenue South to Goodlette Frank Road (3rd Avenue
South currently terminates at 12 th St). This extension would provide east-west
connectivity between US 41 and Goodlette Frank Road (in addition to Central Avenue
and 1st Avenue South), and provide additional access to these major arterials for local
traffic and direct access to the future Naples Square development.


5.3     Future Roadway Analysis Alternatives

The No Build scenario assumes no changes to the roadway in future conditions. The
Build traffic forecasts were developed assuming that Central Avenue, between 8 th Street
and Goodlette Frank Road, will be modified from a four-lane undivided roadway to a
two-lane divided roadway. In addition, the existing signalized intersections at 8 th Street
and 10th Street will be replaced by unsignalized roundabouts.




                                                                                     Page 13

5.4    Future Travel Demand

In order to evaluate future conditions on the study area roadways, existing traffic data
must be projected to future analysis years. Historical growth and model growth were
evaluated and compared to determine the most appropriate method for projecting
future traffic volumes, based on the available information within the study area.

In order to determine an appropriate growth rate to apply to future traffic along
Central Avenue, several data sources were evaluated utilizing data from FDOT, Lee
County / Collier County MPO and the City of Naples.

5.4.1 FDOT Historical Growth

Available FDOT count data was obtained for three count stations near the vicinity of
the project corridor. Historical AADT data were obtained for the most recent ten year
span to determine a growth trend in the area.

Historical AADT data for all three count sites are summarized in Table 6 below, and
are included in Appendix D.

5.4.2 Lee / Collier Travel Demand Model Growth

The Lee / Collier Travel Demand Model was reviewed to determine the expected
growth rate between the 2007 base model and the 2035 long term model.
Socioeconomic data from Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) located within the City of
Naples’ CRA district were considered in the analysis. Table 7 below highlights the
expected growth based upon two separate variables: Total Population and Total
Employment.

                                                                                                       Page 14

5.4.3 City of Naples Historical Growth

A review of historical growth along Central Avenue was performed utilizing traffic
count data (count station located between 9th Street / US 41 and 10th Street) from the
City of Naples. Table 8 below shows the Historical Annual Growth recorded over the
most recent 10 year period.

5.4.4 Conclusion

The review of growth highlights several key trends along Central Avenue and within the
immediate study area. Although the review of the demand model yielded an overall
growth rate of 2%, this represents the anticipated growth (based upon socio-economic
data) within the entire CRA area, taking into account that the downtown area is primed
for redevelopment. This growth also represents analysis zones that are outside of the
immediate vicinity of the study corridor (but still within the CRA) that may use US 41
and Goodlette Frank Road.

Comparatively, historic traffic along US 41, Goodlette Frank Road and 5 th Avenue South
shows a downward trend over the last ten years. Central Avenue, a local roadway,
serves local east-west travel, while US 41 and Goodlette Frank Road (6-lane major
arterials) primarily provides connectivity between the north and south parts of Collier
County. To account for these roadway characteristics the growth rates to be used in
the Future Conditions analyses are as follows:


   ·   2% annual growth along US 41 and Goodlette Frank Road
   ·   1% annual growth along Central Avenue
   ·   1% annual growth along 8th Street, 10th Street and 12th Street


5.5    Future AADT Volumes

Future AADT volumes were developed by applying the annual growth rate to the actual
roadway volumes along Central Avenue. This growth rate was applied to the existing
AADT along Central Avenue as shown in the table below.

Using the AADT from Section 3.4, Opening Year (2016) and Future Year (2035)
volumes were calculated and are shown in Table 9.

5.6   Intersection Design Hour Volumes

Future year intersection design hour volumes (DHV) were developed using the future
year AADT projections, in combination with the design characteristics, and the turning
movement counts collected at the study intersections. Raw volumes were seasonally
adjusted and grown to 2035 future year volumes. In addition, traffic from previously
identified developments/redevelopments, as provided by the City, were also included
for both AM and PM peak hour analyses.

The AM and PM design hour volumes for both Opening Year (2016) and Future Year
(2035) are included in Figure 6 and Figure 7. Turning movement development
worksheets are located in Appendix F.

6       Future Conditions Analysis

An analysis of future conditions was conducted for No Build and Build conditions for
Opening Year and Future Year scenarios.


6.1     Geometry – Proposed Alternative

The Proposed Alternative roadway geometry assumes that Central Avenue will be
modified from a four-lane undivided roadway to a two-lane divided roadway. Limits of
the widening are from 8th Street to the east of Goodlette Frank Road. Associated
intersection improvements include:


    ·   Dedicated bicycle lanes in both east and west directions.
    ·   Raised medians.
    ·   On-street parking.
    ·   Exclusive turn lanes along Central Avenue, where appropriate and conducive to
        traffic operations and safety.
    ·   Single lane roundabouts at 8th Street and 10th Street
    ·   Addition of a second eastbound left turn lane and an exclusive northbound right
        turn lane at Goodlette Frank Road.

Figure 8 shows the build conditions of the proposed roadway configuration. The
future Proposed Alternative corridor plan is shown in Appendix G.

  Table 11 shows the anticipated performance of the arterial as a comparison of the
  service volumes with the projected directional design hour volumes for each of the
  future analysis year. As shown in the table, all study area roadway segments under the
  No Build scenario are anticipated to operate with an acceptable LOS under Opening
  Year (2016) and Future Year (2035) conditions.

6.4     Queue Analysis – No Build Alternative

An analysis of the anticipated queue lengths (using Synchro) along Central Avenue, for
the No Build alternative, was performed and is shown in Table 12 below. These queues
represent the 95th percentile queue, for their respective movements, at the signalized
intersections. The 95th percentile queue is defined by the Highway Capacity Manual to
be “the queue length that has only a 5 percent probability of being exceeded during
the analysis time period.”

Based on this analysis, the anticipated queues at the intersections are not anticipated
to affect the upstream intersections (8th Street and 10th Street).

As shown in Table 13, under the Proposed Alternative conditions, the study
intersections are anticipated to operate with acceptable LOS in both Peak Hours.


6.6    Future Arterial LOS Analysis – Proposed Alternative

Table 14 shows the anticipated performance of the arterial as a comparison of the
service volumes with the projected directional design hour volumes for each of the
future analysis year.

As shown, all study area roadway segments under the Proposed Alternative scenario
are anticipated to operate with an acceptable LOS under Opening Year (2016) and
Future Year (2035) conditions.

It should be noted that the City of Naples gathers traffic data on a quarterly basis at
their count station along Cental Avenue (between 9 th Street / US 41 and 10th Street). For
comparison purposes only, Table 15 shows the operations of this segment of Central
Avenue, assuming the use of the raw unadjusted March 2014 count (highest of the
four quarterly counts).

the Proposed Alternative.

6.7   Queue Analysis – Proposed Alternative

An analysis of the anticipated queue lengths (using Synchro) along Central Avenue,
under the Proposed Alternative, was performed and is shown in Table 16 below.
Similar to the no-build condition, these queues represent the 95 th percentile queues at
the signalized intersections.

   Table 16: Future Year (2035) Proposed Alternative 95th percentile Queue Lengths

                                                  Turn Lane Queue Length (feet)

        Central Ave & Goodlette Frank Rd.   190         120          75            90



At the intersection of Central Avenue & 9 th Street / US 41, although the 95th percentile
queue lengths (eastbound and westbound left) are shown to have the potential to
exceed the available storage, the anticipated queues at this intersection are not
generally expected to extend through the upstream roundabouts (8 th Street and 10th
Street).




                                                                                        Page 26

7       Summary and Conclusions

This Design Traffic Technical Memorandum (DTTM) has been prepared to provide
design traffic volumes and traffic analysis for the Central Avenue Improvements
project.


8.3     Proposed Alternative

The Proposed Alternative roadway geometry assumes that Central Avenue will be
widened modified from a four-lane undivided roadway to a two-lane divided roadway
in the future conditions. Limits of the widening are from west of 8 th Street to the
Goodlette Frank Road. Associated intersection improvements include:


    ·   Dedicated bicycle lanes in both east and west directions.
    ·   Raised medians.
    ·   On-street parking.
    ·   Exclusive turn lanes along Central Avenue, where appropriate and conducive to
        traffic operations and safety.
    ·   Single lane roundabouts at 8th Street and 10th Street
    ·   Addition of a second eastbound left turn lane and an exclusive northbound right
        turn lane at Goodlette Frank Road.

All study area roadway segments under the Proposed Alternative scenario are
anticipated to operate at an acceptable LOS under Opening Year (2016), and Future
Year (2035) conditions.

Based on the intersection analyses, all study area intersections are anticipated to
operate acceptably under Opening Year (2016) and Future Year (2035) conditions.

Anticipated queue lengths at the signalized intersections are not generally expected to
extend through the roundabouts at 8th Street and 10th Street, under Opening Year
(2016) and Future Year (2035) conditions.

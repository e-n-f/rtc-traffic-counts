Introduction



1. INTRODUCTION
This traffic study summarizes the analysis of potential transportation impacts associated with the
proposed Shattuck Terrace Green Apartments, a commercial and residential mixed-use development,
at 2190 Shattuck Avenue in Downtown Berkeley, herein referred to as the “proposed Project”. The
study builds on the Preliminary Transportation Assessment (August 11, 2016) and was prepared
according to the approved scope of work included as Appendix A. The location of the proposed Project
is illustrated in Figure 1.

This study addresses the traffic, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, loading, emergency vehicle access and
construction related impacts of the proposed Project. Intersection Level of Service (LOS) is evaluated
for study intersections for the weekday AM (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and PM (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) peak
hours. Although not required by California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the effects of the
proposed Project on parking and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is included for informational purposes.

The analysis evaluates conditions under the following scenarios and identifies the transportation-
related impacts of the proposed Project:

          x     Existing (Year 2016);
          x     Baseline (Existing plus Approved);
          x     Baseline plus Project;
          x     Cumulative (Year 2040); and
          x     Cumulative plus Project.
The Baseline scenario reflects existing traffic conditions with approved projects using information
provided by the City of Berkeley. This scenario assumes completion of the proposed reconfiguration of
Shattuck Avenue, which would convert Shattuck Avenue (west) to two-way operations. The Cumulative
Conditions scenario reflects future (Year 2040) traffic conditions using outputs from the Alameda
County Transportation Commission (ACTC) travel demand model with approved and reasonably
foreseeable projects.


1.1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Project site (Assessor’s Parcel Numbers 057-2026-00405) is located within United States Census
Tract 58, on the southeast corner of the block bounded by Center Street to the north, Allston Way to
the south, Shattuck Avenue to the east, and Milvia Street to the west. The site is located within the
Downtown Area Plan (DAP) Core Area and lies within the Commercial Downtown Mixed Use (C-DMU)
zoning district. The ground floor site plan for the proposed Project is shown in Figure 2. The Project site
plans are also included as Appendix B.

Introduction


As currently proposed, the Project includes demolition of the existing twostory commercial/retail
building (currently occupied by Walgreens Pharmacy) and construction of an 18story building with a
totalof274residentialdwellingunitsand10,000squarefeetofgroundfloorcommercial/retailspace.
It is anticipated that the current commercial tenant, Walgreens, would move back to the site after
construction.Ofthe274units,therewouldbe57microunits,63studiounits,93onebedroomunits,
and61twobedroomunits.Abelowgradeparkinggaragewith103vehicleparkingspaces,includingsix
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible parking spaces, and five car share spaces, would be
accessiblefromtheexistingcurbcutanddrivewayonAllstonWay.Abicycleparkingfacilitywithspaces
for 94 bicycles and a repair shop would be located on the west side of the building, accessible from
Allston Way, and shortterm bicycle parking for six bicycles serving the commercial space would be
locatedinbikeracksplacednearthepedestrianentrancestothestore.

TheproposedProjectwouldcoordinatewithimprovementstotheBARTPlazaonShattuckAvenuethat
willenhancethepublicrealmwithpaving,benches,trees,andbikeracks.Streetimprovementsonthe
southsideoftheProjectsiteincludeanentryplazaandAllstonArtWalkatthebaseoftheresidential
tower.  These public spaces would provide a circulating space near the lobby to the residential and
community art space.  To complement the transitoriented nature of the Project site, transit passes
wouldbeprovidedtoemployeesandfivecarsharespaceswouldbeprovidedonsite.


1.1.1. VehicularAccess
AsshowninFigure2,residentsdrivingtothesitewouldaccesstheproposed103spacebelowgrade
parking garage through the existing 22foot wide curb cut and driveway that currently serves
delivery/service vehicles to Walgreens.  This driveway to the underground residential garage would
accommodatetwotravellanes,oneentryandoneexitlane.

Commercial parking for the retail space would not be required per City of Berkeley Municipal Code.
The Project does not propose to provide any vehicle parking spaces for the commercial use.  People
driving to the commercial space would be anticipated to park in nearby onstreet parking spaces or
publicgarages,suchastheCenterStreetGarage.


1.1.2. PedestrianAccess
PrimarypedestrianaccesstotheresidentialunitswouldbefromtheresidentiallobbyonAllstonWay,
or through the proposed elevators located within the garage.  Pedestrian access to the commercial
retailspacewouldbefromShattuckAvenue,similartotheexistingaccesstoWalgreensstore,whichis
currently operating at the site.  The proposed Project is within convenient walking distance of major
employmentandretaildestinations,andmanyotheramenities,suchasparksandrestaurants.1

Introduction


The proposed Project would implement public realm improvements along Allston Way and Shattuck
Avenue that would be coordinated and consistent with ongoing plans and projects for Downtown
Berkeley, including the Streets and Open Space Improvement Plan (SOSIP) and Shattuck Avenue
Reconfiguration.


1.1.3. BicycleAccess
The proposed Project is within convenient biking distance of many popular destinations.2  Existing
bicycle facilities near the project site include a Class 4 cycle track on Fulton Street, and Class 2 bike
lanesonCenterStreet,MilviaStreet,OxfordStreet,andHearstAvenue.Designatedbicycleboulevards
neartheprojectsiteincludeMilviaStreetandChanningWay.

AlthoughtheProjectisnotrequiredtoprovidebicycleparkingforresidents,theProjectwouldprovide
a bicycle storage facility located adjacent to the garage on Allston Way.  The bicycle storage facility
wouldprovidelongtermaccommodationfor94bicycles.TheProjectwouldprovidesixbicyclespaces
in the public rightofway along Allston Way and would meet City of Berkeley Municipal Code
requirementsforbicycleparkingforcommercialuses.


1.1.4. LoadingAccess

CommercialLoading
TheProjectdoesnotproposetoprovideanoffstreetloadingdockormakemodificationstoexisting
onstreet loading and would not meet City of Berkeley Municipal Code requirements for offstreet
loadingspacesforcommercialuse.Thecommercialtruckloadingzone(TLZ)(yellowcurb)alongAllston
Way,eastoftheProjectdriveway,hasbeenremovedasaresultofongoingconstructionandtheintent
is to replace this space permanentlywith red curb anda buszone.  It is anticipated that commercial
loading related to the project would occur in available onstreet parking spaces or the nearest truck
loadingzone,locatedonthewestsideofHaroldWayneartheintersectionwithAllstonWay.


PassengerLoading
Thereisanexistingpassengerloading(whitecurb)zoneonthesouthsideofAllstonWay,acrossthe
streetfromtheProjectsite.Itisanticipatedthatpassengerloadingrelatedtotheprojectwouldoccur
indesignatedpassengerloading(whitecurb)spacesalongthesouthsideofAllstonWay.

Introduction


1.1.5. Garbage, Recycling, and Green Waste Collection
Garbage, recycling, and green waste (or compost) storage for the residential (apartment) and
commercial retail uses would be conducted in designated areas located within the proposed garage.
Building management would be responsible for rolling garbage, recycling, and green waste bins
curbside for collection. Consistent with current trash and recycling collection practice, trucks would
have direct access to the curbside collection area from nearby loading zones or on-street parking
spaces.


1.1.6. Emergency Vehicle Access
Emergency responders would have adequate access to the site along Shattuck Avenue and Allston Way.
The Project does not propose modifications to the roadway network or major modifications (circulation
patterns or design features) to streets adjacent to the Project site.


1.2. STUDY SCOPE AND APPROACH
The following scenarios were evaluated to identify the potential transportation impacts of the proposed
Project:
          x     Existing Conditions. Existing (Year 2016) traffic volumes and roadway conditions in the
                vicinity of the proposed Project;
          x     Baseline Conditions. Existing (Year 2016) traffic volumes and roadway conditions
                accounting for approved and reasonably foreseeable development and transportation
                network projects located in the vicinity of the proposed Project;
          x     Baseline plus Project Conditions. This scenario is identical to Baseline Conditions, but with
                the addition of traffic generated by the proposed 2190 Shattuck Avenue development;
          x     Cumulative Conditions. This scenario utilizes traffic forecasts for future year 2040
                developed using growth rates derived from the ACTC travel demand model considering
                future development with the addition of traffic generated by approved and reasonably
                foreseeable projects and considering planned improvements to the transportation and
                circulation network in the vicinity of the proposed Project; and
          x     Cumulative plus Project Conditions. This scenario is identical to Cumulative Conditions, but
                with the addition of traffic generated by the proposed 2190 Shattuck Avenue development.


1.2.1. Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Intersection level of Service (LOS) was analyzed at seven study intersections that were selected in
coordination with City staff. These study intersections represent locations where based on the trip
generation, distribution and assignment, the proposed Project has the potential to impact intersection
operations. Intersection analysis locations are listed in this section and illustrated in Figure 3.

Introduction


As shown in Figure 3, the following intersections are evaluated.

1. Martin Luther King Jr. Way/University Avenue;
2. Martin Luther King Jr. Way/Alston Way;
3. Milvia Street/Allston Way;
4. Shattuck Avenue/University Avenue;
5. Shattuck Avenue/Center Street;
6. Shattuck Avenue/Allston Way; and
7. Shattuck Avenue/Bancroft Way.
Consistent with the City of Berkeley Office of Transportation’s Guidelines for Development of Traffic
Impact Reports (Guidelines) (September, 2005) and the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans’) Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (Caltrans’ Guidelines) (December 2002),
all seven study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours. The weekday AM
and PM peak hours are defined as the peak one hour (comprised of four consecutive 15-minute
intervals) of the weekday AM and PM peak periods (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM,
respectively).3

Intersections were analyzed using PTV’s Vistro Software, which applies the Highway Capacity Manual
(2010 HCM) methodology. This methodology uses quantitative measures of traffic conditions (turning
movement volumes, signal timing information, roadway geometric configurations) to determine
capacity, average delay, and other operational performance measures at an intersection, of which the
most widely used is the level of service.4 Level of service provides a qualitative description of the
performance of an intersection based on average delay per vehicle. Intersection LOS ranges from LOS A,
which indicates free flow or excellent conditions with short delays, to LOS F, which indicates congested
or overloaded conditions with extremely long delays. LOS and delay are reported as an average across
all movements and approaches for study signalized intersections. Intersection LOS criteria are
summarized in Table 1.




3
    For purposes of the intersection level of service analysis, a system-wide peak hour was selected for each peak period.
4
    As part of the HCM methodology, adjustments are typically made to the capacity of each intersection to account for various factors that reduce
    the ability of the streets to accommodate vehicles (such as the Downtown nature of the area, number of pedestrians, vehicle types, lane widths,
    grades, on-street parking and queues). These adjustments are performed to ensure that the LOS analysis results reflect the operating conditions
    that are observed in the field.

1.2.2. Transit Assessment
Consistent with the methodologies outlined in the Guidelines, the assessment of impacts was based on
the location of bus stops, transit service, and ridership. Project-generated transit trips were estimated
and the effect of increased ridership at transit stops that serve the proposed Project site was evaluated.
Potential impacts to transit that were assessed include effects of Project-generated vehicle traffic on
transit operations and pedestrian access/egress at transit stops.


1.2.3. Pedestrian Assessment
Pedestrian conditions were qualitatively assessed on streets surrounding the Project site. Factors
considered in the assessment include sidewalk widths, compliance with ADA accessibility requirements,
current activity levels, and the number of new, Project-generated, pedestrian trips that would be added
to the network. The adequacy of pedestrian connections to nearby transit routes was assessed and
potential pedestrian safety concerns were identified, including conflicts between vehicular traffic and
pedestrian circulation. Impacts to pedestrian conditions as a result of Project-generated activities were
qualitatively assessed in accordance with the Berkeley Pedestrian Master Plan (adopted June 22, 2010).
Potential impacts of the proposed Project to pedestrians in Alameda Countywide Pedestrian Plan –
Pedestrian Plan Areas of Countywide Significance (adopted October 2012) were also addressed.


1.2.4. Bicycle Assessment
Bicycle conditions throughout the study area were qualitatively assessed as they relate to the proposed
Project study area—including safety and right-of-way issues—and existing and potential new bicycle
facilities were identified. Impacts to bicycle conditions as a result of Project-generated activities,
including Project-generated traffic and driveway movements, were qualitatively assessed in accordance
with the Berkeley Bicycle Plan 2016 Update (public draft released October 2016). Potential impacts of



                                                                      10                 Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

the proposed Project to bicyclists on the Alameda Countywide Bicycle Network and Countywide
facilities were also addressed.


1.2.5. Loading Assessment
Existing loading conditions and activity was examined on streets surrounding the Project site. Loading
conditions and restrictions were identified and the Project’s proposed supply of loading spaces was
compared against City of Berkeley Municipal Code requirements. The impacts of the proposed Project’s
loading activities—including location, design, and control—on traffic, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle
conditions were also qualitatively assessed.


1.2.6. Emergency Vehicle Access Assessment
Emergency vehicle access to and from the proposed Project site was qualitatively assessed for
adequacy.


1.2.7. Non-CEQA Analysis


Parking Assessment
The Project’s proposed supply of parking was compared against City of Berkeley Municipal Code
requirements. The impacts of Project-related parking activities—including location, design, and
control—on traffic, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle conditions were also qualitatively assessed.


Vehicle Miles Traveled Analysis
The average vehicle trip length was obtained from the ACTC travel demand model for the Project’s
transportation analysis zone (TAZ) 58. This average vehicle trip length was then multiplied by the
vehicle trip generation estimates to estimate daily, weekday AM, and weekday PM vehicle miles
traveled (VMT). The VMT attributable to the proposed Project is included for informational purposes.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter provides a description of the regulatory framework, existing roadway, transit, pedestrian,
and bikeway networks and documentation of the existing traffic, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, parking
and loading, and emergency vehicle access conditions in the study area. The summary utilizes new data
including traffic counts and field observations conducted in October 2016 and information included in
the City of Berkeley General Plan Land Use and Transportation Elements, the Downtown Area Plan, and
recently completed environmental documents (i.e., 2211 Harold Way EIR and 2129 Shattuck Avenue
EIR).


2.1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

2.1.1. Regional Regulations


Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC)
The Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC) coordinates transportation planning efforts
throughout Alameda County and programs federal, state, regional, and local funding for project
planning and implementation. Through its Congestion Management Program (CMP), ACTC oversees and
monitors the operations and performance of roadways in the CMP network, which consist of freeways
and major arterials that provide connectivity in the County. The Land Use Analysis Program of the CMP
requires local jurisdictions to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed land use changes (i.e., General
Plan amendments, and developments estimated to generate 100 or more net new PM peak hour
automobile trips) on the CMP network.

Based on the expected trip generation potential of the proposed Project (i.e., less than 100 peak hour
vehicle trips), an ACTC CMP analysis of the proposed Project’s effect on CMP and Metropolitan Transit
System (MTS) roadways is not required per the CMP Land Use Analysis Program.


2.1.2. Local Regulations

City of Berkeley General Plan (2003)
The Transportation Element of the Berkeley General Plan (2003) contains the following policies and
actions relevant to the proposed Project.

Policy T-4: Transit First Policy. Give priority to alternative transportation and transit over single-
occupant vehicles on Transit Routes identified on the Transit Network map.

Policy T-6: Transportation Services Fee. Ensure that new development does not impact existing
transportation services and facilities (see Policy LU-28).

Existing Conditions


Policy T-10: Trip Reduction. To reduce automobile traffic and congestion and increase transit use and
alternative modes in Berkeley, support, and when appropriate require, programs to encourage Berkeley
citizens and commuters to reduce automobile trips, such as:

     x    Participation in a citywide Eco-Pass Program (see Policy T-3);
     x    Participation in the Commuter Check Program;
     x    Carpooling and provision of carpool parking and other necessary facilities;
     x    Telecommuting programs;
     x    Free bicycle programs and electric bicycle programs;
     x    Car-sharing programs;
     x    Use of pedal-cab, bicycle delivery services, and other delivery services;
     x    Programs to encourage neighborhood-level initiatives to reduce traffic by encouraging residents
          to combine trips, carpool, telecommute, reduce the number of cars owned, shop locally, and
          use alternative modes;
     x    Programs to reward Berkeley citizens and neighborhoods that can document reduced car use;
     x    Limitations on the supply of long-term commuter parking and elimination of subsidies for
          commuter parking; and,
     x    No-fare shopper shuttles connecting all shopping districts throughout the city.
Policy T-12: Education and Enforcement. Support, and when possible require, education and
enforcement programs to encourage carpooling and alternatives to single-occupant automobile use,
reduce speeding, and increase pedestrian, bicyclist, and automobile safety.
     x    Action B. Encourage hotels, motels, and other visitor destinations to provide visitors with
          information on public transportation and bicycle services and facilities
Policy T-14: Private Employers. Encourage private employers to reduce the demand for automobile
travel through transportation demand management programs that include elements such as:

     x    Trip reduction incentives such as Commuter Check and Eco-Pass;
     x    Flexible work hours and telecommuting to reduce peak-hour commute congestion;
     x    Carpool and vanpool incentives to reduce single-occupancy vehicle use;
     x    Provision of mass transit pass/credit instead of free employee parking (parking "cash-out"
          programs);
     x    Providing bicycle facilities;
     x    Market pricing mechanisms for employee parking to reduce automotive use and discourage all-
          day parking;
     x    Local hiring policies; and,
     x    Numerical goals for trip reduction

Existing Conditions


Policy T-15: Local Hiring. Establish Berkeley residency as a preference for hiring, and encourage other
public employers, institutions, and private employers to hire locally (see Policy ED-1).

Policy T-18: Level of Service. When considering transportation impacts under the California
Environmental Quality Act, the City shall consider how a plan or project affects all modes of
transportation, including transit riders, bicyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, to determine the
transportation impacts of a plan or project. Significant beneficial pedestrian, bicycle, or transit impacts,
or significant beneficial impacts on air quality, noise, visual quality, or safety in residential areas, may
offset or mitigate a significant adverse impact on vehicle LOS to a level of insignificance. The number of
transit riders, pedestrians, and bicyclists potentially affected will be considered when evaluating a
degradation of LOS for motorists.

Policy T-19: Air Quality Impacts. Continue to encourage innovative technologies and programs such as
clean-fuel, electric, and low-emission cars that reduce the air quality impacts of the automobile (see
Policies EM-18 through EM-22).

     x    Action A. Establish bicycle and low-emission vehicle preferred parking areas; and,
     x    Action B. Install electric vehicle charging stations in all City-owned parking facilities downtown
          and at major parking facilities and employment centers.
Policy T-32: Shared Parking. Encourage Berkeley businesses and institutions to establish shared parking
agreements, which would make the most efficient use of existing and new parking areas (see Policy ED-
6).

Policy T-33: Disabled Parking and Passenger Zones. Ensure adequate disabled parking and passenger
drop-off zones.

     x    Action A. Require access to adequate disabled parking and passenger drop-off zones in all new
          commercial and residential developments.
Policy T-34: Downtown and Southside Parking Management. Manage the supply of Downtown and
Southside public parking to discourage long-term all-day parking and increase the availability and
visibility of short-term parking for local businesses (see Policy ED-6).

     x    Action B. Improve signage and access to existing public parking, including UC lots open to the
          public, in the Downtown and in the Southside;
     x    Action C. Increase all-day parking rates, maintain lower parking rates for short-term parking,
          eliminate monthly parking passes, provide "cash-out" programs, and extend hours of operation
          in City garages;
     x    Action D. Improve lighting and security in Downtown garages to encourage better utilization
          during off-peak hours; and,
     x    Action F. Limit employee parking based on need for a vehicle on the job, number of passengers

Policy T-35: Public Parking Supply in the Downtown and Southside. Prioritize implementation of
improved parking conditions in the Downtown and Southside through better utilization of existing
parking and through implementation of policies to reduce demand for parking. Allow enough time for
these improvements to be in place to demonstrate their effectiveness before considering public
expenditures on construction of additional City-owned public parking spaces in the area.

     x    Action A. Reduce demand for parking by implementing specific actions in the Southside/
          Downtown Transportation Demand Management Study (see Tier One, Tier Two, and Tier Three
          programs and actions in the TDM Study) particularly taking actions to improve transit services
          and implementing an Eco-Pass program (see Policy T-3), and implementing commuter, shopper,
          and visitor shuttles (see Policy T-2); and,
     x    Action B. Increase availability of existing parking, including UC parking, to shoppers, visitors, and
          other short-term users (see Policy T-34).
Policy T-39: High-Tech Parking. To make the most efficient use of available land, encourage
consideration of high-tech computerized parking (e.g., lifts and or "robotics") when replacing existing
public parking or when providing off-street parking for multi-family residential projects.

Policy T-40: Parking Impacts. When considering parking impacts under the California Environmental
Quality Act for residential projects with more than two units located in the Avenue Commercial,
Downtown, or High Density Residential land use classifications, any significant parking impacts
identified that result from the project should be mitigated by improving alternatives to automobile
travel and thereby reducing the need for parking. Examples include improvements to public
transportation, pedestrian access, car sharing programs, and bicycle facility improvements. Parking
impacts for these projects should not be mitigated through the provision of additional parking on the
site. The City finds that:

     x    Action C. Ensure that sidewalks are kept in good repair and are level, with a suitable grade for
          pedestrians and wheelchairs. Discourage, and when possible prevent, new developments from
          creating uncomfortably steep grades; and,
     x    Action D. Ensure adequate unobstructed sidewalk passage by appropriate placement of street
          furniture and amenities and prevention of obstruction of travel ways by such items as
          advertisement signs, merchandise, and utility boxes.
Policy T-51: Pedestrian Priority. When addressing competing demands for sidewalk space, the needs of
the pedestrian shall be the highest priority.


City of Berkeley Downtown Area Plan (2012)
The Access Element of the Berkeley Downtown Area Plan (2012) contains the following policies and
actions relevant to the proposed Project.

Goal AC-1: Improve options that increase access to downtown on foot, by bicycle, and via transit.
Make living, working, and visiting downtown as car-free as possible.


                                                         16                                Kittelson & Associates, Inc.
Transportation Impact Analysis                                                                              January 2017
Existing Conditions


     x    Policy AC-1.1: Street Modifications. Modify Downtown’s streets and street network to better
          serve the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit (see policies under Goal OS-1). While
          recognizing that automobiles will be an important transportation mode for the foreseeable
          future, reduce and avoid negative impacts from the private automobile on pedestrians, transit,
          and bicycles (see policies under Goals AC-2, AC-4 and AC-5). Development projects that are
          adjacent to designated street improvements should finance a fair-share of these improvements
          as condition of project approval.
                  c) Implement street improvements that benefit pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit.
                  Reallocate parts of public rights-of-way that give unneeded capacity to motor vehicles and
                  can be repurposed to yield pedestrian, bicycle, and/or ecological benefits. Travel lanes
                  should not be eliminated until analysis has determined that safety, transit, and traffic
                  operations can be adequately addressed, however the DAP EIR has indicated that traffic
                  lane reductions appear to be feasible in the following locations:

                                Shattuck Avenue and Shattuck Square between University Avenue and Allston;
                                University Avenue between Shattuck Square and Oxford;
                                Hearst Avenue between Shattuck and Oxford; and,
                                Closing Center Street to regular traffic between Shattuck and Oxford.
                  d) Adopt a Downtown Streets & Open Space Improvement Plan that establishes policies
                  and actions relating to street improvements that can occur throughout the Downtown
                  Area (such as sidewalk bulb-outs, suitable travel lane widths, bicycle parking, street trees,
                  street lighting, furnishings, etc.), as well as major projects (including Center Street Plaza,
                  Center Street Greenway and Civic Center Park, Shattuck Square, University Avenue
                  Gateway, Shattuck Avenue, and Hearst Street) (see Policy OS-1.1).

                  f) Once the design of improvements is conceptually approved, private and public
                  developers adjacent to designed improvements should implement them as part of the
                  development project, whenever feasible and as described in Policies (see Policies LU-2
                  and OS-3).

                  g) Engage merchants, property owners, transit agencies, the University and other
                  stakeholders to emphasize Downtown as a shared destination. Work with AC Transit and
                  other transit agencies to evaluate the impact of proposed street and street network
                  changes on transit vehicle operations, and to identify suitable bus stop and layover
                  locations (such as to replace those displaced by a new Center Street Plaza). Bus stops and
                  layover locations should not degrade transit service, and should not negatively impact
                  pedestrian environments.

     x    Policy AC-1.2: Single-Occupant Vehicles. Discourage the use of single-occupant vehicles (SOVs)
          by commuters to Downtown and encourage commuting with transit, ridesharing, bicycles, and
          on foot.



                                                              17                               Kittelson & Associates, Inc.
Transportation Impact Analysis                                                                        January 2017
Existing Conditions


                  a) Require larger development projects to provide ridesharing parking and support their
                  on-going operations. Strive to serve subareas where ridesharing locations are not
                  convenient by identifying potential ridesharing locations and working with ridesharing
                  providers.

     x    Policy AC-1.3: Alternative Modes & Transportation Demand Management (TDM). New
          development and on-going programs should reduce Downtown car use, support alternative
          travel modes, and consolidate publicly-accessible parking facilities and Transportation Demand
          Management (TDM) programs (see Policy LU-2.1).
                  a) A fee requirement should be established to support alternative modes (i.e. transit,
                  walking & bicycling) and Transportation Demand Management programs. Parking
                  requirements for new development may be reduced by paying an in lieu fee into a fund to
                  enhance transit, which might be contained within the Streets and Open Space
                  Improvement Plan (SOSIP); in lieu payments for parking should be encouraged; and,

                  d) Require that new buildings and substantial additions support alternative transportation
                  as identified in Policy LU-2.1c. The City should help small businesses and smaller
                  development projects qualify for discounted transit passes, such as by working directly
                  with AC Transit or by encouraging the formation of an association assigned with this
                  mission.

Goal AC-2: Give pedestrians priority in downtown, and make walking downtown safe, attractive, easy
and convenient for people of all ages and abilities.

     x    Policy AC-2.1: Pedestrian Safety and Amenities. Improve the safety, attractiveness and
          convenience of pedestrian routes within Downtown – and to and from surrounding areas.
          Encourage a wide range of pedestrian amenities to meet the needs and interests of those who
          live and work in and near Downtown (see policies under Goal HD-4).
                  a) Adopt a Streets and Open Space Improvement Plan with policies and implementing
                  actions, including provisions for adequate sidewalk width, shortening pedestrian crossing
                  distances at intersections, and new mid-block pedestrian crosswalks where justified by
                  high volumes of pedestrians and a long distance between intersections;

                  b) To reduce pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, minimize driveway curb cuts to the extent
                  feasible, and where they must occur: avoid making driveways too wide or creating uneven
                  surfaces where driveways cross sidewalks; and,

                  c) Maintain sidewalks, crosswalks, plazas, and other pedestrian environments so that they
                  are safe, clean and in good repair.

     x    Policy AC-2.2: Universal Access. Provide safe access to all Downtown streets and pathways for
          people of all abilities.
                  a) Use regulation and incentives to require and/or encourage universal accessibility up-
                  grades for private businesses when significant modifications to structures are made.

                                                         18                              Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

Goal AC-3: Provide parking to meet the needs of Downtown, while discouraging commuter parking
and encouraging motorists to park their cars and experience Downtown as a pedestrian.

     x    Policy AC-3.2: New Parking. Provide sufficient parking for expected growth by evaluating future
          parking needs, funding parking facilities, and promoting alternatives to the car. In addition,
          replace on-street parking lost to street and other improvements within off-street garages.
          Consolidate parking in shared facilities to the extent possible
                  d) Prohibit new driveways on Shattuck and University Avenues in Downtown except when
                  it can be demonstrated that no other site-access options exist or where other alternatives
                  would have greater negative impacts; and,

                  g) New development should provide effective parking and TDM measures (see Policies LU-
                  2.1 and AC-1.3).

     x    Policy AC-3.3: Pedestrian Impacts. Locate and design new parking in ways that minimize
          negative impacts upon the pedestrian quality of Downtown (see Policy HD-4.1).
                  a) With new development, discourage parking on-site to increase space available for
                  street-level retail and activity;

                  b) Minimize driveway curb cuts to make Down-town more safe and attractive for
                  pedestrians. Locate, design, and size entrances and exits to parking to minimize impact on
                  the pedestrian realm, such as through traffic management, exit mirrors, and warning
                  lights; and,

                  d) Discourage use of more than 25 percent of a building’s street-level area for parking.
                  Place parking below grade when feasible. When below-grade parking is deemed
                  infeasible, above-grade parking structures should face streets and public open spaces in
                  ways that support pedestrian safety and activity. Surface parking should be prohibited
                  along streets.

Goal AC-4: Promote transit as an efficient, attractive choice and as a primary mode of motor-vehicle
travel.

     x    Policy AC-4.1: Transit Priority. Promote transit as the primary mode for commuting to and from
          Downtown, and give transit priority over personal vehicles. Encourage use of transit by area
          businesses, institutions, and residents.
                  a) Require that new development provides bus passes and promotes use of alternative
                  modes (see Policies LU-2.1 and AC-1.3);

                  b) Work collaboratively with Downtown employers, institutions, and organizations
                  (including major employers such as the City of Berkeley, UC Berkeley, Berkeley Unified
                  School District, Berkeley City College, Berkeley Unified School District, Lawrence Berkeley
                  National Laboratory, and Alta Bates Medical Center) to adopt aggressive TDM programs
                  and facilities that reduce automobile use by staff, faculty and students; and,

                                                         19                               Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

                  c) Require that Downtown businesses provide bus passes to employees and pre-tax com-
                  mute-by-transit vouchers. Work with businesses and institutions to expand guaranteed-
                  ride-home programs for employees who use transit. Encourage Downtown employers to
                  provide other subsidies for bicycling, walking and public transit use. Encourage Berkeley
                  Unified School District and Peralta Community College to participate in such programs or
                  to establish their own programs to reduce automobile use by faculty and staff.

     x    Policy AC-4.2: Attractive Transit. Make transit an efficient and attractive choice by improving
          speed, reliability, pedestrian safety, and comfort. Improve transit options and give transit
          priority over personal vehicles.
                  c) Work with AC Transit and shuttle providers to identify suitable bus stops and layover
                  locations. Consider the integration of bus facilities within City, University, and/or private
                  projects; and,

                  d) Avoid bus stop and layover locations that interrupt pedestrian movement or block clear
                  views of sidewalks, plazas or storefronts. Give careful consideration to trade-offs between
                  facilitating bus turning movements and other operations versus reductions in on-street
                  parking supply, landscaping, and sidewalks.

Goal AC-5: Maintain and enhance safe, attractive and convenient bicycle circulation within
Downtown, and to and from surrounding areas, for people of all ages and abilities. Promote bicycling
Downtown.

     x    Policy AC-5.2: Bicycle Parking. Increase the availability of convenient, secure and at-tractive
          short- and long-term bicycle parking throughout Downtown.
                  a) Increase the availability of secured bicycle parking throughout Downtown, particularly
                  in areas of high use, including bicycle parking options that are sheltered and/or attended;

                  b) Increase availability of bicycle racks throughout Downtown, especially where parking
                  meter poles are removed; and,

                  e) Require the provision of secure bicycle parking facilities by new development projects
                  (and major renovations), both public and private.

     x    Policy AC-5.3: Bike Sharing. Promote convenient “bike sharing” options (i.e., short-term bike
          rentals) and their use by employees, residents, and visitors – especially near BART.


2.2. ROADWAY NETWORK

Existing Conditions



2.4. TRANSIT NETWORK
Local, Rapid, and Transbay fixed-route bus and shuttle service is provided by Alameda-Contra Costa
County Transit (AC Transit). Regional commuter rail service is provided by Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART). Other regional transit service, such as Amtrak Capitol Corridor passenger rail, is accessible by
transferring to and from AC Transit. Figure 5 illustrates the transit service near the site.


2.4.1. AC Transit
The nearest AC Transit bus stops are located at the corner of Allston Way and Shattuck Avenue. Other
nearby stops are located along Shattuck Avenue, Center Street, and University Avenue. Existing transit
routes that serve the Project site are summarized in Table 3.

Observations of transit service and ridership indicate that transit activity is concentrated along the
Shattuck Avenue and University Avenue corridors with heavy transfer activity from BART to AC Transit
during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. The Project frontage along Allston Way is currently striped
with red curb and is utilized as a bus layover zone and posted bus stop for AC Transit Line 12 and Line
88. This layover zone was observed to be utilized periodically throughout the day by one or more AC
Transit vehicles.


2.4.2. Bay Area Rapid Transit
BART is the regional rapid transit provider and connects Berkeley to other parts of Alameda County,
Contra Costa County, San Francisco, and northern San Mateo County. The BART system operates trains
along five routes: (1) Richmond-Fremont; (2) Richmond-Daly City/SFO/Millbrae; (3) San Francisco
Airport (SFO)/Millbrae-Dublin/Pleasanton; (4) SFO/Millbrae-Pittsburg/Bay Point; and (5) Fremont-Daly
City. The BART lines that serve the North Berkeley and Downtown Berkeley BART Stations, nearest the
Project site, include the Richmond-Fremont, and Richmond-Daly City/SFO/Millbrae lines. The Project
site is located adjacent to the Downtown Berkeley BART Station, which has station entrances on the
west side of Shattuck Avenue at Allston Way and Center Street.

The characteristics of BART lines serving the Berkeley Station are summarized in Table 4. The number
of passengers entering and exiting the Downtown Berkeley BART Station during the weekday, Saturday,
and Sunday are summarized in Table 5.

2.5. PEDESTRIAN CONDITIONS

2.5.1. Pedestrian Facilities
The Project site lies within a Central Business District and Pedestrian Plan Area of Countywide
Significance in the Alameda Countywide Pedestrian Plan. Several major employment centers and
cultural/entertainment venues are located nearby. Sidewalks about eight feet in width are provided on
both sides of Allston Way and sidewalk width (including bulbouts) range from forty to sixty feet on
Shattuck Avenue (east), at the BART station entrance adjacent to the Project site. Sidewalks elsewhere
on Shattuck Avenue are between 12 and 15 feet in width. The presence of signal poles, parking meters,
street trees, and bicycle racks reduce the effective sidewalk width on Allston Way to about five feet at
some locations.

Marked crosswalks and other pedestrian infrastructure (curb ramps, pedestrian signals), are provided
at all legs of each study intersection. High-visibility crosswalk markings are provided at Shattuck
Avenue/University Avenue, Milvia Street/University Avenue, and Milvia Street/Center Street. A
concrete median pedestrian refuge island is provided along Shattuck Avenue.


2.5.2. Pedestrian Activity
Generally moderate to high levels of pedestrian activity were observed on blocks adjacent the Project
site with activity concentrated along Shattuck Avenue near the Berkeley BART station entrances.
Periods of peak pedestrian activity coincided with the peak commute periods for school and work,
while short peaks of pedestrian activity occurred during BART train arrivals. Many pedestrians were
observed traveling to/from Berkeley High School and UC Berkeley campus, located two blocks to the
west and east, respectively. Pedestrian counts are included in Appendix C.

During the weekday AM peak hour, more than 1,500 pedestrians were observed crossing at Shattuck
Avenue/Allston Way and about 1,700 pedestrians were observed crossing at Milvia Street/Allston Way.
During the weekday PM peak hour, more than 2,100 pedestrians were observed crossing at Shattuck
Avenue/Allston Way and about 2,300 pedestrians were observed crossing at Shattuck Avenue/Center
Street.


2.6. BICYCLE CONDITIONS

2.6.1. Bicycle Facility Classifications
Caltrans designated four classes of bicycle facilities: Classes I, II, III, and IV. In addition, ACTC has
adopted a set of sub-classifications for each Caltrans’ classification. City of Berkeley has adopted these
classifications and sub-classifications, as follows:




                                                     29                                Kittelson & Associates, Inc.
Transportation Impact Analysis                                                                         January 2017
Existing Conditions


Class I Multi-Use Path – Class I bikeways are multi-use or shared paths that provide a dedicated path
for bicyclists and pedestrians and do not permit motorized travel. Multi-use paths create a relaxed
environment for non-motorized travel and reduce the risk of potential conflict between vehicles and
bicyclists. These facilities are typically located in parks or greenway areas, areas connecting dead-end
streets, or atop railroad right-of-way that is no longer in use. Sub-classifications include IA Paved Paths
and IIA Unpaved Paths.

Class II Bicycle Lane – Class II bicycle lanes are the portion of the roadway network that has been
striped and signed for bicycle use. Bicycle lanes are typically used along collector or major streets with
medium to high traffic volumes, providing additional travel space for bicyclists along busy roadway
segments. Sub-classifications include:

     x    Class IIA – Conventional bicycle lane;
     x    Class IIB – Upgraded bicycle lane 1) striped bicycle lane with striped buffer between bicycle lane
          and traffic lane; and, 2) bicycle lane with green conflict markings;
     x    Class IIC – Climbing bicycle lane, a bicycle lane in the uphill direction and a bicycle route in the
          downhill direction; and,
     x    Class IID – Contraflow bicycle lane, a striped bicycle lane that allows travel in the opposite
          direction of vehicle traffic. Primarily used on one-way streets.
Class III Bicycle Route – Class III bicycle routes are signed routes where bicyclists share the mixed-flow
travel lane with vehicles. These shared facilities are only appropriate on low-volume streets with slow
travel speeds. Sub-classifications include:

     x    Class IIIA – Signage-only routes;
     x    Class IIIB – Wide curb lane or shoulder, may include signage;
     x    Class IIIC – Route with standard shared lane markings (sharrows) or other pavement stenciling
          (may also include signage);
     x    Class IIID – Route with green-backed sharrows, also referred to as “super sharrows”; and,
     x    Class IIIE – Bicycle Boulevards (signed, shared travelways with low motor vehicle volumes and
          low speed limits that prioritize bicycle travel through traffic calming strategies, wayfinding
          signage, and traffic control).
Class IV Separated Bikeway – Class IV separated bikeways, also known as a cycle track, is an on-street
bicycle lane that is physically separated from motor vehicle traffic by a vertical element or barrier, such
as a curb, bollards, or parking aisle. Sub-classifications include:
     x    Class IVA – One-way cycle track/protected bikeway
     x    Class IVB – Two-way cycle track/protected bikeway

Existing Conditions


Milvia Street is a north-south Class IIIE Bicycle Boulevard that extends from Hopkins Street in the north
to Russell Street in the south. Traffic calming treatments such as speed humps and bulbouts are present
on the section between Cedar Street and University Avenue. Class IIA Bicycle Lanes are striped on
Milvia Street from Allston Way to Channing Way.

Walnut Street is a north-south Class IIIA Signage-only Bicycle Route that extends from Rose Street in
the north to Hearst Avenue in the south.

Oxford-Fulton Street provides north-south Class II Bicycle Lanes from Hearst Avenue in the north to
Bancroft Way in the south and is a Class IVA Separated Bikeway from Bancroft Way in the north to
Channing Way in the south.

Virginia Street is an east-west Class III Bicycle Route that extends from Euclid Street in the east to Fifth
Street in the west. This bikeway provides a connection to the University Avenue Pedestrian Bridge and
the Berkeley Marina Overpass via Fifth Street, Hearst Avenue, Fourth Street, Addison Street, and
Aquatic Park.

Hearst Avenue provides east-west Class II Bicycle Lanes from Shattuck Avenue in the east to California
Street in the west, where it connects to the Ohlone Greenway and California Street Bicycle Boulevard.

Center Street provides east-west Class II Bicycle Lanes from Milvia Street to Shattuck Avenue.

Channing Way provides east-west Class II Bicycle Lanes between Piedmont Avenue in the east to
Martin Luther King Jr Way in the west and is a Class IIIB Bicycle Route west of Martin Luther King Jr
Way.


2.6.3. Bicycle Activity
Generally low to moderate levels of bicycle activity were observed on streets in the vicinity of the
Project site. Bicycle activity was concentrated on designated bike routes, such as Milvia Street. The
highest level of bicycle activity occurred during the weekday AM peak hour at Milvia Street/Allston
Way, with 42 bicycle crossings at this location. Bicycle counts are included in Appendix C.


     2.1.            PARKING CONDITIONS
The Project site is located adjacent to the Shattuck Avenue commercial corridor. There are several
private parking facilities nearby, mostly serving employees and business customers. There is one city-
owned/public off-street parking facility near the Project site (Center Street Parking Garage). These
parking facilities provide a combination of reserved parking available at daily, monthly, or hourly rates.
On-street parking consists of time-limited metered spaces located along both sides of most streets in
the vicinity.

The City of Berkeley uses parking meters to manage parking demand, particularly in commercial areas
where parking availability and turnover facilitate customer access and convenience. The goBerkeley

parking program regularly monitors parking conditions in the program areas of Elmwood,
Southside/Telegraph, and Downtown Berkeley to ensure a majority of block faces (i.e., one side of one
block) in these areas maintain parking occupancies between 65 and 85 percent. The goBerkeley
parking program also manages public on-street and off-street (garage) resources, keeping hourly prices
lower at off-street facilities to incentivize parking at these locations.

Based on observations conducted during the weekday AM and PM peak periods in October and
November, on- and off-street parking, parking is fairly well-utilized within the study area. However,
parking spaces were observed to be generally available throughout the day and overnight, within a two-
block radius of the Project site.


     2.2.            LOADING CONDITIONS

2.2.1. Commercial Loading
The nearest on-street commercial loading (yellow curb) zone is located on the north side of Allston
Way, immediately east of the existing curb cut on the Project frontage.

Delivery vehicles serving nearby businesses were observed to utilize this dedicated space to complete
loading/unloading activities. If the space was occupied, nearby on-street parking spaces were generally
available for use by delivery vehicles. Double parking was not observed along Allston Street and loading
operations did not cause congestion or adversely affect traffic, transit, bicycles, or pedestrians.


2.2.2. Passenger Loading
The nearest on-street passenger loading (white curb) zone is located on the south side of Allston Way,
in front of the Shattuck Plaza Hotel, across the street from the Project site. This passenger loading
(white curb) zone is about 60 feet in length and can accommodate up to three vehicles. During field
observations this curb space was well utilized for pick-up and drop-off activities. People were observed
to stop illegally and wait for extended periods of time for passengers arriving on BART. Double parking
was not observed but people were seen stopping and waiting in the red curb, no stopping zone, when
the white curb space was occupied.

2.3. EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS
Emergency vehicle access to the proposed Project would be provided from Shattuck Avenue and Allston
Way. The nearest fire station (Berkeley Fire Station #2) is located at 2029 Berkeley Way, about 0.3 mile
north of the Project site. The next-nearest fire station (Berkeley Fire Department Main Station) is
located at 2100 Martin Luther King Jr Way, about 0.4 mile west of the Project site. During peak
commute times, general traffic congestion throughout the Project study area may result in some delay
to emergency vehicle response. However, due to the proximity to two fire stations, response times
would be expected to be less than five minutes.

Baseline Conditions



3. BASELINE CONDITIONS
This chapter summarizes Baseline Conditions. The traffic analysis takes into consideration approved and
under construction land use development and planned, funded, and approved changes to the
transportation (roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle) network and infrastructure near the proposed
Project site. Information provided by the City of Berkeley for the following approved and pending land
use development is reflected in the Baseline Conditions traffic analysis:

     x    Shattuck Avenue/University Avenue (Acheson Commons) Mixed Use Project;
     x    1974 University Avenue (StoneFire) Mixed Use Project;
     x    1935 Addison Street (Addison Arts Apartments) Project;
     x    1950 Addison Street Mixed Use Project;
     x    2211 Harold Way Mixed Use Project;
     x    2129 Shattuck Avenue Hotel Project;
     x    2025 Center Street (Center Street Parking Garage) Replacement Project; and,
     x    2121 Dwight Way (The Dwight Apartments) Residential Project.

The majority of the approved development is occurring to the north of the proposed Project, with the
exception of the 2211 Harold Way and the Dwight Way Apartment sites, which are located to the
south. The list of approved projects and the trip generation/distribution assumptions are included in
Appendix E.

In addition to the approved land use development, the Baseline Conditions scenario assumes the
following roadway network modifications:

     x    Shattuck Reconfiguration and Pedestrian Safety Project. The Shattuck Reconfiguration and
          Pedestrian Safety Project will reconfigure Shattuck Avenue from Allston Way three blocks north
          through the Shattuck Avenue/University Avenue intersection. The project proposes to
          reconfigure the west (southbound) leg of Shattuck into a two-way street, eliminating the “dog
          leg” movement for northbound traffic at Shattuck Avenue/University Avenue, while the east
          (northbound) leg of Shattuck would remain a one-way street intended for local traffic, buses
          and shuttles, with angled parking to off-set the loss of parking on the west leg of Shattuck
          Avenue. The project includes new traffic signals, curb modifications, median relocation from
          Center Street to Allston Way, relocated pedestrian refuge at Shattuck Avenue/Center Street,
          concrete bus pads, bus stops, and roadway striping. The project also repaves the street, repairs
          the sidewalk, upgrades curb ramps and installs new roadway and pedestrian-scale lighting.
          Construction is estimated to begin in Spring 2017 and last approximately six months.
     x    Downtown Berkeley BART Plaza and Transit Area Improvement Project. The BART Plaza
          Project will serve a signature place-making function for Downtown Berkeley and improve multi-
          modal access for residents and employees. The project will improve inter-modal connectivity
          and enhance rider safety and comfort by reconstructing existing, and installing new transit
          structures to improve the accessibility and security of BART entries. Pedestrian safety and

4. CUMULATIVE (YEAR 2040) CONDITIONS
This chapter summarizes Cumulative (Year 2040) Conditions. The future year (year 2040) traffic analysis
takes into consideration forecasted land use development and planned, funded, and approved changes
to the transportation (roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle) network and infrastructure near the
proposed Project site.

Traffic forecasts were developed using directional link-based growth rates for the weekday AM and PM
peak periods derived from the ACTC travel demand model. The ACTC travel demand model roadway
network is based on the constrained project list included in the Regional Transportation Plan, Plan Bay
Area. Projects on this list include, but are not limited to:

     x    I-80/Ashby Avenue Interchange Improvements;
     x    I-80 Express Lanes (Carquinez Bridge to Powell Street); and,
     x    I-80 Integrated Corridor Management.
Cumulative Conditions intersection traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 8. ACTC model plots and
growth rates are included in Appendix G.


4.1. TRANSPORTATION NETWORK IMPROVEMENTS
Planned roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle network and infrastructure improvements in the
vicinity of the Project site are summarized in this section.


4.1.1. Roadway Network
In addition to the roadway network modifications described in Section 3 Baseline Conditions
(Downtown Berkeley BART Plaza and Transit Area Improvement Project; Shattuck Reconfiguration and
Pedestrian Safety Project; and, Hearst Avenue Complete Streets Project) the “Project Bundles” and
projects identified in the Berkeley Strategic Transportation Plan (BeST) Plan and outlined in this section
may be funded and implemented under Cumulative Conditions.

Berkeley Strategic Transportation Plan
The Berkeley Strategic Transportation Plan consolidates transportation-related goals, policies, and
projects from adopted plans and City Council referrals to develop a list of capital improvements.
Individual transportation projects and programs have been grouped into “Project Bundles” based on
location and similar goals: Complete Streets Corridors; Multimodal Enhancement Areas; and, Signature
Projects and Citywide Programs. The BeST Plan Project Bundles that were submitted to ACTC 2016
Countywide Transportation Plan in the vicinity of the Project site include:

       x    Bike Boulevard Intersections;
       x    Downtown Berkeley – Milvia Bike Boulevard;
       x    Southside Area Improvements – Southside Complete Streets;
       x    Telegraph Avenue Corridor;
       x    Dwight Way Corridor;
       x    Signal Interconnect;
       x    High Priority Pedestrian Plan Projects;
       x    University Avenue Corridor;
       x    Shattuck Avenue Corridor; and,
       x    Channing Bike Boulevard.


4.1.2. Transit Network

AC Transit
AC Transit service expansion and improvements within the Albany/Berkeley/Emeryville geographic sub-
area consist of increasing frequency, establishing a network of crosstown routes, reconfiguring loop
routes in Berkeley to straight routes, simplifying the route structure, and matching service with existing
commercial and residential markets and future development growth in Downtown Berkeley. Specific
changes affecting service within the study area are outlined below. A complete summary of
improvements is provided in the AC Transit’s 2015 Service Expansion Plan (October 2015).6

       x    Line 12. Split route in Temescal. Create new lines L23 MLK/Solano and L20 Shattuck/Grand. Line
            L23 would provide direct service on 15-minute headways from Downtown Oakland to
            Downtown Berkeley via Martin Luther King Jr Way, continuing via Shattuck Avenue to North
            Berkeley and Solano. Line L20 would provide service on 20-minute headways from Jack London
            Square to Grand Lake via Broadway and Grand Avenue, continuing via Piedmont Avenue and
            Shattuck Avenue to Downtown Berkeley and Gilman district via Hopkins Street and Gilman
            Street.

     x    Line 18. Split route in Temescal and Downtown Oakland. Create new lines L23 MLK/Solano, L20
          Shattuck/Grand, and L16 Oakland/Park. Lines L20 and L23 are described under Line 12
          modifications. Line L16 would connect Oakland Avenue/Harrison Avenue segment with Park
          Boulevard segment of existing Line 18.
     x    Line 51B. Create new Line 51B College-University and improve reliability and legibility of the
          route by removing alternating Line 51B service to the Berkeley Marina. Service to Berkeley
          Marina would be replaced by Line L21 Ashby.
     x    Line 52. Create new Line 52 Cedar-University. Increase frequency from 15 to 30 minutes to
          every 15 minutes in the peak period and from 30 minutes to every 20 minutes in the off-peak.
     x    Line 67. Create new Line L25 Spruce and adjust route to serve Euclid Street between Hearst
          Avenue and Eunice Street.
     x    Line 88. Increase peak frequency to 15-minutes.
     x    Line F. Create new Line F Alcatraz. Reroute to approach Emeryville from the north via Shattuck
          Avenue, Adeline Street, 65th Street, and Hollis Street. Increase frequency to 20 minutes.
Implementation of these transit network enhancements would improve reliability and legibility of
routes, which may increase transit ridership and increase potential for higher transit mode share for
residents and visitors of the proposed Project.


BART
There are several current and ongoing projects that will improve BART service and station access.

     x    Downtown Berkeley Station Modernization. The Downtown Berkeley Station Modernization
          Project aims to create a community-based vision for modernizing the station. The project will
          identify and prioritize long-term improvements to guide future investment in the station,
          including fixing and upgrading core existing station and system facilities to keep the station
          functioning well, as well as other proposed upgrades to improve station circulation, access and
          customer experience. This project is separate from, but complementary to, the Downtown
          Berkeley Plaza and Transit Area Improvements Project.
     x    Train Control Modernization Program. Modernizing BART’s train control system will allow
          trains to operate more frequently and address critical capacity, reliability, and safety needs.
          The train control system includes both hardware and software that monitors train location and
          manages train movement. A Communication-Based Train Control system will decrease runtime
          of trains between stations and allow trains to run closer together and result in up to 25 percent
          increase in train capacity. BART is targeting mid-2018 to award the contract and estimates
          another eight years to design and install the system. The project is anticipated to be complete
          and operational in late 2023.
     x    Fleet of the Future. BART has a goal to order 1,081 new train cars, which would increase the
          number of seats in the fleet by 49 percent. Upon successful completion of initial testing of 10
          pilot cars, these cars will be put into revenue service. Delivery of production cars will begin in
          mid-2017. A total of 775 cars have been ordered and the schedule calls for 60 new cars in
          service by the end of 2017, 230 by 2018, 420 by 2019, 610 by 2020, and 775 by 2021.

4.1.3. Pedestrian Network
The Berkeley Pedestrian Master Plan establishes specific goals and recommendations to ensure that
walking in Berkeley is safe, attractive, easy, and convenient for people of all ages and abilities. The
Pedestrian Master Plan identified the top 100 intersections in need of infrastructure improvements and
grouped improvements into 34 projects prioritized based on safety, usage levels, and access to major
destinations. The City is currently working to implement these high priority projects, which include the
following improvements within the study area (the identification number of each Berkeley Pedestrian
Master Plan priority project is indicated in parentheses):

     x    University Avenue and Shattuck Avenue (#2)
               o Improvements to this intersection are being completed as part of the Shattuck
                 Reconfiguration Project
     x    Martin Luther King Jr Way from Allston Way to University Avenue (#6)
               o This improvement consists of: bulbouts at the west side of Center Street, south side of
                 Addison Street, and all corners of University Avenue; pedestrian actuated beacon for
                 Addison Street crossing; audible pedestrian signals at Allston Way; perpendicular curb
                 ramps with truncated domes; advance warning signage and truncated domes for
                 uncontrolled crosswalk across Addison Street at McKinley Street.
     x    University Avenue and Milvia Street (#7)
               o This improvement consists of: bulbouts on the southeast corner of the intersection;
                 signal timing modifications to eliminate left-turn conflicts at the off-set intersection
     x    Shattuck Avenue at Berkeley Way (#16)
               o This improvement consists of: high-visibility ladder crosswalk markings across both legs
                 of Shattuck Avenue; bulbouts at all corners; and, CA-MUTCD pedestrian warning signage
                 at crosswalk locations.
     x    Hearst Campus Sidewalk (#32)
               o The Hearst Avenue sidewalk is being reconstructed as part of the Hearst Avenue
                 Complete Streets Project.
     x    Additional improvements identified in the plan include:
               o ADA Improvements at multiple locations. Installation of perpendicular curb ramps and
                 truncated domes.
               o Signalized Intersection Enhancements at multiple locations. Installation of pedestrian-
                 friendly signal timing and countdown signals.
               o Corridor Streetscape Improvements

4.1.4. Bicycle Network
Berkeley is currently in the process of updating its Bicycle Master Plan. The current Berkeley Bicycle
Master Plan was adopted in 2000 and updated in 2005. A Draft Bicycle Master Plan Update was
released in October 2016 and identified the following improvements within the study area:

     x    Class IIA Standard Bike Lane
               o Center Street from Oxford Street to Shattuck Avenue7
     x    Class IIB Upgraded Bike Lane
               o Channing Way from Piedmont Avenue to Martin Luther King Jr Way
     x    Class IIIE Bicycle Boulevard
               o Addison Street from Oxford Street to Bolivar Drive and Berkeley Marina
     x    Class IVB Separated Bikeway
               o Milvia Street from University Avenue to Blake Street
               o Shattuck Avenue from Rose Street to Woolsey Street
               o Oxford-Fulton Street from Hearst Avenue to Blake Street
               o University Avenue from Oxford Street to Fourth Street
               o Bancroft Way from Piedmont Avenue to Milvia Street


4.2. INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
Cumulative Conditions vehicle intersection level of service results are summarized in Table 7. Detailed
intersection level of service worksheets are included as Appendix D.

As shown by bold text in Table 7, the Shattuck Avenue/University Avenue intersection would
deteriorate from acceptable LOS D (43.9 seconds of delay) under Baseline Conditions to LOS F with
greater than 80 seconds of delay and a v/c ratio of 1.18 during the weekday PM peak hour under
Cumulative Conditions. With the Shattuck Avenue Reconfiguration Project, the westbound movement
will consist of one shared left /through lane, operating as a permitted left-tun, and one shared right
/through lane. The combination of the high westbound left-turning volume and permissive signal
phasing are the primary cause of the poor operations at this location.

  The City is considering converting this one block segment of Center Street to a shared street, or woonerf. These improvements would be
constructed in coordination with development of 2129 Shattuck Avenue.

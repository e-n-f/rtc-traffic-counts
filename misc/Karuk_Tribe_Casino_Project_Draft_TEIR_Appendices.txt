  a)   Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?

  b)   Substantially damage off-reservation scenic resources,
       including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and
       historic buildings within a state scenic highway?

  c)   Create a new source of substantial light or glare, which
       would adversely affect day or nighttime views of historic
       buildings or views in the area?


A.- C.      Refer to Section 3.2, Aesthetics.

II.      AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST RESOURCES
                                                                        Potentially     Less Than       Less than        No

  a)   Involve changes in the existing environment, which, due to
       their location or nature, could result in conversion of
       off-reservation farmland to non-agricultural use or
       conversion of off-reservation forest land to non-forest use?


A.          The project site is not designated for agricultural use or as forest land (Yreka, 2003).
            No off-reservation farmland would be converted to non-agricultural use nor would off-
            reservation forest land be converted to non-forest use as a result of the Proposed
            Project. No impact would occur and Agricultural and Forest Resources are not
            addressed in the Tribal Environmental Impact Report (TEIR).

       interfere substantially with groundwater recharge such that
       there should be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering
       of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate
       of pre-existing nearby wells would drop to a level which
       would not support existing land uses or planned uses for
       which permits have been granted)?

  c)   Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or
       area, including through the alteration of the course of a
       stream or river, in a manner which would result in substantial
       erosion of siltation off-site?

  d)   Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or
       area, including through the alteration of the course of a
       stream or river, or substantially increase the rate or amount
       of surface runoff in a manner which would result in flooding
       off-site?

  e)   Create or contribute runoff water which would exceed the
       capacity of existing or planned storm water drainage
       systems or provide substantial additional sources of polluted
       runoff off-reservation?

  f)   Place within a 100-year flood hazard area structures, which
       would impede or redirect off-reservation flood flows?

  g)   Expose off-reservation people or structures to a significant
       risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including
       flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam?

ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE DRAFT TRIBAL-STATE GAMING
COMPACT
Section 11.0 of the Compact requires that a TEIR be prepared and provide detailed information about
potential off-reservation environmental effects which may be caused by the Proposed Project and methods
by which significant effects to the off-reservation environment could be minimized. Environmental effects
are defined in the Off-Reservation Environmental Impact Analysis Checklist which is included as an exhibit
to the Compact (Checklist) and is included as Attachment A. The Tribe has determined that the Proposed
Project may have a significant effect on the off-reservation environment and therefore is moving forward
with the preparation of a TEIR in anticipation of a fully-executed Compact prior to completion of this TEIR
environmental review process.

PROJECT INFORMATION
Site Location
The Proposed Project is located in Yreka, California (Figure 1). It would be constructed on approximately
60 acres of tribal lands (Project Site) west of the Tribe's existing Yreka housing development (Figure 2).
The gaming facility would be constructed on approximately 10 acres of tribal lands held in trust by the
federal government. The remaining 50 acres of the Project Site are located adjacent and south of the
gaming site and are owned by the Tribe in fee title. Regional access is provided by I-5 via the Moonlit Oak
Avenue exit south of the Project Site. Through Yreka, I-5 is a four-lane highway with below grade
intersections 0.8-mile south, 1.2-miles north, and 1.8 miles north of the Project Site.

Description of the Project
The Karuk Tribe (Tribe) proposes to develop a Class III Gaming Complex in two phases. Phase I would
include a 36,000 square-foot facility to accommodate approximately 500 gaming machines and 8 table
games, a 100-seat restaurant, and on-site parking (approximately 334 stalls). Additional parking
(approximately 222 stalls) would be developed on the adjacent tribally-owned lands south of the gaming
parcel with access to the Project Site provided from Sharps Road.

Phase II would include the addition of approximately 20,000 square feet to the gaming complex to add
approximately 300 gaming machines, 8 table games, new restaurant space, and associated facilities. In
addition, Phase II would include an 80-room, 48,000 square-foot hotel and an additional approximately 500
parking spaces.

Water supply and wastewater disposal services would be provided by the Yreka Public Utilities
Department. The preliminary site plan for the two phases is provided as Figure 3.

Potential Off-Reservation Environmental Effects
The following section discusses potential adverse off-reservation environmental impacts associated with
the Proposed Project. These potential impacts will be examined in the TEIR using the significance criteria
presented in the Checklist. The TEIR will evaluate the extent to which the Proposed Project's mitigation
measures, in combination with adopted governmental requirements, would mitigate potentially adverse off-
reservation environmental impacts. The TEIR will identify any expected significant off-reservation
adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated. The TEIR will provide analysis of the Proposed Project's off-
reservation impacts including, but not limited to, the following resource areas in accordance with the
Checklist:

Land Use
The Proposed Project site is located within an area developed with light industrial land uses. The Proposed
Project is generally compatible with surrounding designated land uses. The TEIR will include an analysis
of the Proposed Project's off-reservation impact on surrounding land uses.

Population and Housing
The Proposed Project would provide new employment opportunities; however, it is likely to have a less
than significant impact on off-reservation housing and growth-inducement as the majority of the new
employees would already reside within commuting distance of the Proposed Project.

Transportation and Circulation
The Proposed Project would generate additional vehicular use of local roadways, contributing to increased
traffic volumes. Potential impacts to off-reservation roads during the construction and operational phases
of the Proposed Project will be evaluated. The TEIR will include an analysis of the Proposed Project's
cumulative off-reservation impact on the regional transportation system and will discuss potential
mitigation measures.

Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Noise
Construction of the Proposed Project would generate short-term emissions, including dust and greenhouse
gases (GHGs), which could contribute to existing or projected off-reservation air quality exceedances. The
Proposed Project would also generate air emissions including GHGs through the addition of vehicular

traffic to the area's roadway system. Construction activity would increase noise levels in the area during
the construction phase, and increased traffic trips generated by the Proposed Project would also create
noise. The Proposed Project's off-reservation impact on air quality, including GHGs, and noise will be
evaluated in the TEIR.

Hydrology and Water Quality
In the absence of appropriate mitigation measures, the Proposed Project has the potential to result in
impacts to off-reservation surface water quality from discharges to surface waters during and after
construction. Post-construction impacts could result from the concentration of stormwater runoff by
impervious surfaces. During periods of wet weather, stormwater would flow over on-reservation roadway
surfaces, parking lots, and other impervious surfaces, which could carry pollutants and sediment to local
off-reservation water bodies such as Yreka Creek. Assessment of the Proposed Project's impacts to off-
reservation drainage patterns, groundwater, and water quality will be conducted as part of the TEIR. The
TEIR will also discuss potential erosion control and other mitigation measures to minimize off-reservation
impacts to water quality.

Biological and Cultural Resources
Direct impacts to off-reservation biological habitat and cultural resources could be significant if special-
status species or historical properties are located on tribal fee lands. The TEIR will evaluate the potential
off-reservation impacts to biological and cultural resources as a result of the Proposed Project.

Aesthetics
The Proposed Project site is located in an area of the City of Yreka designated for light industrial uses, and
the proposed casino and hotel would be visible from I-5. Surrounding land uses include industrial
facilities, open space, and residential. The TEIR will evaluate potential changes to the existing visual
character and quality of the area, including light and glare effects. The TEIR will assess the off-reservation
aesthetic impacts and identify mitigation measures, if necessary.

Hazards and Hazardous Materials
The TEIR will evaluate potential off-reservation impacts associated with hazards and hazardous materials
resulting from the Proposed Project.

Public Services and Utilities
The Proposed Project would create additional demand for public services (fire protection, law enforcement)
and utility services (water supply, wastewater treatment, electricity/natural gas, communication services).
The TEIR will discuss potential impacts to service providers, as well as applicable mitigation measures.

Geology and Soils
The Proposed Project would be developed in an area with steep grades and would require grading and hill
stabilization. The TEIR will discuss potential impacts to geology and soils, as well as applicable mitigation
measures.

      considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of
      past, current, or probable future projects.

 ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE DRAFT TRIBAL-STATE GAMING
 COMPACT
 Section 11.0 of the Compact requires that a TEIR be prepared and provide detailed information about
 potential off-reservation environmental effects which may be caused by the Proposed Project and methods
 by which significant effects to the off-reservation environment could be minimized. Environmental effects
 are defined in the Off-Reservation Environmental Impact Analysis Checklist which is included as an exhibit
 to the Compact (Checklist) and is included as Attachment A. The Tribe has determined that the Proposed
 Project may have a significant effect on the off-reservation environment and therefore is moving forward
 with the preparation of a TEIR in anticipation of a fully-executed Compact prior to completion of this TEIR
 environmental review process.

 PROJECTINFO~TION

 Site Location
 The Proposed Project is located in Yreka, California (Figure 1). It would be constructed on approximately
 60 acres of tribal lands (Project Site) west of the Tribe's existing Yreka housing development (Figure 2).
 The g~ing facility would be constructed on approximately 10 acres of tribaUands held in trust by the
 federal government. The remaining 50 acres of the Project Site are located adjacent and south of the
 gaming site and are owned by the Tribe in fee title. Regional access is provided·by 1-5 via the Moonlit Oak
. Avenue exit south of the Project Site. Through Yreka, 1-5 is a four-lane highway with below grade
 intersections 0.8-mile south, 1.2-miles north, and 1.8 miles north of the Project Site.

 ][)escription of the Project
.The Karuk Tribe (Tribe) proposes to develop a Class III Gaming Complex in two phases. Phase I would
 include a 36,000 square~foot facility to accommodate approximately 500 gaming machines and 8 table
 games, a 100-seat restaurant, and on-site parking (approximately 334 stalls). Additional parking
 (approximately 222· stalls) would be developed on the adjacent tribally-owned lands south. of the gaming
 parcel with access to the ProjectSite provided from Sharps Road.

Dear Mr. Quinn:

Thank you for the opportunity to review the Notice of Preparation of a Tribal Environmental Impact
Report (NOP TEIR) for the development of a Class III Gaming Complex in two phases. Phase I would
develop a 36,000 square foot facility on land held in Trust to accommodate approximately SOO gaming
machines and eight table games, a 100-seat restaurant, and 334 on-site parking spaces. An additional
222 parking spaces would be developed on the adjacent tribally-owned lands south of the gaming parcel
with access to the facility provided from Sharps Road. Phase II would include the addition of
approximately 20,000 square feet to the gaming complex to add approximately 300 gaming machines,
eight table games, new restaurant space, and associated facilities. In addition Phase II would include an
80-room 48,000 square foot hotel and an additional SOO parking spaces. The project is located northeast
ofthe South Yreka/Interstate S (I-S) interchange in the City of Yreka.

We appreciate the Tribe having previously provided early consultation information. We request
consultation in the development of the traffic study for the traffic and circulation impact analysis.
Agreement between Caltrans and the Tribe on the scope of work for the traffic study, which includes
agreement on trip generation rates and trip distribution assumptions, will assist in reaching agreement on
the results of the traffic study. We will be reviewing the following regarding development of the traffic
study:

   ·   Trip generation rates for casinos can vary, agreement on acceptable trip rates to be used in the
       study is critical. We will require documentation of the traffic study data sources, including any
       adjustment factors or other modifications. If from published data, cite the source and the publish
       date.
   ·   Dates and times of traffic counts, and whether any adjustment factor is included. Identify and
       state the adjustment factor.
   ·   The trip distribution will determine the highway road segments that need to be analyzed.
   ·   The project is proposed to be phased. Please prepare an analysis reflecting both phases, project
       time frames, and timing of proposed mitigation improvements.
   ·   Please use the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology. If any modeling or
       simulation is needed, the software program should be agreed on.

    ·   Caltrans requests that electronic copies of the traffic analysis be provided, including all input and
        output files with enough time to complete an independent analysis of the traffic study. As part of
        the consultation process and to expedite the review of the technical data we would appreciate the
        opportunity to identify potential errors or omissions prior to incorporation of the analysis into the
        Draft TEIR. We suggest that the technical data be provided to Caltrans for review at the
        administrative draft stage or sooner. At a minimum, we request that we be able to review the
        raw traffic study data.
   ·    Please consider the needs of pedestrian and bicycles facilities, along with a safety evaluation to
        allow for the safe use by pedestrian and bicycles in the project area.

In summary, Caltrans recognizes the unique sovereign status of the Tribe and is committed to
strengthening the Government-to-Government relationship with the Tribe. To restate, prior to initiating
the traffic study, as part of the scoping and consultation process, Caltrans requests that the Tribe obtain
agreement by Caltrans on the assumptions and trip distribution.

We look forward to working with the Tribe in reviewing the potential traffic impacts and whether
improvements will be necessary to improve access to the gaming complex and related facilities. If you
have any questions, please call me at (530) 225-5532 or email atmarcelino_gonzalez@dot.ca.gov.

Subject: Notice of Preparation (NOP) Karuk Tribe Casino Project
         SCH# 2013072048, Siskiyou County, California

Dear Mr. Quinn:

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife, (Department) has reviewed the Notice of
Preparation (NOP) for the draft Tribal Environmental Impact Report (TEIR) for the Karuk
Tribe Casino Project (State Clearinghouse Number: 2013072048), hereinafter referred
to as the "Project". The Project is located in Yreka, California, east of Interstate 5,and
south of Oberlin Road. The Department appreciates this opportunity to comment on the
above-referenced Project, relative to impacts to biological resources.

The Department is a Trustee Agency pursuant to the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). A Trustee Agency has jurisdiction over certain resources held in trust for
the people of California. Trustee agencies are generally required to be notified of
CEQA documents relevant to their jurisdiction, whether or not these agencies have
actual permitting authority or approval power over aspects of the underlying project
(CEQA Guidelines, Section 15386). As the Trustee Agency for fish and wildlife
resources, the Department provides requisite biological expertise to review and
comment upon CEQA documents, and makes recommendations regarding those
resources held in trust for the people of California.
                                                                        .
The Department may also assume the role of Responsible Agency. A Responsible
Agency is an agency other than the Lead Agency that has a legal responsibility for
carrying out or approving a project. A Responsible Agency actively participates in the
Lead Agency's CEQA process, reviews the Lead Agency's CEQA document and uses
that document when making a decision on a project. The Responsible Agency must
rely on the Lead Agency's CEQA document to prepare and issue its own findings
regarding a project (CEQA Guidelines, Sections 15096 and 15381). The Department
most often becomes a Responsible Agency when a Lake or Streambed Alteration
Agreement (Fish and Game Code Section 1600 et. seq.) or a California Endangered
Species Act Incidental Take Permit (Fish and Game Code Section 2081 (b» is needed
for a project. The Department relies on the CEQA document prepared by the Lead
Agency to make a finding and decide whether or not to issue the permit or agreement.
It is important that the Lead Agency's Environmental Impact Report (EIR) considers the
Department's Responsible Agency requirements. For example, CEQA requires the
Department to include additional feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures

within its powers, that would substantially lessen or avoid any significant effect a project
would have on the environment (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15096 (g)(2). Under certain
conditions, the Department may be required to assume the role of the Lead Agency
(see CEQA Guidelines, Section 15052) during the course of issuing a permit or
agreement.

Project Description

The Project, according to the NOP letter, states that the "Karuk Tribe (Tribe) proposes
to develop a Class III Gaming Complex in two phases. Phase I would include a 36,000
square-foot facility to accommodate approximately 500 gaming machines and 8 table
games, a 100-seat restaurant, and on-site parking (approximately 334 stalls).
Additional parking (approximately 222 stalls) would be developed on the adjacent
tribally-owned lands south of the gaming parcel with access to the Project Site provided
from Sharps Road. Phase II would include the addition of approximately 20,000 square
feet to the gaming complex to add approximately 300 gaming machines, 8 table games,
new restaurant space, and associated facilities" In addition, Phase II would include an
80-room, 48,000 square-foot hotel and an additional approximately 500 parking spaces.
Water supply and wastewater disposal services would be provided by the Yreka Public
Utilities Department." The gaming facility would be constructed on approximately 60
acres of tribal lands; 10 acres is held in trust by the federal government, and the
remaining 50 acres is owned by the Tribe in fee title. The Department is commenting
on the 50 acres owned by the Tribe in fee title.

The Department is a Trustee Agency and a Responsible Agency for the Project. To
enable Department staff to adequately review and comment on the proposed Project,
we recommend the following information be included in the draft TEIR, as applicable:

   1.     A complete assessment of the flora and fauna within and adjacent to the
          Project area should be conducted, with particular emphasis upon identifying
          special status species including rare, threatened, and endangered species.
          This assessment should also address locally unique species, rare natural
          communities, and wetlands. The assessment area for the Project should be
          large enough to encompass areas potentially subject to both direct and
          indirect Project effects. Both the Project footprint and the assessment area (if
          different) should be clearly defined and mapped in the TEIR.

          a.      The Department's California Natural Diversity Data Base (CNDDB)
                  should be searched to obtain current information on previously
                  reported sensitive species and habitat, including Significant Natural
                  Areas identified under Chapter 12 of the Fish and Game Code. In
                  order to provide an adequate assessment of special-status species
                  potentially occurring within the Project vicinity, the search area for
                  CNDDB occurrences should include all U. S. Geological Survey. 7.5-
                  minute topographic quadrangles with Project activities, and all
Mr. Scott Quinn

                      adjoining 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles. The TEIR should
                      discuss how and when the CNDDS search was conducted, including
                      the names of each quadrangle queried, or why any areas may have
                      been intentionally excluded from the NDDS query.

              b.    ··AG0mpleteassessrnent0f.rare,threatened,andendangered.
                     invertebrate, fish, wildlife, reptile, and amphibian species should be
                     presented in the TEIR. Rare, threatened, and endangered species to
                     be addressed shall include all those which meet the CEQA definition
                     (see CEQA Guidelines, § 15380). Seasonal variations in use of the
                     Project area should also be addressed. Focused species-specific
                     surveys, conducted at the appropriate time of year and time of day
                     when the species are active or otherwise identifiable, are required.
                     Acceptable species-specific survey procedures should be developed in
                     consultation with the Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
                     Service. Links to some survey procedures are provided on the
                     Department's websitR 1

              c.      Species of Special Concern (SSC) status applies to animals generally
                      not listed under the federal Endangered Species Act or the California
                      Endangered Species Act, but which nonetheless are declining at a rate
                      that could result in listing, or historically occurred in low numbers and
                      known threats to their persistence currently exist. SSC's should be
                      considered during the environmental review process.

              d.     Fully Protected (FP) animals may not be taken or possessed at any
                     time and the Department is not authorized to issue permits or licenses
                     for their incidental take2 . FP animals should be considered during the
                     environmental review process and all Project-related take must be
                     avoided.

              e.     A thorough assessment of rare plants and rare natural communities
                     should be conducted, following the Department's November 2009
                     Protocols for Surveying and Evaluating Impacts to Special Status
                     Native Plant Populations and Natural Communities (Attachment 1).

              f.     A detailed vegetation map should be prepared, preferably overlaid on
                     an aerial photograph. The map should be of sufficient resolution to
                     depict the locations of the Project site's major vegetation communities,

                  and show Project impacts relative to each community type. The
                  vegetation classification system used to name the polygons should be
                  described. Special Status natural communities should be specifically
                  noted on the map.

         g ... ·····TheTsl Rshouldincludesurvey methods,. dates,-andresults;and
                   should list all plant and animal species detected within the Project
                   study area. Special emphasis should be directed toward describing
                   the status of rare, threatened, and endangered species in all areas
                   potentially affected by the Project. All necessary biological surveys
                   should be conducted in advance of TEIR circulation, and should not be
                   deferred until after Project approval.

  2. A thorough discussion of direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts expected to
         adversely affect biological resources, with specific measures to offset such
         impacts, should be included.

         a.       The TEIR should present clear thresholds of significance to be used by
                  the Lead Agency in its determination of environmental effects. A
                  threshold of significance is an identifiable quantitative, qualitative or
                  performance level of a particular environmental effect.

         b.       CEQA Guidelines, § 15125, direct that knowledge of environmental
                  conditions at both the local and regional levels is critical to an
                  assessment of environmental impacts and that special emphasis shall
                  be placed on resources that are rare or unique to the region.


         c.       Impacts associated with initial Project implementation as well as long-
                  term operation and maintenance of the Project shall be addressed in
                  the TEIR pursuant to CEQA Guidelines 15126.2 (a).

        d.        In evaluating the significance of the environmental effect of the Project,
                  the Lead Agency should consider direct physical changes in the
                  environment which may be caused by the Project, and reasonably
                  foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment which may
                  be caused by the Project. Expected impacts should be quantified
                  (e.g., acres, linear feet, number of individuals taken, volume or rate of
                  water extracted, etc. to the extent feasible).

        e.        Project impacts should be analyzed relative to their effects on off-site
                  habitats and species. Specifically, this may include public lands, open
                  space, downstream aquatic habitats, areas of groundwater depletion,
                  or any other natural habitat or species that could be affected by the
                  Project.

         f.       Impacts to and maintenance of wildlife corridor/movement areas and
                  other key seasonal use areas should be fully evaluated and provided.

                  dogs and cats, changes in drainage patterns, changes in water
                  volume, velocity, quantity, and quality, soil erosion, and/or
                  sedimentation in streams and water courses on or near the Project
                  site.

         h.       A cumulative effects analysis shall be developed for species and
                  habitats potentially affected by the Project. This analysis shall be
                  conducted as described under CEQA Guidelines, § 15130. General
                  and specific plans, as well as past, present, and anticipated future
                  projects, should be analyzed relative to their impacts to species and
                  habitats"

  3.     A range of Project alternatives shall be analyzed to ensure that the full
         spectrum of alternatives to the proposed Project are fully considered and
         evaluated. Alternatives which avoid or otherwise minimize impacts to
         sensitive biological resources shall be identified.


         a.       If the Project will result in any impacts described under the Mandatory
                  Findings of Significance (CEQA Guidelines, § 15065) the impacts must
                  be analyzed in depth in the TEIR, and the Lead Agency is required to
                  make detailed findings on the feasibility of alternatives or mitigation
                  measures to substantially lessen or avoid the significant effects on the
                  environment. When mitigation measures or Project changes are found
                  to be feasible, such measures should be incorporated into the Project
                  to lessen or avoid significant effects.

  4.    Mitigation measures for adverse Project~related impacts to sensitive plants,
        animals, and habitats should be developed and thoroughly discussed.
        Mitigation measures should first emphasize avoidance and reduction of
        Project impacts. For unavoidable impacts, the feasibility of on~site habitat
        restoration or enhancement should be discussed. If on-site mitigation is not
        feasible, off-site mitigation through habitat creation, enhancement,
        acquisition, and preservation in perpetuity should be addressed.

  5.    The Department has responsibility for wetland and riparian habitats. It is the
        policy of the Department to strongly discourage development in wetlands or
        conversion of wetlands to uplands. We oppose any development or
        conversion which would result in a reduction of wetland acreage or wetland

            habitat values, unless, at a minimum, Project mitigation assures there will be
            "no net loss" of either wetland habitat values or acreage. The TEIR should
            demonstrate that the Project will not result in a net loss of wetland habitat
            values or acreage.

            a.·    If thePmjeGt-sitehas thepotential-tosuppol"taquatic, riparian, or
                   wetland habitat, a delineation of lakes, streams, and associated
                   riparian habitats potentially affected by the Project should be provided
                   for agency and public review. This report should include a preliminary
                   jurisdictional delineation including wetlands identification pursuant to
                   the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service wetland definition3 as adopted by
                   the Department4 . Please note that some wetland and riparian habitats
                   subject to the Department's authority may extend beyond the
                   jurisdictional limits of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The
                   jurisdictional delineation should also include mapping of ephemeral,
                   intermittent, and perennial stream courses potentially impacted by the
                   Project !n addition to "federally protected wetlands" (see CEQA
                   Appendix G), the Department considers impacts to any wetlands (as
                   defined by the Department) as potentially significant.

The Department has identified the following specific environmental issues that need to
be explored in the draft TEIR:

      1.    The Department recognizes the effects of artificial lighting on birds and other
            nocturnal species. The effects are numerous and include changes in singing
            and foraging behavior and even altered migration patterns. To minimize
            adverse effects of artificial lighting, the Department recommends lighting
            fixtures for the Project be fully shielded and designed and installed to
            minimize photo pollution.

      2.   If the trees and other vegetation located on the property are to be removed,
           the Department requests they do so outside the normal nesting season for
           both raptors and migratory bird species which occurs roughly from February 1
           through August 31.

      3.   The following plant species are located near the project site: woolly
           meadowfoam (Limnanthes floccosa ssp. floccosa)- California Rare Plant
           Rank (CRPR) 4.2, Peck's lomatium (Lomatium peckianum) - CRPR 2.2,

                   recommended that these species be included in protocol level plant surveys.

            4.     Stormwater and landscaping runoff should be discussed thoroughly in the
                   TEIR. There appears to be a small drainage just south of the proposed
                   parking lot; on-site stormwater treatment may be designed to be compatible
                   with and support this habitat.

                                             INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

The conservation of special status native plants and their habitats, as well as natural communities, is integral to
maintaining biological diversity. The purpose of these protocols is to facilitate a consistent and systematic approach
to the survey and assessment of special status native plants and natural communities so that reliable information is
produced and the potential of locating a special status plant species or natural community is maximized. They may
also help those who prepare and review environmental documents determine when a botanical survey is needed,
how field surveys may be conducted, what information to include in a survey report, and what qualifications to
consider for surveyors. The protocols may help avoid delays caused when inadequate biological information is
provided during the environmental review process; assist lead, trustee and responsible reviewing agencies to make
an informed decision regarding the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of a proposed development, activity, or
action on special status native plants and natural communities; meet California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)2
requirements for adequate disclosure of potential impacts; and conserve public trust resources.


             DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME TRUSTEE AND RESPONSIBLE AGENCY MISSION

The mission of the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is to manage California's diverse wildlife and native plant
resources, and the habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by
the public. DFG has jurisdiction over the conservation, protection, and management of wildlife, native plants, and
habitat necessary to maintain biologically sustainable populations (Fish and Game Code §1802). DFG, as trustee
agency under CEQA §15386, provides expertise in reviewing and commenting on environmental documents and
makes protocols regarding potential negative impacts to those resources held in trust for the people of California.

Certain species are in danger of extinction because their habitats have been severely reduced in acreage, are
threatened with destruction or adverse modification, or because of a combination of these and other factors. The
California Endangered Species Act (CESA) provides additional protections for such species, including take
prohibitions (Fish and Game Code §2050 et seq.). As a responsible agency, DFG has the authority to issue permits
for the take of species listed under CESA if the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity; DFG has determined
that the impacts of the take have been minimized and fully mitigated; and, the take would not jeopardize the
continued existence of the species (Fish and Game Code §2081). Surveys are one of the preliminary steps to detect
a listed or special status plant species or natural community that may be impacted significantly by a project.


                                                         DEFINITIONS

Botanical surveys provide information used to determine the potential environmental effects of proposed projects on
all special status plants and natural communities as required by law (Le., CEQA, CESA, and Federal Endangered
Species Act (ESA». Some key terms in this document appear in bold font for assistance in use of the document.

For the purposes of this document, special status plants include all plant species that meet one or more of the
following criteria 3 :

         listing as threatened or endangered under the ESA (50 CFR §17.12).

    ·    Listed 4 or candidates for listing by the State of California as threatened or endangered under CESA (Fish
         and Game Code §2050 et seq.). A species, subspecies, or variety of plant is endangered when the
         prospects of its survival and reproduction in the wild are in immediate jeopardy from one or more causes,
         including loss of habitat, change in habitat, over-exploitation, predation, competition, disease, or other
         factors (Fish and Game Code §2062). A plant is threatened when it is likely to become endangered in the
         foreseeable future in the absence of special protection and management measures (Fish and Game Code
         §2067);

    ·    Listed as rare under the California Native Plant Protection Act (Fish and Game Code §1900 et seq.). A
         plant is rare when, although not presently threatened with extinction, the species, subspecies, or variety is
         found in such small numbers throughout its range that it may be endangered if its environment worsens
         (Fish and Game Code §1901).

    ·    Meet the definition of rare or endangered under CEQA §153S0(b) and (d). Species that may meet the
         definition of rare or endangered include the following:

         ·    Species considered by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) to be "rare, threatened or
              endangered in California" (Lists 1A, 1B and 2);

         ·    Species that may warrant consideration on the basis of local significance or recent biological
              information5 ;                                                          .

          designated in local or regional plans, policies, or ordinances (CEOA Guidelines, Appendix G). Examples
          include a species at the outer limits of its known range or a species occurring on an uncommon soil type.

Special status natural communities are communities that are of limited distribution statewide or within a county or
region and are often vulnerable to environmental effects of projects. These communities mayor may not contain
special status species or their habitat. The most current version of the Department's List of California Terrestrial
Natural Communities7 indicates which natural communities are of special status given the current state of the
California classification.

Most types of wetlands and riparian communities are considered special status natural communities due to their
limited distribution in California. These natural communities often contain special status plants such as those
described above. These protocols may be used in conjunction with protocols formulated by other a~encies, for
example, those developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to delineate jurisdictional wetlands or by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to survey for the presence of special status plants9·

    In general, CNPS List 3 plants (plants about which more information is needed) and List 4 plants (plants of limited distribution) may
    not warrant consideration under CEQA §15380. These plants may be included on special status plant lists such as those developed
    by counties where they would be addressed under CEQA §15380. List 3 plants may be analyzed under CEQA §15380 if sufficient
    information is available to assess potential impacts to such plants. Factors such as regional rarity vs. statewide rarity should be
    considered in determining whether cumulative impacts to a List 4 plant are significant even if individual project impacts are not. List
    3 and 4 plants are also included in the California Natural Diversity Database's (CNDDB) Special Plants, Bryophytes, and Lichens
    List. [Refer to the current online published list available at http://www.dfg.ca.gov/biogeodata.] Data on Lists 3 and 4 plants should

                                                      BOTANICAL SURVEYS

Conduct botanical surveys prior to the commencement of any activities that may modify vegetation, such as
clearing, mowing, or ground-breaking activities. It is appropriate to conduct a botanical field survey when:
     ·    Natural (or naturalized) vegetation occurs on the site, and it is unknown if special status plant species or
          natural communities occur on the site, and the project has the potential for direct or indirect effects on
          vegetation; or
     ·    Special status plants or natural communities have historically been identified on the project site; or
     ·    Special status plants or natural communities occur on sites with similar physicaland biological properties as
          the project site.


SURVEY OBJECTIVES
     Conduct field surveys in a manner which maximizes the likelihood of locating special status plant species or
     special status natural communities that may be present. Surveys should be floristic in nature, meaning that
     every plant taxon that occurs on site is identified to the taxonomic level necessary to determine rarity and listing
     status. "Focused surveys" that are limited to habitats known to support special status species or are restricted
     to lists of likely potential species are not considered floristic in nature and are not adequate to identify all plant
     taxa on site to the level necessary to determine rarity and listing status. Include a list of plants and natural
     communities detected on the site for each botanical survey conducted. More than one field visit may be
     necessary to adequately capture the floristic diversity of a site. An indication of the prevalence (estimated total
     numbers, percent cover, density, etc.) of the species and communities on the site is also useful to assess the
     significance of a particular population.


SURVEY PREPARATION
     Before field surveys are conducted, compile relevant botanical information in the general project area to provide
     a regional context for the investigators. Consult the CNDDB 10 and BIOS11 for known occurrences of special
     status plants and natural communities in the project area prior to field surveys. Generally, identify vegetation
     and habitat types potentially: occurring in the project area based on biological and physical properties of the site
     and surrounding ecoregion 2, unless a larger assessment area is appropriate. Then, develop a list of special
     status plants with the potential to occur within these vegetation types. This list can serve as a tool for the
     investigators and facilitate the use of reference sites; however, special status plants on site might not be limited
     to those on the list. Field surveys and subsequent reporting should be comprehensive and floristic in nature and
     not restricted to or focused only on this list. Include in the survey report the list of potential special status
     species and natural communities, and the list of references used to compile the background botanical
     information for the site.


SURVEY EXTENT
     Surveys should be comprehensive over the entire site, including areas that will be directly or indirectly impacted
     by the project. Adjoining properties should also be surveyed where direct or indirect project effects, such as
     those from fuel modification or herbicide application, could potentially extend offsite. Pre-project surveys
     restricted to known CNDDB rare plant locations may not identify all special status plants and communities
     present and do not provide a sufficient level of information to determine potential impacts.


FIELD SURVEY METHOD
     Conduct surveys using systematic field techniques in all habitats of the site to ensure thorough coverage of
     potential impact areas. The level of effort required per given area and habitat is dependent upon the vegetation
     and its overall diversity and structural complexity, which determines the distance at which plants can be
     identified. Conduct surveys by walking over the entire site to ensure thorough coverage, noting all plant taxa

      observed. The level of effort should be sufficient to provide comprehensive reporting. For example, one
      person-hour per eight acres per survey date is needed for a comprehensive field survey in grassland with
      medium diversity and moderate terrain 13, with additional time allocated for species identification.


TIMING AND NUMBER OF VISITS
      Conduct surveys in the field at the time of year when species are both evident and identifiable. Usually this is
      during flowering or fruiting. Space visits throughout the growing season to accurately determine what plants
      exist on site. Many times this may involve multiple visits to the same site (e.g. in early, mid, and late-season for
      f1owerinftplants)to capture the floristic dive[sity ala levelnecessarytodetermJne jf$pecial status plants are
      present 4. The timing and number of visits are determined by geographic location, the natural communities
      present, and the weather patterns of the year(s) in which the surveys are conducted.


REFERENCE SITES
      When special status plants are known to occur in the type(s) of habitat present in the project area, observe
      reference sites (nearby accessible occurrences of the plants) to determine whether those species are
      identifiable at the time of the survey and to obtain a visual image of the target species, associated habitat, and
      associated natural community.


USE OF EXISTING SURVEYS

      For some sites, floristic inventories or special status plant surveys may already exist. Additional surveys may be
      necessary for the following reasons:
      ·   Surveys are not current15 ; or
      ·   Surveys were conducted in natural systems that commonly experience year to year fluctuations such as
          periods of drought or flooding (e.g. vernal pool habitats or riverine systems); or
      ·   Surveys are not comprehensive in nature; or fire history, land use, physical conditions of the site, or climatic
          conditions have changed since the last survey was conducted 16 ; or
     ·    Surveys were conducted in natural systems where special status plants may not be observed if an annual
          above ground phase is not visible (e.g. flowers from a bulb); or
     ·    Changes in vegetation or species distribution may have occurred since the last survey was conducted, due
          to habitat alteration, fluctuations in species abundance and/or seed bank dynamics.


NEGATIVE SURVEYS
     Adverse conditions may prevent investigators from determining the presence of, or accurately identifying, some
     species in potential habitat of target species. Disease, drought, predation, or herbivory may preclude the
     presence or identification of target species in any given year. Discuss such conditions in the report.

       The failure to locate a known special status plant occurrence during one field season does not constitute
       evidence that this plant occurrence no longer exists at this location, particularly if adverse conditions are
       present. For example, surveys over a number of years may be necessary if the species is an annual plant
     . having a persistent, long-lived seed bank and is known not to germinate every year. Visits to the site in more

     Habitats, such as grasslands or desert plant communities that have annual and short-lived perennial plants as major floristic
     components may require yearly surveys to accurately document baseline conditions for purposes of impact assessment. In forested
     areas, however, surveys at intervals of five years may adequately represent current conditions. For forested areas, refer to

     further sUbstantiate negative findings for a known occurrence, a visit to a nearby reference site may ensure that
     the timing of the survey was appropriate.


                                            REPORTING AND DATA COLLECTION
Adequate information about special status plants and natural communities present in a project area will enable
reviewing agencies and the public to effectively assess potential impacts to special status plants or natural
communities 17 and will guide the development of minimization and mitigation measures. The next section describes
necessaPj-information to.assessimpacts.-Eorcomprehensive,systematicsulYeys where nospeci(3l~tc:ltusspecies
or natural communities were found, reporting and data collection responsibilities for investigators remain as
described below, excluding specific occurrence information.


SPECIAL STATUS PLANT OR NATURAL COMMUNITY OBSERVATIONS
     Record the following information for locations of each special status plant or natural community detected during
     a field survey of a project site.
     ·    A detailed map (1 :24,000 or larger) showing locations and boundaries of each special status species
          occurrence or natural community found as related to the proposed project. Mark occurrences and
          boundaries as accurately as possible. Locations documented by use of global positioning system (GPS)
          coordinates must include the datum18 in which they were collected;
     ·    The site-specific characteristics of occurrences, such as associated species, habitat and microhabitat,
          structure of vegetation, topographic features, soH type, textme, and soil parent material. !f the species is
          associated with a wetland, provide a description of the direction of flow and integrity of surface or
          subsurface hydrology and adjacent off-site hydrological influences as appropriate;
     ·    The number of individuals in each special status plant population as counted (if population is small) or
          estimated (if population is large);
     ·    If applicable, information about the percentage of individuals in each life stage such as seedlings vs.
          reproductive individuals;
     ·    The number of individuals of the species per unit area, identifying areas of relatively high, medium and low
          density of the species over the project site; and
     ·    Digital images of the target species and representative habitats to support information and descriptions.


FIELD SURVEY FORMS
     When a special status plant or natural community is located, complete and submit to the CNDDB a California
     Native Species (or Community) Field Survey Form 19 or equivalent written report, accompanied by a copy of the
     relevant portion of a 7.5 minute topographic map with the occurrence mapped. Present locations documented
     by use of GPS coordinates in map and digital form. Data submitted in digital form must include the datum20 in
     which it was collected. If a potentially undescribed special status natural community is found on the site,
     document it with a Rapid Assessment or Releve form 21 and submit it with the CNDDB form.


VOUCHER COLLECTION
     Voucher specimens provide verifiable documentation of species presence and identification as well as a public
     record of conditions. This information is vital to all conservation efforts. Collection of voucher specimens should

     and federal permit requirements (e.g. incidental take permit, scientific collection permit). Voucher collections of
     special status species (or suspected special status species) should be made only when such actions would not
     jeopardize the continued existence of the population or species.

Project:      Traffic Analysis for Sacramento Commons
Subject:      Trip Generation Comparison and Site Plan Review


Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) compared the trip generation of the proposed project’s revised land
use scenarios (dated October 2014) to the trip generation for land use scenarios evaluated in the July
2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons. As presented below, the October 2014 land
use scenarios result in either fewer or an equal number of net new trips as the land use scenarios
evaluated in the July 2014 report. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the findings documented in
the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons remain the same with the revised
October 2014 land uses.

KAI also reviewed the modifications to the driveway access from 7th Street to the parcel in the
northeast quadrant of the site. The revised site plan dated October 13, 2014 illustrates the driveway
in a slightly different location on 7th Street and also shows an increased driveway depth. The revised
location on 7th Street does not change the previous findings in the July 2014 report. The increased
driveway depth exceeds the previously identified minimum queue storage for driveway #2 in the July
2014 report. (Please see additional details in the Site Plan Review section, page 7.)


TRIP GENERATION METHODOLOGY
The same trip generation methodology was used to calculate the trip generation for the proposed
project’s revised land use scenarios dated October 2014 and the land use scenarios evaluated in the
July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons. The July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for
Sacramento Commons documents the methodology in greater detail. This section provides a brief
summary of the approach.

The trip generation for Sacramento Commons is based on information compiled by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, 2012 and Trip Generation Manual
User’s Guide and Handbook, 9th Edition, 2012), the travel mode shares from the travel survey at the

December 19, 2014                                                                                             Page 2


existing Capitol Towers apartment building (conducted in February 2008 and March 2008 at the site),
and the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report: Analysis of the 2000 SACOG House Travel Survey (DKS,
2001).

The following summarizes the land uses used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual to estimate the
initial automobile trips for the proposed project.

          Neighborhood Support/Retail (Parcel 1, 2A, 2B, 3 and 4A): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 820
           for a shopping center; it is a conservative estimate given that specific types of retail is not
           known at this time.

          High-Rise Apartments (Parcel 1 and Parcel 3): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 222, which is
           applicable to apartments in buildings with more than ten levels.

          Mid-Rise Apartments (Parcel 2A, 2B and 4B): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 223, which is
           applicable to apartments in buildings that have between three and ten levels. The ITE Trip
           Generation Manual does not include a weekday daily trip estimate for mid-rise apartments;
           therefore, to estimate the daily trips for the mid-rise apartments, ITE Trip Generation Land
           Use 221 for low-rise apartments was used. The low-rise apartment land use provides a more
           conservative estimate for daily trips than the high-rise apartment land use.

          Live-Work Units (Parcel 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4B): Live-work units were included as part of the
           residential trip generation numbers. These units are expected to house artists or incubator
           businesses where the decrease in trips due to residents working at home is expected to be
           similar to the number of clients visiting the unit. Therefore, trip generation for these units can
           be accounted for using the residential land use category.

          Hotel (Parcel 3 for the Hotel Scenario): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 310 directly applicable
           to hotels providing sleeping accommodations and supporting facilities (e.g., restaurants,
           retail, service shops).

The total automobile trip generation estimates for the proposed project were calculated as the
automobile trips generated by the proposed project minus the existing trips generated by the existing
land uses to be replaced at the project site.

The total automobile trip generation rates were adjusted to account for transit use, walking, biking
and internal trips. Below is a brief summary of these adjustments; the July 2014 Traffic Analysis
Report for Sacramento Commons presents additional information regarding these adjustments.

          Transit Trips
              o For the retail component of the proposed project, assumed 2.2 percent of total trips
                   would be transit trips.

December 19, 2014                                                                                                            Page 3


              o For the residential component of the proposed project, assumed:
                       4.9 percent of total number daily trips would be transit trips;
                       4.2 percent of a.m. peak hour trips would be transit trips; and
                       5.3 percent of p.m. peak hour trips would be transit trips.
          Walk, Bike and Other Non-Auto Trips
              o For the retail component of the proposed project, assumed 11.6 percent of total trips
                  were walk, bike and/or other non-auto trips.
              o For the residential component of the proposed project, assumed:
                       38.9 percent of the total number of daily trips to be walk, bike and/or other
                          non-auto trips;
                       40 percent of a.m. peak hour trips to be walk, bike and/or other non-auto
                          trips; and
                       38.8 percent of p.m. peak hour trips to be walk, bike and/or other non-auto
                          trips.

After the adjustments were made for transit, walk, bike, and other non-auto travel, an adjustment
was made to account for internal trips between different types of land uses within each parcel within
the proposed project. The internal trip adjustments were performed using procedures recommended
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers for multi-use developments (Trip Generation Handbook,
2012). Internal trips are trips that would occur between different land uses within the same site
without accessing the street system.

The project is expected to have a minimal amount of vehicle pass-by trips1. Given the small number of
these trip types, no pass-by trips were assumed for retail uses in the analysis in order to provide a
more conservative analysis.


TRIP GENERATION FROM JULY 2014 TRAFFIC ANALYSIS REPORT FOR
SACRAMENTO COMMONS
Table 1 and Table 2 show the automobile trip generation summary for the Hotel Scenario and No
Hotel Scenario of the proposed project, respectively. These tables correspond to Table 7 and Table 8
in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons.

Table 3 and Table 4 show the transit trip generation summary for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel
Scenario of the proposed project, respectively. These tables correspond to Table 9 and Table 10 in the
July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons.



1
    A pass-by trip is a project trip that is already on the streets adjacent to the project prior to construction. These trips
will visit the project site but will only impact project driveways and not nearby intersections since they are already
accounted for in traffic data collected for existing conditions.

As shown in Table 9 and Table 10, the October 2014 land uses generate fewer or an equal number of
net new trips for weekday daily and peak periods. The difference in number of trips ranges from zero
to a decrease in trips of 8.8%. Additionally, the trip distribution would be similar due to the minimal
changes in trip generation and the one-way street network of downtown Sacramento. Given the
October 2014 land uses result in either fewer or an equal number of net new trips and that the trip
distribution would be the similar, the findings documented in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for
Sacramento Commons can be considered a conservative estimate of transportation impacts related
to the Sacramento Commons development.


SITE PLAN REVIEW
KAI compared the October 13, 2014 site plan to the previous site plan dated May 20, 2014. The
revised October 2014 site plan illustrates the above driveway accessing 7 th Street approximately 15
feet further south than the previous site plan dated May 20, 2014. The revised driveway also
illustrates increased driveway depth onsite providing more inbound vehicle queue storage reducing
the likelihood of vehicles queuing onto 7th Street.

The revised location shown in the October 13, 2014 site plan does not change the findings
documented in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons. The revised driveway
depth exceeds the minimum two vehicle queue storage documented in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis
Report for Sacramento Commons, and thus, the recommendation to provide a minimum of two
vehicle queue storage is satisfied.

1          INTRODUCTION
This study assessed the potential transportation and circulation conditions associated with the proposed
Sacramento Commons project. Specifically, the transportation and circulation analysis addressed the
following impact categories:

          Intersections
          Transit
          Bicycle facilities
          Pedestrian circulation
          Construction-related traffic impacts

Weekday AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movements at thirteen study intersections and
seven proposed project driveways were analyzed (See Table 1.) The traffic analysis addressed the
change in traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the site due to trips generated by the proposed
project. An analysis of site access and vehicular circulation was also conducted.

Quantitative transportation analyses were conducted for the following conditions:

          Existing Conditions
          Existing Plus Project (Hotel Scenario)
          Existing Plus Project (No Hotel Scenario)
          Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions
          Cumulative 2035 Plus Project (Hotel Scenario)
          Cumulative 2035 Plus Project (No Hotel Scenario)

The Existing Conditions scenario represents the year 2014. The Cumulative 2035 No Project
Conditions are defined as the future year consistent with the regional forecasts from the SACMET
model, which is currently using the year 2035.

Impacts of the proposed project are defined according to City of Sacramento 2030 General Plan
thresholds of significance and CEQA standards. Mitigation measures are recommended to address
significant impacts to lessen their significance.


1.1        Project Description
The proposed project is located in Downtown Sacramento within the City’s Core Area1 at a site
bounded by N Street, P Street, 5th Street, and 7th Street in Sacramento, California. The proposed
project is a residential mixed-use project proposed on an approximately 10-acre infill site located
within close proximity to a variety of transit services.



1
    The Sacramento Core Area is the area bounded by C Street, the Sacramento River, 30th Street, and X Street.
                                                                                                      Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                     15604.105
July 31, 2014                                                                                             Page 2


The site is currently developed with 409 residential units, neighborhood-serving retail and commercial
space, recreational amenities (including a swimming pool), laundry facilities, various landscaped areas,
and a three-level parking structure with a capacity of up to 200 parking spaces and an additional 190
parking spaces in surface lots. The 409 units consist of 206 two- and three-story garden apartments and
203 units in the 15-story Capitol Towers building. Sharing the four-block project area, but not part of
the proposed project site, are the separately-owned 15-story 500 N Street condominium tower and the
12-story Pioneer Towers senior apartments. Therefore, the “project site” nomenclature used hereinafter
refers strictly to the proposed project’s boundaries (i.e., exclusive of 500 N Street and Pioneer Towers).

The proposed project has two different development options. The first option (i.e., Hotel Scenario)
would remove 206 existing garden apartment units and develop a 320-room hotel and construct up to
1,219 dwelling units including approximately 49 live/work units (residences that provide for offices,
artist studios or incubator businesses). This results in a total of up to 1,422 units onsite when including
the existing Capitol Towers building (203 units), resulting in an average density across the project site
of approximately 140 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The Hotel Scenario would also include the
addition of up to 69,122 square feet of neighborhood-serving retail or support space (including the
existing 4,122 square feet of retail uses within Capitol Tower) located at street level.

The second option is similar but replaces the hotel with additional residential units. This option is
referred to as the No Hotel Scenario. The No Hotel Scenario would remove the 206 existing garden
apartment units and construct up to 1,319 dwelling units including approximately 49 live/work units
(residences that provide for offices, artist studios or incubator businesses). This results in a total of up
to 1,522 units onsite when including the existing Capitol Towers building (203 units), resulting in an
average density across the project site of approximately 150 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The No
Hotel Scenario would also include the addition of up to 65,122 square feet of neighborhood-serving
retail or support space (including the existing 4,122 square feet of retail uses within Capitol Towers)
located at street level.

A graphic summarizing a description of the proposed project with and without the hotel is shown in
Figure 1.


1.2        Study Area
The project site is located in the City of Sacramento’s Central Business District and is generally
bounded by 5th, 7th, N, and P Streets. It is located within the boundaries of the Central City
Community Plan Area2. A mix of high-density residential and office complexes are located in the
immediate vicinity. Surrounding land uses include federal and state offices to the north, west, and east.
Two multi-family properties (Governor’s Square and Pioneer House) are located at the southeast and
northwest corners of 5th and P Streets, respectively. In addition, the State of California Central Plant is
located on the south side of P Street, across from the project site.

A preliminary assessment of the proposed project’s traffic volume—hereinafter referred to as “project
traffic”—was performed to define the scope of the transportation impact study. In summary, study
intersections were selected based on anticipated volume of project traffic, the distributional patterns of
project traffic, and the facilities susceptible to being impacted by the proposed project. Table 1
provides a list of study intersections and a summary of the type of intersection traffic control present.
Figure 2 illustrates the locations of the study intersection relative to the project site.

2          ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This section describes the environmental setting, which is the baseline scenario upon which project-
specific impacts are evaluated. The Existing Conditions scenario’s roadway, transit, bicycle and
pedestrian transportation systems within the study area are described below.


2.1        Roadway Network
Table 2 shows characteristics of the existing roadway network for the primary roads providing access
to the proposed project. These roads are all located in the downtown area of Sacramento and primarily
provide access to residential and office buildings. They also provide access to nearby freeway facilities
including Interstate 5 and State Route 99. The information presented in this table is based on aerial
photography, Google Street View, and a field review performed on April 24, 2014.

On-Street Parking
Most of the neighborhood streets surrounding the project site provide on-street parking. The on-street
parking surrounding the site is generally restricted on weekdays to no parking, one hour, or two-hours
unless the vehicle has a resident parking permit. Figure 3 shows the parking inventory within the
project vicinity prepared by the City of Sacramento3. As shown in this figure, there are approximately
411 on-street parking spaces located within an eighth of a mile of the proposed project’s center and
about 3,356 located within a quarter mile.

2.2      Transit Service
The Sacramento Regional Transit District (RT) provides several routes that run adjacent to the project
site including bus and light rail service. The nearest light rail station is located 1 block east of the
project site at 8th Street and O Street and is served by all three light rail lines (Blue, Gold, and Green).
Located in downtown Sacramento, the site is also served by many of the downtown RT bus routes.
Table 3 provides details of the RT Routes near the project site.

Existing and proposed bicycle and pedestrian facilities within the vicinity of the proposed project, as
documented in the 2010 City/County Bikeway Master Plan, are shown in Figure 5. The labels on
Figure 5 correspond to the project name associated with each pedestrian or bicycle facility.

According to the 2010 Master Plan, N Street will provide a primary east-west bicycle and pedestrian
connection between the Sacramento River and the Capitol with wide sidewalks. Similarly, the Capitol
Mall provides an east-west connection for bicycles via a Class II bicycle lane. North-south bicycle
access is provided via a Class II bicycle lane on 5th Street (northbound) and 9th Street (southbound).

no traffic growth between May 2013 and April 2014. Therefore, the DEIR turn movement counts are
still applicable for this project.

Figure 6 illustrates the vehicle volumes, lane configurations, and intersection control types for 13 study
intersections under Existing Conditions. The remaining seven study intersections are project-specific
intersections (access driveways) and will be analyzed under the Existing Plus Project scenarios.

Based on existing vehicle volumes, lane configurations, and intersection control types, a Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 analysis was performed. This type of analysis is based on the concept of
level of service (LOS) and delay to motorists at intersections. Table 5 shows the intersection LOS
criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersection according to the HCM 2010.

                     Table 5: Intersection LOS Criteria from the Highway Capacity Manual 2010


            Average Delay (sec/veh)

LOS        Signalized      Unsignalized                                     Description
                                           Very Low Delay: This occurs when progression is extremely favorable and
  A          < 10.0            < 10.0
                                           most vehicles arrive during a green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all.

                                         Minimal Delays: This generally occurs with good progression, short cycle
  B       >10.0 & <20.0    >10.0 & <15.0 lengths, or both. More vehicles stop than at LOS A, causing higher levels of
                                         average delay.

                                         Acceptable Delay: Delay increases due to only fair progression, longer cycle
                                         lengths, or both. Individual cycle failures (to service all waiting vehicles)
  C       >20.0 & <35.0    >15.0 & <25.0 may begin to appear at this level of service. The number of vehicles
                                         stopping is significant, though many still pass through the intersection
                                         without stopping.

                                         Approaching Unstable/Tolerable Delays: The influence of congestion
                                         becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination
  D       >35.0 & <55.0    >25.0 & <35.0 of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high v/c ratios. Many
                                         vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines.
                                         Individual cycle failures are noticeable.

                                         Unstable Operation/Significant Delays: These high delay values generally
  E       >55.0 & <80.0    >35.0 & <50.0 indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Individual
                                         cycle failures are frequent occurrences.

                                           Excessive Delays: This level, considered to be unacceptable to most drivers,
                                           often occurs with oversaturation (i.e., when arrival flow rates exceed the
  F           >80.0            >50.0       capacity of the intersection). It may also occur at high v/c ratios below 1.00
                                           with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths
                                           may also be major contributing causes to such delay levels.

The results of the Existing Conditions analysis are shown in Table 6. Analysis worksheets are included
in Appendix B. As this table shows, each of the study intersections has an overall level-of-service
(LOS) of LOS B or better. The LOS for the worst approach was found to be LOS C or better for the
unsignalized intersections. For the analysis purposes, the overall LOS determines the project impacts.

3          REGULATORY SETTING
This traffic impact analysis was conducted in accordance with the following documents:

          The Interim Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines published by the City of Sacramento in
           February 1996. This document is hereinafter referred to as the “TIA Guidelines”.

          The City of Sacramento’s 2030 General Plan: Mobility Element (2009). In addition, the
           Central City Community Plan, a component of the General Plan’s Part III.

          The 2010 Sacramento City/County Bicycle Master Plan (Amended April 2011)

          The City of Sacramento’s Pedestrian Master Plan (2006).


3.1        Federal and State
Under California Senate Bill 375, projects that are determined to be consistent with the Sustainable
Communities Strategy (SCS) and meet the definition of a Transit Priority Project (TPP) are granted
certain CEQA streamlining benefits. The proposed project qualifies as a TPP pursuant to Public


                                                                                                                      Oakland, California

Resource Code section 21155(b)5 and, based on the MTP/SCS Consistency Determination Worksheet
prepared by City staff, SACOG submitted a letter concluding the proposed project is consistent with
the SCS on June 4, 2014. As a TPP consistent with the SCS, the project is not required to discuss
growth inducing impacts, or any project-specific or cumulative impacts from cars and light-duty truck
trips on global warming, or on the regional transportation network. (Pub. Resources Code, §
21159.28(a).) In this context, the “regional transportation network” means roadways that are of
importance at a state level6.


3.2      Local
The Mobility Element of the City of Sacramento’s 2030 General Plan outlines goals and policies that
coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses. The following level of
service policy is relevant to this study:

M 1.2.2      The City shall allow for flexible Level of Service (LOS) standards, which will permit
             increased densities and mix of uses to increase transit ridership, biking, and walking, which
             decreases auto travel, thereby reducing air pollution, energy consumption, and greenhouse
             gas emissions.
             a. Core Area Level of Service Exemption—LOS F conditions are acceptable during peak
                hours in the Core Area bounded by C Street, the Sacramento River, 30th Street, and X
                Street. If a Traffic Study is prepared and identifies a LOS impact that would otherwise
                be considered significant to a roadway or intersection that is in the Core Area as
                described above, the project would not be required in that particular instance to widen
                roadways in order for the City to find project conformance with the General Plan.
                Instead, General Plan conformance could still be found if the project provides
                improvements to other parts of the citywide transportation system in order to improve
                transportation-system-wide roadway capacity, to make intersection improvements, or to
                enhance non-auto travel modes in furtherance of the General Plan goals. The
                improvements would be required within the project site vicinity or within the area
                affected by the project’s vehicular traffic impacts. With the provision of such other
                transportation infrastructure improvements, the project would not be required to
                provide any mitigation for vehicular traffic impacts to road segments in order to
5
  A TPP is a project that: (1) contains at least 50 percent residential use, based on total building square footage and, if
the project contains between 26 percent and 50 percent nonresidential uses, a floor area ratio of not less than 0.75;
(2) provide a minimum net density of at least 20 dwelling units per acre; and (3) is located within one-half mile of a
major transit stop or high-quality transit corridor included in a regional transportation plan. (Pub. Resources Code, §
21155(b).)

  Specifically, Public Resources Code section 21159.28(c) defines the “regional transportation network” to include “all
existing and proposed transportation system improvements, including the state transportation system, that were
included in the transportation and air quality conformity modeling, including congestion modeling, for the final
regional transportation plan adopted by the metropolitan planning organization, but shall not include local streets
and roads.” (See also 2030 General Plan, Figure M 2B [identifying street classifications in Sacramento’s Core Area];
California Dept. of Transportation, California Road System Maps, Maps 6J35, 7J21, and 7J31 [identifying street
classifications recognized by the State in the Downtown Sacramento area].)
                                                                                                           Oakland, California

                 conform to the General Plan. This exemption does not affect the implementation of
                 previously approved roadway and intersection improvements identified for the
                 Railyards or River District planning areas.
The Mobility Element of the City of Sacramento’s 2030 General Plan also includes the following
policies related to connectivity, walking, biking, transit, and parking that are relevant to this study:
M 1.3.1      The City shall require all new residential, commercial, or mixed-use development that
             proposes or is required to construct or extend streets to develop a transportation network
             that provides for a well-connected, walkable community, preferably in a grid or modified
             grid.
M 2.1.1      The City shall maintain and implement a Pedestrian Master Plan that carries out the goals
             and policies of the General Plan and defines: the type and location of pedestrian-oriented
             streets and pathways; standards for sidewalk width, improvements, amenities, and street
             crossings; the schedule for public improvements; and developer responsibilities. All new
             development shall be consistent with the provisions of the Pedestrian Master Plan.
M 2.1.5      The City shall provide a continuous pedestrian network in existing and new neighborhoods
             that facilitates convenient pedestrian travel free of major impediments and obstacles.
M 3.1.1      The City shall support a well-designed transit system that meets the transportation needs of
             Sacramento residents and visitors including seniors, the disabled, and transit-dependent
             persons. The City shall enhance bicycle and pedestrian access to stations.
M 4.3.1      The City shall continue wherever possible to design streets and improve development
             applications in such a manner as to reduce high traffic flows and parking problems within
             residential neighborhoods.
M 5.1.1      All proposed bikeway facilities shall be consistent with the applicable provisions of the
             Bikeway Master Plan.
M 5.1.2      All proposed bikeway facilities are appropriate to the street classifications and types, traffic
             volume, and speed on applicable rights-of-way.
M 5.1.4      The proposed project shall not result in conflicts between bicyclists and motor vehicles on
             streets, and bicyclists and pedestrians on multi-use trails and sidewalks.
M 6.1.1      The City shall ensure that appropriate parking is provided, considering access to existing
             and funded transit, shared parking opportunities for mixed-use development, and
             implementation of Transportation Demand Management plans.
The City of Sacramento Pedestrian Master Plan (2006) provides a comprehensive vision for improving
pedestrian conditions. The purpose is to make Sacramento a model pedestrian-friendly city – the
“Walking Capital.” The goals of the plan fall into the following three categories:

       Create a walkable pedestrian environment throughout the city;
       Improve awareness of the pedestrian mode through education; and
       Increase pedestrian safety.
                                                                                               Oakland, California

The 2010 Sacramento City/County Bicycle Master Plan (Amended 2011) is a joint document between
Sacramento County and the City of Sacramento. It identifies existing and proposed bicycle facilities
and improvements as well as goals and policies related to bicycling. The overarching purpose of the
improvements, policies and programs identified in the document is to enhance the safety, comfort,
convenience and experience of bicycling for the full range of potential bicyclists. The goals and
supporting policies are organized into the following categories:

         Increase bicycle use;
         Reduce bicycle collisions and injuries;
         Increase total number of bicycle facilities; and
         Ensure proportionate funding for bicycle facilities and improvements.


4         TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The potential transportation-related impacts of the proposed project are based on applicable
significance criteria. Mitigation measures necessary to reduce the significant impacts are also
identified. Impact analysis was performed for the Existing Plus Project conditions for the Hotel
Scenario and No Hotel Scenario and compared to Existing Conditions. Similarly, an impact analysis
was performed for the Cumulative Plus Project for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel Scenario by
comparing the results from those scenarios to the Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions analysis
results.


4.1       Significance Criteria
In accordance with CEQA, the effects of a project are evaluated to determine if they will result in a
significant adverse impact on the environment. For the purposes of this analysis, an impact is
considered significant if the proposed project would have the effects described below. The standards of
significance in this analysis are based upon the current practice of the City of Sacramento which
reflects the adopted LOS policies of the 2030 General Plan and the 1996 TIA Guidelines.

Intersections
General Plan Mobility Element Policy M 1.2.2 sets the definitions for what is considered an acceptable
level of service. The Core Area LOS Exemption is appropriate for the proposed project since it is
located within the core area as defined in the 2030 General Plan M 1.2.2 section. Therefore, LOS F is
acceptable during the peak hours, provided that the project provides improvements to other citywide
transportation systems within the project vicinity. Thus, if the project was to worsen operations at an
intersection operating at LOS F or worsens an intersection to LOS F, this conclusion is noted and then
a supplemental evaluation of whether the project provides improvements to other parts of the citywide
transportation system is initiated.

As reference, the criteria used to determine impacts outside of the core area are as follows:


                                                                                            Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                 15604.105
July 31, 2014                                                                                        Page 19


       The traffic generated by the project degrades peak hour level of service (LOS) from an
        acceptable LOS without the project to an unacceptable LOS with the project, or

       The LOS (without project) is unacceptable and project generated traffic increases the peak hour
        vehicle delay by five (5) seconds or more.

The overall intersection LOS is based on the average intersection delay for signalized and all-way stop
controlled intersections and for side-street stop-controlled intersections per the City of Sacramento TIA
Guidelines.

Transit Service
Impacts to the transit system are considered significant if the project would:
       Fail to adequately provide access to transit; or
       Adversely affect public transit operations.

Bicycle Facilities
Impacts to bicycle facilities are considered significant if the project would:

       Adversely affect existing or planned bicycle facilities; or

       Fail to adequately provide for access by bicycle.

Pedestrian Circulation
Impacts to pedestrian circulation are considered significant if the project would:

       Adversely affect existing or planned pedestrian facilities; or

       Fail to adequately provide for access by pedestrians.

Construction-Related Impacts
The project would have a temporarily significant impact during construction if it would:
    •   Degrade an intersection or roadway to an unacceptable level;
    •   Cause inconveniences to motorists due to prolonged road closures; or
       Result in increased frequency of potential conflicts between vehicles, pedestrians, and
        bicyclists.

4.2     Analysis Methodology

Intersections
The most recent version of the Highway Capacity Manual (2010), as implemented by the Synchro 8
traffic analysis software, was used to determine automobile delay and level of service (LOS) at the
study intersections. For unsignalized intersections both the average and worst approach delay and LOS
are reported.

For Existing Conditions (2014) analyses, current signal timings are used in conjunction with field-
collected pedestrian volumes, and bicycle volumes. For Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions and
Cumulative 2035 Plus Project analyses, current signal timings are assumed to still be in use.

The most recent California version of the Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA MUTCD
2012) was used to determine whether unsignalized intersections meet the peak hour signal warrant.
Non-signalized intersections shown to trigger the peak hour (Warrant 3) MUTCD signal warrant are
highlighted in this analysis for discussion purposes. However, the decision to install a traffic signal
should not be based solely upon a single warrant. Delay, congestion, driver confusion, future land use
or other evidence for right of way assignment beyond that provided by stop controls must be
demonstrated.

Warrant 3 addresses peak hour traffic volume levels above which a traffic signal may be warranted.
The satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant shall not in itself require the installation of a traffic control
signal according to the California MUTCD. If installed, traffic signals tend to reduce the potential for
right-angle type collisions but also tend to increase the potential for less severe rear-end collisions.
Signal warrant peak hour volumes represent the threshold point at which the potential for more rear-
end collisions is offset by the potential for fewer more severe right-angle collisions. The data needed to
perform these warrant analyses were the peak hour traffic counts described in Section 2.4.


4.3     Trip Generation
Trip generation for Sacramento Commons is based on information complied by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, 2012 and Trip Generation Manual
User’s Guide and Handbook, 9th Edition, 2012), the travel mode shares from the travel survey at the
existing Capitol Towers apartment building (conducted in February 2008 and March 2008 at the site),
and the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report: Analysis of the 2000 SACOG House Travel Survey (DKS,
2001).

Travel Behavior at Existing Capitol Towers Apartments
The February/March 2008 Capitol Towers Travel Survey was a voluntary survey that residents of
Capitol Towers participated in. The survey had participants record all trips they took on the most
recent weekday between 6:00 to 9:00 AM and 4:00 to 6:00 PM. Forms were filled out for each member
of the household. Trip characteristics that were recorded include information such as departure and

                                                                                               Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                    15604.105
July 31, 2014                                                                                           Page 21


arrival times, mode of transportation (e.g., walk, walk to transit, car, bike), trip purpose, destination,
and number of times the trip is typically made during the work week (i.e., Monday through Friday).
From this information, the transit and walk shares for the Capitol Towers were calculated for the
weekday a.m. and p.m. peak periods. This travel survey is still valid today because the downtown area
still has a similar set of land uses and the transit options remain unchanged. Appendix C contains a
summary of the travel survey.

2000 SACOG Household Travel Survey
The 2000 SACOG Household Survey was a detailed survey conducted in Spring 2000 of the entire
Sacramento region. The trip generation memorandum submitted by Kittelson & Associates, Inc. to the
City of Sacramento as part of this study details how the SACOG Household Travel Survey was used to
calculate adjustments for non-auto mode choice to the trip generation. The trip generation
memorandum is included as Appendix D.

ITE Trip Generation and Land Use Assumptions
Kittelson & Associates calculated trip generation estimates for two proposed land use scenarios. As
noted above, the Hotel Scenario includes a 320-room hotel, 100 fewer residential units (1,422
compared to 1,522), and an additional 4,000 square feet of retail compared to the No Hotel Scenario
(69,122 square feet compared to 65,122 square feet). Both scenarios include replacing the 206 low-rise
garden apartments while maintaining the existing Capitol Towers building that consists of 203 high-
rise apartments and 4,122 square feet of retail space. The following summarizes the land uses used
from the ITE Trip Generation Manual to estimate the initial automobile trips for the proposed project.

       Neighborhood Support/Retail (Parcel 1, 2A, 2B, 3 and 4A in Figure 1): ITE Trip
        Generation Land Use 820 for a shopping center; it is a conservative estimate given that specific
        types of retail is not known at this time.

       High-Rise Apartments (Parcel 1 and Parcel 3 in Figure 1): ITE Trip Generation Land Use
        222, which is applicable to apartments in buildings with more than ten levels.

       Mid-Rise Apartments (Parcel 2A, 2B and 4B in Figure 1): ITE Trip Generation Land Use
        223, which is applicable to apartments in buildings that have between three and ten levels. The
        ITE Trip Generation Manual does not include a weekday daily trip estimate for mid-rise
        apartments; therefore, to estimate the daily trips for the mid-rise apartments, ITE Trip
        Generation Land Use 221 for low-rise apartments was used. The low-rise apartment land use
        provides a more conservative estimate for daily trips than the high-rise apartment land use.

       Live-Work Units (Parcel 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4B in Figure 1): Live-work units were included as
        part of the residential trip generation numbers. These units are expected to house artists or
        incubator businesses where the decrease in trips due to residents working at home is expected
        to be similar to the number of clients visiting the unit. Therefore, trip generation for these units
        can be accounted for using the residential land use category.
                                                                                              Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                   15604.105

       Hotel (Parcel 3 in Figure 1 for the Hotel Scenario): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 310
        directly applicable to hotels providing sleeping accommodations and supporting facilities (e.g.,
        restaurants, retail, service shops).

The total automobile trip generation estimates for the proposed project were calculated as the
automobile trips generated by the proposed project minus the existing trips generated by the existing
land uses to be replaced at the project site. The following section discusses the trip generation
adjustments made to account for transit use, walking, biking and internal trips.

Trip Generation Adjustments
Adjustments were applied to the ITE trip generation rates to account for:

       High transit ridership;
       High levels of walking and bicycle use within the highly urbanized project setting; and
       The interaction of travel among the mixture of land uses within the proposed project.
Details on these adjustments can be found in the Capitol Towers survey data included as Appendix C
and the trip generation memorandum included as Appendix D. The rest of this section provides only an
overview of the adjustment process.

Adjustments for Transit Trips
The transit trip reduction for the retail component of the proposed project was assumed to be 2.2
percent of the total number of trips based on transit shares from the Pre-Census Travel Behavior
Report for Downtown and Sacramento for work-trips and non-work trips, assuming seven percent of
retail trips would be employees making work trips.

The transit trip reduction for the residential component of the proposed project was assumed to be 4.9
percent of the total number of daily trips, 4.2% for a.m. peak hour, and 5.3% for the p.m. peak hour. As
described in the section above, these are based on the transit shares from the Capitol Towers Travel
Survey (see Appendix C).

Trip Adjustments for Walk, Bike, and Other Non-Auto Travel
A similar process was used to develop adjustments for higher use of walk, bike, and other non-auto
travel (hereinafter referred to as “walk trips”). The walk trip reduction for the retail component of the
proposed project was assumed to be 11.6 percent of the total number of trips, based on data from the
Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report.

The walk trip reduction for the residential component of the proposed project was assumed to be 38.9
percent of the total number of daily trips (the walk trip reduction was 40 percent during the a.m. peak
hour and 38.8 percent during the p.m. peak hour). These adjustments to residential trips were based on
the differences between walk shares from the survey of Capitol Towers residents and the walk shares

                                                                                             Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                                 15604.105
July 31, 2014                                                                                                        Page 23


from the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report. The walk share of total daily trips from the Capitol
Towers Travel Survey was assumed to be 44.5 percent (the average of the 45 percent AM walk share
and the 44 percent PM peak hour walk share).

Internal Trip Adjustments
After the adjustments were made for transit, walk, bike, and other non-auto travel, an adjustment was
made to account for internal trips between different types of land uses within each parcel within the
proposed project. The internal trip adjustments were performed using procedures recommended by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers for multi-use developments (Trip Generation Handbook, 2012).
Internal trips are trips that would occur between different land uses within the same site without
accessing the street system. The worksheets in Appendix C titled “Trips Among All Parcels”
summarize these trip calculations.

The project is expected to have a minimal amount of vehicle pass-by trips7. Given the small number of
these trip types, no pass-by trips were assumed for retail uses in the analysis in order to provide a more
conservative analysis.

Table 7 and Table 8 summarize the automobile trip generation results for the Hotel Scenario and No
Hotel Scenario, respectively. Detailed, parcel-by-parcel summary and worksheet calculations are
contained in Appendix C.

Table 9 and Table 10 present the net new transit trip generation for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel
Scenario, respectively. See Appendix C.

 A pass-by trip is a project trip that is already on the streets adjacent to the project prior to construction. These trips
will visit the project site but will only impact project driveways and not nearby intersections since they are already
accounted for in traffic data collected for existing conditions.

4.4     Trip Distribution and Assignment
The expected distribution of vehicle trips associated with the proposed project in the study area was
derived from the SACMET travel demand model, the layout of the proposed site, and the proposed
driveway access locations. The land use for the traffic model zones, within which the proposed project
is located, was altered to better define the proposed project’s land use. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the
Project Only volumes at the study intersections for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel Scenario,
respectively.

Figure 7 shows the AM and PM peak hour trip distribution percentages for project trips within the City
of Sacramento. Trip distribution percentages for both the hotel option and no hotel option were found
to be similar. This is due to the one-way street network in Downtown Sacramento that limits the
number of different routes motorists can choose from. Therefore, Figure 7 is representative of both
scenarios.

The plus project volumes (shown in Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 13, and Figure 14) do consider
changes in background traffic as well as the project trips obtained from the distribution of the trip
generation results.

Raw model plots for trip distribution/assignment are contained in Appendix E.

4.5     Existing Plus Project
The Existing Plus Project condition analyzes the impact of adding project traffic to the Existing
Conditions. The traffic analysis results for the Existing Plus Project condition are compared with the
Existing Conditions to determine if the proposed project has no impact, less than significant impact,
significant but avoidable impact with mitigation, or significant and unavoidable proposed project
impacts.

Intersections
The Existing Plus Project traffic analysis indicates how the study area’s transportation system will
operate with the traffic generated by the proposed project. The AM and PM project trips (shown in
Figure 8 and Figure 9 for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel Scenario, respectively) were added to the
Existing Conditions volumes. The total traffic volumes for the Existing Plus Project condition are
shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel Scenario, respectively.

Level-of-service results for Existing Plus Project scenarios are shown in Table 11 and Table 12 for the
AM and PM peak hours, respectively. As shown in these tables, each study intersection would continue
to operate at overall LOS C or better with the addition of project traffic to the study intersections.
Analysis worksheets for these scenarios are included in Appendix F.

In addition to an LOS analysis, each unsignalized study intersection were assessed in the Existing
Conditions and Existing Plus Project conditions to determine if they met the peak hour signal warrant
as described in the 2012 California MUTCD. None of the unsignalized study intersections meet the
peak hour signal warrant under Existing Conditions or the Existing Plus Project scenarios in the AM or
PM peak hour as shown in Table 13. Full documentation of these findings is provided in Appendix I.

Transit Operations
The anticipated transit trips that the proposed project will generate for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel
Scenario are shown in Table 9 and Table 10, respectively. As these tables show, the proposed project
will generate between 20 and 30 transit trips in the AM peak hour and 40 to 50 transit trips in the PM
peak hour. With 14 transit lines near the project site, each running multiple transit vehicles in the peak
hours, the proposed project adequately provides access to transit. A total of 26 bus stops and four light
rail stops are located within a quarter mile of the center of the project site.

Bicycle and Pedestrians
The proposed project is expected to generate more than 8,000 vehicle trips and 4,000 walk, bike, and
other non-vehicle trips during a typical weekday as shown in the trip generation tables (Table 7 and
Table 8). This increase in trips has the potential to increase the number of pedestrian/bicycle,
pedestrian/motor vehicle, and bicycle/motor vehicle conflicts.


                                                                                                          Oakland, California

The site plan design and overall proposed project is intended to be pedestrian friendly and oriented. As
such, it is supportive of the policies and goals in the 2006 Pedestrian Master Plan that identifies this
area as a pedestrian street corridor with a wide sidewalk/bike lane present on N Street adjacent to the
project site.

4.6     Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions
Traffic volumes for the Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions scenario were developed to reflect
changes in the regional transportation network and socio-demographic land use data between the
Existing Conditions year (2014) and the Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions year (2035), as
presented below. Figure 12 shows the Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions AM and PM peak hour
vehicle trips developed by the model.

Land Use and Transportation System Assumptions
The cumulative version of the SACMET model accounts for planned land use growth within the City
of Sacramento according to the City’s General Plan, as well as growth in the surrounding region.

The SACMET model also accounts for planned improvements to the surrounding transportation
system, and incorporates the current Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) and Metropolitan
Transportation Plan (MTP) for the Sacramento region. The version of the model used to develop the
Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions scenario was modified by Fehr & Peers in 2013 to include the
most recent planned land uses and transportation projects within the City of Sacramento, including the
Entertainment and Sports Center (ESC). Table 14 presents a summary of the ESC increase in land uses
(by type) over the SACMET base year land uses.

The cumulative analysis also assumes a variety of reasonably foreseeable planned roadway
improvements included in the MTP in the proposed project’s vicinity including:

       The reduction of the Tower Bridge from four to two lanes to accommodate a streetcar;
       I Street Bridge Replacement over the Sacramento River to new location slightly to the north;
       South Market Crossing Bridge (south of Pioneer Bridge) over the Sacramento River;
       Truxel Road Bridge over the American River;
       Carpool high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on I-5 from the US 50/Capital City Freeway to I-
        80;
       3rd Street Conversion Project - converts 3rd Street to two-way operations between Capitol
        Mall and L Street;
       I-5 Riverfront Reconnection Project (consisting of removal of the slip ramp from L Street/3rd
        Street to westbound Capitol Mall/Tower Bridge, and a new at-grade signalized intersection on
        Capitol Mall at Front Street/2nd Street);
       Extensions of 5th Street and 6th Street, Railyards Boulevard, and Bercut Drive into the
        Railyards Specific Plan area; and
       Sutter’s Land Parkway interchange on the Capital City Freeway, including its extension to SR
        160/Richards Boulevard/16th Street.

Various off-model adjustments were performed to modify the City’s travel model output to be suitable
for operational analysis.

The City’s General Plan calls for an increase in residential housing density from approximately 40
units per acre to at least 61 units per acre in the vicinity of the Project by 2035. This growth is
accounted for in the Cumulative 2035 SACMET model but the exact location of where the growth will
occur is unknown. Therefore, the Cumulative Plus Project scenario assumed all growth would occur
outside of the project site. This is a more conservative analysis since it is likely some of project growth
was already accounted for in the City’s General Plan.

Traffic volumes for the Plus Project scenarios were obtained by using five new traffic analysis zones
(TAZs) to reflect the Project’s parcels. The peak hour trips exiting and entering these TAZs were
factored to match the adjusted ITE trip rates presented in Table 7 and Table 8. Finally, the project-only
turning movements at the study intersections were added to the Existing Conditions and Cumulative
2035 No Project Conditions volumes to produce Existing Plus Project and Cumulative 2035 Plus
Project scenarios, respectively. The process described above was performed separately for the Hotel
and No Hotel scenarios.

The Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions volumes were analyzed using the Synchro traffic analysis
program to determine LOS in the AM and PM peak hours. The results of the Cumulative 2035 No
Project Conditions LOS analysis are documented in Table 15. Analysis worksheets are presented in
Appendix G.

As Table 15 shows, all intersections would operate at overall LOS C or better in the Cumulative 2035
No Project Conditions scenario. Two intersections, 6th Street/P Street & 6th Street/Q Street, meet the
peak hour signal warrant in the Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions scenario (this is shown further
below in Table 18).

4.7     Cumulative 2035 Plus Project Scenarios
Under Cumulative 2035 Plus Project scenarios, the SACMET model land use at the project site was
replaced with the Project’s land use to analyze the impact of project traffic on Cumulative 2035 No
Project Conditions. The traffic analysis results for the Cumulative 2035 Plus Project scenarios are
compared with the Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions to determine if the proposed project results
in any significant impacts.

Intersections
The Cumulative 2035 Plus Project scenarios analysis allows a determination of how the study area’s
transportation system will operate with the traffic generated by the proposed project. The AM and PM
project trips (shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel Scenario,
respectively) were added to the Cumulative 2035 No Project Conditions volumes to arrive at the total
traffic volumes. The total traffic volumes for the Cumulative 2035 Plus Project condition are shown in
Figure 13 and Figure 14 for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel Scenario, respectively.

Control delays for unsignalized (TWSC) intersections are presented as follows: Average (Worst Approach)
Gray-shaded cells indicate intersections that are only present in Plus Project conditions.
* O Street between 7th and 9th Streets is one-way eastbound, therefore, there is no intersection delay at 7th Street and O Street.

In addition to LOS analysis, each unsignalized intersection was assessed in the Cumulative 2035 No
Project Conditions and Cumulative 2035 Plus Project scenarios for whether the peak hour signal
warrant is met as described in the 2012 California MUTCD. As Table 18 shows, the intersection of 6th
Street & Q Street meets the peak hour signal warrant in the AM peak hour for all cumulative scenarios.
The 6th Street and P Street intersection also meets the peak hour signal warrant in the PM peak hour for
all cumulative scenarios. Full documentation of these signal warrant findings is provided in Appendix
I.

Transit Operations
The anticipated transit trips that the proposed project will generate for both the Hotel Scenario and No
Hotel Scenario are shown in Table 9 and Table 10, respectively. As these tables show, the proposed
project will generate between 20 and 30 transit trips in the AM peak hour and 40 to 50 transit trips in
the PM peak hour. A total of 26 bus stops and four light rail stops are located within a quarter mile of
the center of the project site. With 14 transit lines near the project site, each running multiple transit
vehicles in the peak hours, the proposed project adequately provides access to transit.

Bicycle and Pedestrians
The proposed project is expected to generate more than 8,000 vehicle trips and 4,000 walk, bike, and
other non-vehicle trips during a typical weekday as shown in the trip generation tables (Table 7 and
Table 8). This increase in trips has the potential to increase the number of pedestrian/bicycle,
pedestrian/motor vehicle, and bicycle/motor vehicle conflicts.

The site plan design and overall proposed project is intended to be pedestrian friendly and oriented. As
such, it is supportive of the policies and goals in the 2006 Pedestrian Master Plan that identifies this
area as a pedestrian street corridor with a wide sidewalk/bike lane present on N Street adjacent to the
project site.

4.8     Impacts and Mitigation Measures
This section describes the transportation impacts of the project for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel
Scenario. Mitigation measures are identified for significant impacts. These measures are applicable to
the project, can be feasibly implemented, and are hereby incorporated into this traffic impact analysis
as a requirement of the project.

Existing Conditions
This section describes the project-specific transportation impacts under the Existing Conditions
scenario.

Impact 1: Under Existing Conditions, project buildout could cause potentially significant impacts
to study intersections.

        According to the significance criteria and intersection LOS results (shown in Table 6 and Table
        5), all study intersections would continue to operate at an acceptable level of service under
        Existing Plus Project conditions for both the Hotel and No Hotel scenarios in the AM and PM
        peak hour. Therefore, this is considered a Less than Significant impact.

        Mitigation Measure

        None Required.


Impact 2: Under Existing Conditions, project buildout could cause potentially significant impacts
to transit service and facilities.

        The proposed project’s residents, visitors, and patrons would be provided adequate walking
        facilities to access transit services. Additionally, the proposed project would not adversely
        affect public transit operations for both the Hotel and No Hotel scenarios. Therefore, the
        impact of the proposed project on the transit system is considered Less than Significant.


        Mitigation Measure

        None Required.

Impact 3: Under Existing Conditions, project buildout could cause potentially significant impacts
to bicycle access and facilities.

        The proposed project would result in an increase in vehicle and bicycle trips in the study area
        by residents and retail patrons. The proposed project driveways would also increase the number
        of potential conflict points between vehicles and bicyclists, especially along 5th Street where an
        existing Class II bike lane exists.



                                                                                            Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                  15604.105
July 31, 2014                                                                                         Page 54


        The proposed project will be conditioned to design the project frontage and all access points
        within the proposed site in accordance to the City’s driveway standards subject to review and
        approval of City Department of Public Works. Furthermore, it is not anticipated to hinder or
        eliminate the existing bikeways or interfere with the implementation of the planned bikeways
        in the study area. Therefore, the impact of the proposed project is considered Less than
        Significant.

        Mitigation Measure

        None Required.


Impact 4. Under Existing Conditions, project buildout could cause potentially significant impacts to
pedestrian access and facilities.

        The proposed project would result in an increase in vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian trips in the
        study area by residents and retail patrons, which may lead to the increased potential for
        pedestrian/bicycle or pedestrian/motor vehicle conflicts. The proposed project will be
        conditioned to design the project frontage and all access points within the proposed site in
        accordance to the City’s “Pedestrian Friendly Street Standards” and subject to review and
        approval of City Department of Public Works. Therefore, the impact of the proposed project is
        considered Less than Significant.


        Mitigation Measure

        None Required.


Impact 5. Under Existing Conditions, project buildout could cause potentially significant impacts due
to construction-related activities.

        The effects of demolition/construction and related truck traffic could adversely affect existing
        motorists, bicycle, pedestrian or transit facilities. Therefore, the impacts would be considered
        potentially significant.

        Mitigation Measure
        Before issuance of demolition permit and beginning of construction for the project site, the
        project applicant shall prepare a Traffic Management Plan consistent with the requirements of
        sections 12.20.020 and 12.20.030 of the Sacramento Municipal Code that will be subject to
        review and approval by the City Department of Public Works, in consultation with Caltrans,
        affected transit providers, and local emergency service providers including the City of
        Sacramento Fire and Police departments. The plan shall ensure maintenance of acceptable
        operating conditions on local roadways and transit routes. In consideration of the number and
        type of trucks proposed to be used during construction, the proposed location of staging areas,

                                                                                            Oakland, California

        •    Require the installation of temporary traffic control devices as specified in the California
             Department of Transportation Manual of Traffic Controls for Construction and
             Maintenance Work Zones.
        •    Require construction truck trips to occur outside of peak morning and evening commute
             hours.
        •    Limit the number of lane closures associated with project construction during peak hours.
        •    Establish construction truck routes that limit truck traffic on local roadways as defined and
             identified on Figure M 2B in the City’s 2030 General Plan.
        •    Establish pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular (including transit and emergency vehicle)
             detour routes where necessary to avoid conflicts with construction zone operations and
             traffic.
        •    Provide safe driveway access during construction for pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicles
             (including transit and emergency vehicle) through the use of steel plates, signage, and
             similar measures.
        •    Require temporary directional signage along all construction zone detour routes.

        A copy of the Traffic Management Plan as approved by City Department of Public Works shall
        be submitted to local emergency response agencies and these agencies shall be notified at least
        30 days before the commencement of construction that would partially or fully obstruct
        roadways. In addition, construction activities are not to interfere with transit service and
        pedestrian access to transit stops and light rail. With the implementation of this mitigation
        measure, the construction related impact is Less than Significant.

Cumulative 2035 Plus Project
Impact 6. Under Cumulative 2035 scenarios, the proposed project could cause potentially
significant impacts to study intersections.

        According to the significance criteria and results in Table 16 and Table 17, all study
        intersections would continue to operate at an acceptable level of service under Cumulative
        2035 Plus Project conditions for both the Hotel and No Hotel scenarios in the AM and PM
        peak hour. Installing a signal at the intersection of 6th Street & P Street adjacent to the project
        site would be considered an improvement to the overall transportation system and could be
        performed within existing right-of-way and does not require any roadway widening.

        Since this intersection is in the Core Area as defined by the General Plan Mobility Element,
        LOS F may be acceptable during peak hours provided that the project provides improvements
        to other parts of the citywide transportation system within the project site vicinity to improve
        transportation-system-wide roadway capacity, to make intersection improvements, or to


                                                                                               Oakland, California

        enhance non-auto travel modes in furtherance of the General Plan goals. With implementation
        of Mitigation Measure 6, the proposed project’s impact is considered Less than Significant.

        Mitigation Measure

        The project applicant shall construct a traffic signal at the intersection of 6 th Street and P Street
        with the Phase IV of the development as part of P Street frontage improvements for the project.


Impact 7: Under Cumulative 2035 scenarios, project buildout could cause potentially significant
impacts to transit service and facilities.

        The proposed project’s residents, visitors, and patrons would be provided adequate walking
        facilities to access transit services. Additionally, the proposed project would not adversely
        affect public transit operations for both the Hotel and No Hotel scenarios. Therefore, the
        impact of the proposed project on the transit system is considered Less than Significant.


        Mitigation Measure

        None Required.

Impact 8: Under Cumulative 2035 scenarios, project buildout could cause potentially significant
impacts to bicycle access and facilities.

        The proposed project would result in an increase in vehicle and bicycle trips in the study area
        by residents and retail patrons. The proposed project driveways would also increase the number
        of potential conflict points between vehicles and bicyclists, especially along 5 th Street where an
        existing Class II bike lane exists.

        The proposed project will be conditioned to design the project frontage and all access points
        within the proposed site in accordance to the City’s driveway standards subject to review and
        approval of City Department of Public Works. Furthermore, it is not anticipated to hinder or
        eliminate the existing bikeways or interfere with the implementation of the planned bikeways
        in the study area. Therefore, the impact of the proposed project is considered Less than
        Significant.


        Mitigation Measure

        None Required.

Impact 9. Under Cumulative 2035 scenarios, project buildout could cause potentially significant
impacts to pedestrian access and facilities.

          The proposed project would result in an increase in vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian trips in the
          study area by residents and retail patrons, which may lead to the increased potential for
          pedestrian/bicycle or pedestrian/motor vehicle conflicts. The proposed project will be
          conditioned to design the project frontage and all access points within the proposed site in
          accordance to the City’s “Pedestrian Friendly Street Standards” and subject to review and
          approval of City Department of Public Works. The installation of traffic signal at 6th Street & P
          Street with Phase IV of the development will provide additional improvement to the existing
          unsignalized pedestrian crossing on P Street and enhance pedestrian path through the project
          site. Therefore, the impact of the proposed project is considered Less than Significant.


          Mitigation Measure

          None Required.


5         OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

5.1       Proposed Project Access and On-Site Circulation
Internal circulation was qualitatively evaluated to consider the on-site circulation for pedestrian
movements and motorized traffic. Figure 15 illustrates the proposed development plan.

Vehicle access to the proposed development is mostly via one-way streets at seven right-in/right-out
driveway access points. This includes one driveway on N Street, three driveways on 7th Street, one
driveway on P Street, and two driveways on 5th Street. Given the right-in/right-out configuration of all
driveways and the LOS A traffic operations at the driveway intersections through the Cumulative 2035
Plus Project scenarios, the assumption that driveways are controlled by stop signs on the driveway
approaches (i.e., minor-street stop control) is justified.

Most of the proposed development’s driveways provide direct access to parking garages. Vehicle
circulation on the project site outside of the garages is limited to the hotel drop off accessed via
driveway 1 and the southeast corner of the proposed project served by driveways 4 and 5. The
following observations should be considered when refining the design of these two areas:

         Shrubbery and landscaping near the internal intersections and site access points should be
          maintained to ensure adequate sight distance; and
         Appropriate turning templates to accommodate vehicles expected to use the areas.

On-site circulation is similar to Existing Conditions scenario where there are open spaces that bisect
the project site. These open spaces essentially provide a non-vehicular extension of O Street in the

                                                                                             Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                    15604.105
July 31, 2014                                                                                           Page 58


east-west direction and 6th Street in the north-south direction. Figure 16 show how these open spaces
are also designed to serve as fire lanes for emergency vehicles.

Considerations to improve on-site access for all modes, as well as to accommodate emergency
vehicles, are listed below:

       All turning radii for fire access should be designed as 35’ inside and 55’ outside.
       Roads used for Fire Department access should have an unobstructed width of not less than 20’
        and unobstructed vertical clearance of 13’6” or more.
       “No Parking Fire Lane” markings should be applied on the emergency access roads. However,
        due to the pedestrian nature of the open spaces between the proposed project’s buildings, that
        striping and signage would be limited.
       Clearly define pedestrian on-site routes.
       Landscaping and shrubbery should be placed and maintained in a way that it would not grow to
        obstruct pathways.

5.2       Intersection Queuing
A review of 95th percentile queues was conducted for all Cumulative 2035 Plus Project scenarios. The
PM scenarios had considerably more queuing than the AM scenarios. Under the PM scenarios, the
following calculated queues extended to or beyond the upstream intersection which may restrict
movements at the upstream intersection.

         Northbound approach to the 5th Street & N Street intersection (#2). The 95th percentile queue is
          expected to reach the Driveway 7 intersection (#20).

         Northbound approach to the 6th Street & P Street intersection (#5). The 95th percentile queue is
          expected to reach the 6th Street & Q Street intersection (#6).

         Eastbound approach to the 7th Street & N Street intersection (#8). The 95th percentile queue is
          expected to reach the Driveway 1 intersection (#14).

         Southbound approach to the 7th Street & P Street intersection (#10). The 95th percentile queue
          is expected to reach the Driveway 4 intersection (#17).

Figure 17 presents a diagram highlighting the 95th percentile queue lengths in the PM peak hour for the
Cumulative 2035 Plus Project No Hotel Scenario. Queue lengths were similar, although slightly
shorter, for the Hotel Scenario. Therefore, Figure 17 represents the maximum queue length expected
between the two scenarios. None of these queues were found to affect upstream intersections other than
those specifically mentioned above. Therefore, the driveways are expected to operate satisfactorily at
the locations specified in the proposed project’s site plan and under minor-street stop control.

Table 19 shows the number of parking spaces in each garage. A final design of the driveways’ throat
depth and the set back of the gates will be subject to review and approval by the department of Public
Works.

                                 Table 19: Project Parking Spaces by Garage

It is recommended that the throat depth (i.e., queue storage) at the driveways be designed to
accommodate the 95th percentile queues on the driveway approaches. The length of outbound queues is
a function of outbound vehicular volume and traffic operations on the major roadway. The length of



                                                                                             Oakland, California
Sacramento Commons                                                                                               15604.105
July 31, 2014                                                                                                      Page 62


inbound queues is dictated by inbound vehicular volume and the garage gate opening time (if any is
installed).

Outbound traffic queues were calculated8 based on the outbound vehicular volume and traffic
operations on the major roadway. The following summarizes the calculated maximum outbound
queues:

        The maximum 95th percentile queue on Driveway 2 is estimated at 64 feet or about 3 vehicles.
        The maximum 95th percentile queue on Driveway 5 is estimated at 53 feet or about 2 vehicles.

        All other driveways are expected to have outbound queue lengths less than one car length.

Regarding inbound queues due to gated entries, previous studies and field observations performed for
the City of Sacramento suggest gate service times9 of approximately seven to nine seconds to serve one
vehicle, which is taken here as a deterministic (i.e., fixed) value.

To estimate the 95th percentile length of the inbound queues, the hourly inbound rates at the driveways
were adjusted upward using the same 95th Percentile Arrival Rate formula used by Synchro 810. The
adjustments ranged from 5.1 times to 8.3 times the hourly rates, corresponding to rare situations in
which 42 percent to 69 percent of the hourly volume would arrive in the same five-minute span.

Using the highest inbound rates—generally those under the Hotel Scenario, PM peak hour—and the
relationship between arrival rate, queue length, and waiting times (i.e., Little’s Law), the following
findings were derived:

        The inbound queue length at Driveway 1 under the Hotel scenario depends primarily on the
         dwell time of vehicles at the hotel loading zone. Based on a site plan review, nine vehicles can
         be accommodated without queue spillback onto N Street. If more vehicles are anticipated,
         alternate loading options need to be provided. For example, the hotel may consider offering
         valet services to quickly move vehicles to a parking garage.

        Driveway 2 (Intersection #15, off 7th Street) and Driveway 5 (Intersection #18, off P Street)
         would result in about two vehicles queued at the driveways. Using a typical 25-foot vehicle
         length, two vehicles would occupy 50 feet.

        All other proposed project driveways are expected to have single-vehicle queues waiting for
         the gate to open. Using the standard vehicle length assumption, the inbound queues would be
         25 feet long.

In summary, the location of the access gate at the parking garage would depend on the inbound traffic
and the service time at each gate which is assumed to be less than nine seconds. The following points
summarize the recommendations from this analysis.

       The Driveway 2 throat to and from the proposed Parcel 3 parking garage should be designed to
        accommodate a minimum of two vehicles (50 feet). This can either be provided linearly or by
        having additional gates to serve multiple vehicles at the same time.

       According to the current site plan, the Driveway 5 access from and to P Street has sufficient
        throat depth to accommodate the 53-foot 95th percentile outbound queue length.

       The rest of the proposed project driveways shall be constructed in strict conformance with the
        City’s driveway standards, Standard Construction Specifications, special instructions of the
        driveway inspector, and the design plans as approved by City of Sacramento Transportation
        Engineer so that no cars will be backing into the adjacent streets and blocking sidewalks.

This technical memorandum documents the trip generation calculations Kittelson & Associates, Inc.
(KAI) conducted for the Sacramento Commons proposed project.

The following documents the proposed project’s description; trip generation methodology and
assumptions; and summary of the trip generation calculation results. Appendix A contains the more
detailed parcel-by-parcel trip generation calculation worksheets. Appendix B contains information to
support the methodology and assumptions.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The description below is from the Notice of Preparation memorandum prepared for the Sacramento
Commons Project and dated April 8, 2014.

           The project includes high-rise and mid-rise apartments and condominiums, with opportunities
           for live-work and neighborhood-serving retail and support services for community residents
           and guests. Modern community amenities, pedestrian promenades, rooftop open space
           areas, and a potential hotel (described below) are other planned features of the community
           (see Figure 3, Proposed Project).

           As part of the site’s development, the project would enhance the pedestrian walkways and
           replace 206 existing garden apartment units with approximately 1,400–1,500 new dwelling
           units (including the existing 203-unit Capitol Tower high-rise) of various types and densities (a
           net increase of approximately 1,200–1,300 dwelling units), new parking structures with up to
           1,778 spaces serve uses on-site, approximately 65,000–69,000 square feet of neighborhood-
           serving retail and/or support uses, and 44,000 square feet of live-work space to activate the

           Figure 4, Parcel Diagram; and Figure 5, Land Use Summary).

           The existing 15-story Capitol Tower building, containing 203 dwelling units, would remain an
           integral part of the Sacramento Commons community. Improvements to Capitol Tower could
           include interior modifications to reconfigure apartments, senior living facilities, or
           condominiums. The building’s exterior would likely undergo a makeover to ensure overall
           architectural compatibility with Sacramento Commons.

           Two potential development options are proposed for the project parcel near the corner of N
           and 7th streets (see Figure 5, Land Use Summary). Option 1 is planned as a 22-story mixed-
           use high-rise hotel and residential condominium development that would include a lobby
           area, restaurant, hotel meeting spaces, and other supporting uses on floors 1 and 2; hotel
           rooms on floors 3 through 11; and condominium units on floors 12–22. Option 2 proposes an
           all condominium alternative, with ground floor support uses.


METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS
Trip generation for the Sacramento Commons project is based on information complied by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, 2012 and Trip Generation
Manual User’s Guide and Handbook, 9th Edition, 2012), the travel mode shares from the travel survey
at the existing Capitol Towers apartment building (conducted in February 2008 and March 2008 at
the site), and the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report: Analysis of the 2000 SACOG House Travel Survey
(DKS, 2001). Appendix B contains a summary of the travel survey conducted in February/March 2008
at the existing Capitol Towers site.

ITE Trip Generation Land Use Assumptions
KAI calculated trip generation estimates for two proposed land use options. As noted above, Option 1
includes a 320-room hotel, 100 fewer residential units, and an additional 4,000 square feet of retail
compared to Option 2. Option 1 and 2 include replacing 206 low-rise garden apartments. Option 1
and 2 also both include maintaining the existing Capitol Towers building that consists of 203 high-rise
apartments and 4,122 square feet of retail space. The following summarizes the land uses used from
the ITE Trip Generation Manual to estimate the initial automobile trips for the proposed project.

                New Neighborhood Support/Retail (noted in Parcel 1, 2A, 2B, 3 and 4A): ITE Trip
                 Generation Land Use 820 for a shopping center; a reasonable conservative estimate given
                 that specific types of retail is not known at this time.
                New high rise apartments (noted in Parcel 1 and Parcel 3): ITE Trip Generation Land Use
                 222, which is applicable to apartments in buildings with more than 10 levels.
                New mid-rise apartments (noted in Parcel 2A, 2B and 4B): ITE Trip Generation Land Use
                 223, which is applicable to apartments in buildings that have between 3 and 10 levels. The

                 ITE Trip Generation Manual does not include a weekday daily trip estimate for mid-rise
                 apartments; therefore, to estimate the daily trips for the mid-rise apartments we used,
                 ITE Trip Generation Land Use 221 for low-rise apartments. The low-rise apartment land
                 use provides a more conservative estimate for daily trips than the high-rise apartment
                 land use.
                New Hotel (noted in Option 1 for Parcel 3): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 310 directly
                 applicable to hotels providing sleeping accommodations and supporting facilities (e.g.,
                 restaurants, retail, service shops).
The total automobile trip generation estimates for the proposed project were calculated as the
automobile trips generated by the proposed new project minus the existing trips generated by the
existing land uses to be replaced at the project site. The following section discusses the trip
generation adjustments made to account for transit use, walking, biking and internal trips.

Trip Generation Adjustments
The ITE trip generation estimates are based on surveys taken primarily in suburban locations. It was
therefore necessary to adjust ITE trip generation estimates to reflect trip making expected to result
from development of the project in Downtown Sacramento. Adjustments to the ITE trip generation
estimates were made to account for:

                Higher transit ridership;
                Higher levels of walking and bicycle use within the highly urbanized project setting; and
                The interaction of travel among the mixture of land uses within the project.
Adjustments for the higher use of transit and walk, bike, and other non-auto travel for the residential
land uses proposed as part of the project were based on the travel mode shares identified in the
February/March 2008 survey of the existing Capitol Towers apartments. Adjustments for the higher
use of transit and walk, bike, and other non-auto travel for non-residential land uses were based on
information contained in the 2000 SACOG Household Travel Survey.

February/March 2008 Capitol Towers Travel Survey and 2000 SACOG Household Travel Survey
The February/March 2008 Capitol Towers Travel Survey was a voluntary survey that residents of
Capitol Towers participated in. The survey had participants record all trips they took on the most
recent weekday between 6:00 – 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 – 6:00 p.m. Forms were filled out for each
member of the household. Trip characteristics that were recorded include information such as
departure and arrival times, mode of transportation (e.g., walk, walk to transit, car, bike), trip
purpose, destination, and number of times the trip is typically made during the work week (i.e.,
Monday through Friday). From this information, the transit and walk shares for the Capitol Towers
were calculated for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak periods.

The 2000 SACOG Household Survey was a detailed survey conducted in Spring 2000 of the entire
Sacramento region. The scope of the travel survey included Sacramento, Yolo, Yuba, and Sutter

counties as well as western portions of Placer and El Dorado counties. In the 2001, the Pre-Census
Travel Behavior Report: Analysis of the 2000 SACOG Household Travel Survey was prepared by DKS &
Associates, Inc. to summarize travel characteristics, such as mode choice, reflected in the 2000 data.
Given the scope of the SACOG Household Survey, the Capitol Towers Travel Survey is used in
combination to identify reasonable assumptions for mode splits at the proposed site.

Transit and walk, bike and other non-auto travel mode splits for the proposed project were calculated
as the percentage recorded in the Capitol Towers Travel Survey minus the percentage reported in the
2001 Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report for non-urban conditions. For example, the Capitol Towers
Travel Survey found the transit share for residential uses in the a.m. peak hour to be 5 percent and
the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report for non-urban conditions found the transit share in the a.m.
peak hour to be 0.8 percent. Therefore, the transit percentage for residential land uses applied to the
proposed new project is 4.2 percent (5.0 minus 0.8 percent).

The difference between the two percentages is applied because the ITE Trip Generation Manual rates
are based on suburban land use development patterns. The ITE Trip Generation Manual specifically
states that its data are collected at suburban locations with little to no transit service, pedestrian
amenities, or travel demand management programs. As a result, it recommends adjusting trip
generation results to account for transit service, walking and biking for sites with such activity.
Therefore, the ITE Trip Generation Manual rates inherently reflect smaller transit shares captured in
the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report for non-urban conditions (e.g., 0.8 percent in the a.m. peak
hour) and do not capture the additional 4.2 percent of transit riders recorded at the project site in the
a.m. peak hour. The additional 4.2 percent of transit riders is accounted for in our calculations by
subtracting that additional transit share from the total project trips calculated with the ITE Trip
Generation Manual rates. This approach is used to account for transit ride share in the weekday a.m.,
weekday p.m., and daily time periods as well as to calculate the percentages for the walk, bike and
other non-auto travel mode share.

Adjustments for Transit Trips
The transit trip reduction for the retail component of the project was assumed to be 2.2 percent of
the total number of trips. This adjustment to retail trips was based on transit shares from the Pre-
Census Travel Behavior Report for Downtown and Sacramento for work-trips and non-work trips,
assuming 7 percent of retail trips would be work trips.

The transit trip reduction for the residential component of the project was assumed to be 4.9 percent
of the total number of daily trips, 4.2% for a.m. peak hour, and 5.3% for the p.m. peak hour. As
described in the section above, these are based on the transit shares from the Capitol Towers Travel
Survey and the transit shares from the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report. Appendix A contains a
worksheet titled “Adjustments to ITE Trip Generation Rates for High Non-Auto Travel” that
summarizes the Capitol Towers Travel Survey data in the upper right-hand portion of the page.
Appendix B contains a more detailed summary of the survey information.

The combined effect of a 2.2-percent adjustment for trips associated with the proposed new retail
and 4.9-percent adjustment for trips associated with the proposed new residential results in a 3.6
percent reduction in trips (i.e., 3.6% of trips are transit trips) to account for higher transit use
Downtown.

Trip Adjustments for Walk, Bike, and Other Non-Auto Travel
A similar process was used to develop adjustments for higher use of walk, bike, and other non-auto
travel (hereinafter referred to as “walk trips”). The walk trip reduction for the retail component of the
project was assumed to be 11.6 percent of the total number of trips, based on data from the Pre-
Census Travel Behavior Report.

The walk trip reduction for the residential component of the project was assumed to be 38.9 percent
of the total number of daily trips (the walk trip reduction was 40 percent during the a.m. peak hour
and 38.8 percent during the p.m. peak hour). These adjustments to residential trips were based on
the differences between walk shares from the survey of Capitol Towers residents (Downtown) and
the walk shares from the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report. The walk share of total daily trips from
the Capitol Towers Travel Survey was assumed to be 44.5 percent (the average of the 45 percent a.m.
walk share and the 44 percent p.m. peak hour walk share).

Internal Trip Adjustments
After the adjustments were made for transit, walk, bike, and other non-auto travel, an adjustment
was made to account for internal trips between different types of land uses within each parcel within
the project. The internal trip adjustments were performed using procedures recommended by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers for multi-use developments (Trip Generation Handbook, 2012).
Internal trips are trips that would occur between different land uses within the same site without
accessing the street system. The number of trips between parcels was estimated as the total number
of internal trips for the entire project minus the number of internal trips within each parcel. The
worksheets in Appendix A titled Trips Among All Parcels summarize these trip calculations.

No pass-by trips were assumed for retail uses because it is not convenient to drive by, park and stop
to shop due to parking limitations downtown. Most of these types of trips would be served by non-
motorized travel modes – walking or biking.

The automobile and transit trip generation summaries are presented for Option 1 and Option 2
below. Detailed, parcel-by-parcel summary and worksheet calculations are contained in Appendix A.

The rows labeled “Transit Adjustments”; “Walk, Bike & Other Non-Auto Travel Adjustments”; and
“Internal Trips Within This Site” reflect only the trips associated with the proposed new land uses.
Those trips are subtracted from the Total Project Trips to arrive at the Total External Automobile Trips
for the new project. The Total External Automobile Trips for the new project are then reduced by the
number of External Automobile Trips generated by the Existing Land Uses to be replaced (i.e., 206
garden story apartments) and this produces the Net New External Automobile Trips.

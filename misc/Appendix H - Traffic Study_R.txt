Project:      Traffic Analysis for Sacramento Commons
Subject:      Trip Generation Comparison and Site Plan Review


Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) compared the trip generation of the proposed project’s revised land
use scenarios (dated October 2014) to the trip generation for land use scenarios evaluated in the July
2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons. As presented below, the October 2014 land
use scenarios result in either fewer or an equal number of net new trips as the land use scenarios
evaluated in the July 2014 report. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the findings documented in
the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons remain the same with the revised
October 2014 land uses.

KAI also reviewed the modifications to the driveway access from 7th Street to the parcel in the
northeast quadrant of the site. The revised site plan dated October 13, 2014 illustrates the driveway
in a slightly different location on 7th Street and also shows an increased driveway depth. The revised
location on 7th Street does not change the previous findings in the July 2014 report. The increased
driveway depth exceeds the previously identified minimum queue storage for driveway #2 in the July
2014 report. (Please see additional details in the Site Plan Review section, page 7.)


TRIP GENERATION METHODOLOGY
The same trip generation methodology was used to calculate the trip generation for the proposed
project’s revised land use scenarios dated October 2014 and the land use scenarios evaluated in the
July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons. The July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for
Sacramento Commons documents the methodology in greater detail. This section provides a brief
summary of the approach.

The trip generation for Sacramento Commons is based on information compiled by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, 2012 and Trip Generation Manual
User’s Guide and Handbook, 9th Edition, 2012), the travel mode shares from the travel survey at the

December 19, 2014                                                                                             Page 2


existing Capitol Towers apartment building (conducted in February 2008 and March 2008 at the site),
and the Pre-Census Travel Behavior Report: Analysis of the 2000 SACOG House Travel Survey (DKS,
2001).

The following summarizes the land uses used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual to estimate the
initial automobile trips for the proposed project.

          Neighborhood Support/Retail (Parcel 1, 2A, 2B, 3 and 4A): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 820
           for a shopping center; it is a conservative estimate given that specific types of retail is not
           known at this time.

          High-Rise Apartments (Parcel 1 and Parcel 3): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 222, which is
           applicable to apartments in buildings with more than ten levels.

          Mid-Rise Apartments (Parcel 2A, 2B and 4B): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 223, which is
           applicable to apartments in buildings that have between three and ten levels. The ITE Trip
           Generation Manual does not include a weekday daily trip estimate for mid-rise apartments;
           therefore, to estimate the daily trips for the mid-rise apartments, ITE Trip Generation Land
           Use 221 for low-rise apartments was used. The low-rise apartment land use provides a more
           conservative estimate for daily trips than the high-rise apartment land use.

          Live-Work Units (Parcel 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4B): Live-work units were included as part of the
           residential trip generation numbers. These units are expected to house artists or incubator
           businesses where the decrease in trips due to residents working at home is expected to be
           similar to the number of clients visiting the unit. Therefore, trip generation for these units can
           be accounted for using the residential land use category.

          Hotel (Parcel 3 for the Hotel Scenario): ITE Trip Generation Land Use 310 directly applicable
           to hotels providing sleeping accommodations and supporting facilities (e.g., restaurants,
           retail, service shops).

The total automobile trip generation estimates for the proposed project were calculated as the
automobile trips generated by the proposed project minus the existing trips generated by the existing
land uses to be replaced at the project site.

The total automobile trip generation rates were adjusted to account for transit use, walking, biking
and internal trips. Below is a brief summary of these adjustments; the July 2014 Traffic Analysis
Report for Sacramento Commons presents additional information regarding these adjustments.

          Transit Trips
              o For the retail component of the proposed project, assumed 2.2 percent of total trips
                   would be transit trips.

December 19, 2014                                                                                                            Page 3


              o For the residential component of the proposed project, assumed:
                       4.9 percent of total number daily trips would be transit trips;
                       4.2 percent of a.m. peak hour trips would be transit trips; and
                       5.3 percent of p.m. peak hour trips would be transit trips.
          Walk, Bike and Other Non-Auto Trips
              o For the retail component of the proposed project, assumed 11.6 percent of total trips
                  were walk, bike and/or other non-auto trips.
              o For the residential component of the proposed project, assumed:
                       38.9 percent of the total number of daily trips to be walk, bike and/or other
                          non-auto trips;
                       40 percent of a.m. peak hour trips to be walk, bike and/or other non-auto
                          trips; and
                       38.8 percent of p.m. peak hour trips to be walk, bike and/or other non-auto
                          trips.

After the adjustments were made for transit, walk, bike, and other non-auto travel, an adjustment
was made to account for internal trips between different types of land uses within each parcel within
the proposed project. The internal trip adjustments were performed using procedures recommended
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers for multi-use developments (Trip Generation Handbook,
2012). Internal trips are trips that would occur between different land uses within the same site
without accessing the street system.

The project is expected to have a minimal amount of vehicle pass-by trips1. Given the small number of
these trip types, no pass-by trips were assumed for retail uses in the analysis in order to provide a
more conservative analysis.


TRIP GENERATION FROM JULY 2014 TRAFFIC ANALYSIS REPORT FOR
SACRAMENTO COMMONS
Table 1 and Table 2 show the automobile trip generation summary for the Hotel Scenario and No
Hotel Scenario of the proposed project, respectively. These tables correspond to Table 7 and Table 8
in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons.

Table 3 and Table 4 show the transit trip generation summary for the Hotel Scenario and No Hotel
Scenario of the proposed project, respectively. These tables correspond to Table 9 and Table 10 in the
July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons.



1
    A pass-by trip is a project trip that is already on the streets adjacent to the project prior to construction. These trips
will visit the project site but will only impact project driveways and not nearby intersections since they are already
accounted for in traffic data collected for existing conditions.

As shown in Table 9 and Table 10, the October 2014 land uses generate fewer or an equal number of
net new trips for weekday daily and peak periods. The difference in number of trips ranges from zero
to a decrease in trips of 8.8%. Additionally, the trip distribution would be similar due to the minimal
changes in trip generation and the one-way street network of downtown Sacramento. Given the
October 2014 land uses result in either fewer or an equal number of net new trips and that the trip
distribution would be the similar, the findings documented in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for
Sacramento Commons can be considered a conservative estimate of transportation impacts related
to the Sacramento Commons development.


SITE PLAN REVIEW
KAI compared the October 13, 2014 site plan to the previous site plan dated May 20, 2014. The
revised October 2014 site plan illustrates the above driveway accessing 7 th Street approximately 15
feet further south than the previous site plan dated May 20, 2014. The revised driveway also
illustrates increased driveway depth onsite providing more inbound vehicle queue storage reducing
the likelihood of vehicles queuing onto 7th Street.

The revised location shown in the October 13, 2014 site plan does not change the findings
documented in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis Report for Sacramento Commons. The revised driveway
depth exceeds the minimum two vehicle queue storage documented in the July 2014 Traffic Analysis
Report for Sacramento Commons, and thus, the recommendation to provide a minimum of two
vehicle queue storage is satisfied.

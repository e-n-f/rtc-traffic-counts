               Traffic Review and Analysis ­ NE 15th Ave & US1 / Sunrise Boulevard, NE 15th Ave 
Subject:
               and the Publix/ Walgreens access driveway, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 
 

Kittelson  &  Associates,  Inc.  (KAI)  was  retained  by  the  City  of  Fort  Lauderdale  to  evaluate  the 
existing  operating  conditions  and  to  identify  alternative  mitigation  measures  at  the  intersections 
of  NE  15th  Avenue  with  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  and  the  Publix/Walgreens/Liquor  store  access 
driveway  in  Fort  Lauderdale,  Florida.    The  purpose  of  this  memorandum  is  to  document  the 
results  of  this  traffic  analysis.   The  traffic  analysis  included  a  field  review,  a  review  of  historical 
crashes,  and  operational  analyses.    As  a  result,  the  following  alternative  mitigation  measures 
were suggested (also shown in Figure 3 through 5):  

        ·    Restripe  the  Walgreens  access  driveway  (approximately  36  feet  wide)  and  provide  a 
             single  exit  and  entry  lane  only.    This  will  require  coordination  with  the  business 
             owners  served  by  the  driveway.  Motivation:    Vehicles  entering  the  Walgreens 
             driveway  currently  have  difficulty  performing  the  turning  maneuver,  and  were  often 
             observed  tracking  over  the  curb  (northbound)  or  having  to  perform  a  tight 
             southbound  leftturn  maneuver.    This  measure  will  also  reduce  the  negative  offset 
             with  the  adjacent  Publix  access  driveway.    In  addition,  current  traffic  demand  at  the 
             Walgreens driveway does not require two exit lanes.   

        ·    Correct  the  pavement  marking  (MUTCD)  south  of  the  Publix  driveway  between  the 
             two  southbound  lanes  approaching  the  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  intersection  to 
             indicate  the  outside  lane  becomes  a  rightturn  trap  lane.  Motivation:    This  striping 
             would inform motorists in advance (prior to back of queues) to enter the correct lane.

June 30, 2008                                                                                            Page 2


         ·   Restripe  the  northbound  departure  lanes  on  NE  15th  Avenue  north  of  US1/Sunrise 
             Boulevard to the Publix access driveway in one of the following three options: 

             o    Option  #1  (see  Figure  3):  Provide  a  continuous  leftturn  lane  and  a  through  lane.  
                  In  addition,  restripe  the  twoway  leftturn  lane  in  the  vicinity  of  the  access 
                  driveways  to  a  southbound  leftturn  lane  only.   The  twoway  leftturn  lane  as  well 
                  as  dual  northbound  through  lanes  will  continue  north  of  the  Publix  driveway. 
                  Motivation:  This  recommendation  will  remove  the  current  conflict  between 
                  northbound  and  southbound  leftturn  vehicles,  and  also  provide  for  potentially 
                  safer  and  improved  access  to  and  from  the  Publix  and  Walgreens  access 
                  driveways.    This  will  also  allow  eastbound  to  northbound  leftturn  vehicles  from 
                  the  Publix  driveway  to  access  the  second  northbound  leftturn  lane  north  of  the 
                  driveway, thereby not having to negotiate for a gap in northbound through traffic.  

             o    Option  #2  (see  Figure  4):  Provide  only  one  departing  northbound  lane  from  the 
                  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  intersection  to  eliminate  potential  leftturn  trap  lanes  and 
                  introduce  sidebyside  leftturn  lanes  to  serve  both  Publix  to  the  west  and 
                  Walgreens  to  the  east.  Motivation:  This  configuration  will  simplify  the  decision 
                  points and similar to Option #1 addresses the leftturn conflicts. 

             o    Option  #3  (see  Figure  5):  Similar  to  Option  #2  provide  only  one  departing 
                  northbound lane from the US1/Sunrise Boulevard intersection and offset the north 
                  and  southbound  leftturn  lanes,  respectively.  This  will  require  slight  modifications 
                  to  the  driveways,  but  have  no  impact  to  the  parking  areas  and/or  circulation. 
                  Motivation: Option #3 will be the most expensive option, but will establish a more 
                  typical intersection and address the existing operational safe deficiencies. 


EXISTING CONDITIONS EVALUATION
The  existing  conditions  evaluation  identifies  site  conditions  and  the  current  geometric  and 
operational  characteristics  of  the  roadways  within  the  study  area.  A  field  review  and  site 
inventory  was  conducted  in  June  2008.  Figure  1  is  an  aerial  view  showing  the  NE  15th  Avenue 
study area.  


Roadway and Access Configuration

In  the  vicinity  of  NE  15th  Avenue,  US1/  Sunrise  Boulevard  is  a  sixlane  divided,  eastwest  major 
arterial  with  a  speed  limit  of  35  mph.    The  nearest  signalized  intersection  east  of  the  study 
intersection  is  at  US1  and  NE  17th  Way  (approximately  1,550  feet),  while  the  nearest  signalized 
intersection west of the study intersection is located at NE 10th Avenue (approximately 1,500 feet). 
A  signalized  pedestrian  crosswalk  is  located  on  US  1  approximately  900  feet  west  of  NE  15th 
Street. 

NE  15th  Avenue  is  a  twolane  residential  street  south  of  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  with  a  speed 
limit  of  25  mph,  while it's a fourlane minor arterial with a speed limit of 35 mph and continuous

center turn lane north of US1/Sunrise Boulevard.  NE 15th Avenue becomes a twolane residential 
street north of NE 13th Street, approximately 2,000 feet north of US1/Sunrise Boulevard. 

In  the  vicinity  of  the  study  intersection,  the  landuses  are  mostly  commercial  adjacent  to  US
1/Sunrise  Boulevard,  and  residential  beyond  that.    The  Publix  grocery  store  is  located  in  the 
northwest  corner  of  the  intersection.    Access  to  Publix  is  via  a  full  access  driveway  on  NE  15th 
Avenue  (300  feet  north  of  US1),  and  through  NE  13th  Avenue  via  a  rightin/rightout 
configuration on US1/Sunrise Boulevard at NE 13th Avenue.  A Walgreens drugstore and a liquor 
store are located in the northeast corner of the intersection.  These two stores have access through 
a  rightin/rightout  driveway  on  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  as  well  as  a  full  access  driveway  on  NE 
15th Avenue that is aligned approximately 30 feet south of the Publix driveway.

Field Observations

The following is a summary of observations made during the field review: 

US-1/Sunrise Boulevard & NE 15th Avenue.

Traffic  cleared  the  intersection  within  the  allot  signal  phases,  with  no  major  operational 
deficiencies  noted.    The  eastbound  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  leftturn  queue  often  came  close  to 
filling  the  provided  storage  space  (approximately  600  feet),  but  all  queued  vehicles  were  able  to 
make the leftturn before the end of the phase.  In cases where the leftturn demand was less than 
the  required  maximum  time  necessary  to  clear  the  total  storage  length,  the  leftturn  cycle 
terminated early, thereby allowing for the eastwest through phase. 

Providing  dual  eastbound  leftturns  would  address  the  long  queues  and  provide  more  flexibility 
within  the  current  cycle  length.  However,  the  existing  pavement  width  would  not  allow  re
striping  to  accommodate  the  second  leftturn  lane  and  widening  would  be  expensive.  Another 
option was to convert the existing rightin/rightout at NE 13th Avenue to also allow an eastbound 
leftin. This would reduce the eastbound leftturn volume at the signal, but this would reduce the 
existing  eastbound  storage  lane  at  the  signal.  In  addition,  it  is  unclear  how  much  traffic  would 
divert from the signal to the new leftin. Both these options were concluded to be infeasible. 


NE 15th Ave & Publix/ Walgreens access driveway.

The  Publix  /  Walgreens  access  driveways  generally  operated  reasonably  well,  however  the 
following operational concerns were noted:  

         ·   The  Publix  driveway  is  offset approximately 30 feet north of the Walgreens Driveway.  
             This  negative  offset  leads  to  a  degree  of  path  overlap,  meaning  that  simultaneous 
             northbound  and  southbound  leftturning  vehicles  interfere  with  each  others  intended 
             travel path.  The first leftturn vehicle usually had the rightofway, with the opposing 
             leftturn  vehicle  either  stopping  in  advance,  or  performing  a  skewed  leftturn 
             maneuver into the driveway. 

         ·   The  Walgreens  entry  driveway  width  appeared  insufficient,  especially  the  entry  lane.  
             Northbound  rightturning  vehicles  were  observed  tracking  over  the  curb  or  across  the 
             exit  leftturn  driveway  lane.   Similarly,  southbound  leftturning  vehicles  tracked  over 
             the exit leftturn driveway lane, or in the case where there was a vehicle waiting in the 
             exit  leftturn  lane,  they  had  to  perform  a  tight  leftturn  movement  to  avoid  the  vehicle 
             stopped  at  the  exit  leftturn  lane.  Figure  2  shows  the  Walgreens  access  driveway 
             configuration  with  a  southbound  leftturning  vehicle  tracking  over  the  exit  leftturn 
             lane. Figure 2 also shows the northbound rightturn vehicle track marks. 

         ·   Field  observations  as  well as the turning movement counts showed that more vehicles 
             access the Publix driveway as compared to the Walgreens driveway.

HISTORICAL PERMITS

KAI  requested  historical  permits  allowed  for  the  site  northwest  of  the  intersection  of  US1/ 
Sunrise  Blvd  and  NE  15th  Avenue  on  which  Publix  and  Walgreens  currently  resides.    This  task 
included  visiting  the  permitting  office  of  the  City.    KAI  was  able  to  review  the  Publix  site  file, 
including the traffic impact study prepared, but no useful information was obtained.  


EXISTING CONDITIONS ANALYSIS

Data Collection
Turning  movement  counts  were  collected  at  the  intersections  of  NE  15th  Avenue  with  US
1/Sunrise  Boulevard  and  the  Publix/Walgreens/Liquor  store  access  driveway  on  Saturday,  May 
31,  2008  during  noon  period  (12:002:00  pm)  and  on  Tuesday,  June  3,  2008  during  the  pm  peak 
period (4:006:00 pm).  The traffic counts are shown in Attachment "A."  

Due  to  the  seasonal  variability,  traffic  counts  collected  throughout  the  year  are  adjusted  to 
Annual  Average  Daily  Traffic  (AADT)  using  weekly  seasonal  factors.  Each  year,  the  Florida 
Department  of  Transportation  develops  weekly  seasonal  factors  based  on  data  collected  at 
continuous  traffic  count  stations.  To  develop  these  factors,  the  County  was  divided  into  three 
zones: East, SR A1A to US 1; Central, US 1 to SR 7; and West, West of SR 7.   

The  seasonal  factor  report  (shown  in  Attachment  "B")  indicated  that  traffic  volumes  collected  for 
the  first  week  in  June  should  be  increased  by  3%  to  obtain  a  proper  average  annual  daily  traffic 
volume.   Therefore,  the  traffic  counts  collected  on  Saturday,  May  31,  2008  and  Tuesday,  June  3, 
2008 were increased by 3% to account for seasonal variability.

Existing Condition Analysis

KAI  analyzed  the  existing  operating  conditions  of  the  intersections  of  NE  15th  Avenue  with  US1/ 
Sunrise  Blvd  and  the  Publix/  Walgreens/  Liquor  store  access  driveway  using  the  software 
Synchro  7.   The  analysis  has  been  conducted  for  the  weekday  afternoon  peak  hour  and  Saturday 
midday  peak  hour.  Table  1  provides  a  summary  of  the  existing  conditions  analysis,  while  the

The  crash  analysis  indicated  that  a  large  amount  of  rearend  crashes  occurred  at  US1/Sunrise 
Boulevard  and  NE  15th  Avenue.    A  review  of  the  crash  reports  indicated  that  the  majority  of 
crashes  involved  vehicles  traveling  eastbound  and  another  vehicle  slowing  down.  Rearend 
crashes  are  usually  the  predominant  crash  type  at  signalized  intersections,  and  in  this  case  may 
be  partly  attributed  to  the  generally  high  speeds  (exceeding  the  speed  limit  of  35  miles  per  hour) 
at  which  vehicles  travel  along  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  and/or  the  lack  of  rightturn  deceleration 
lanes on US1/Sunrise Boulevard in the vicinity of the intersection.

The  crash  analysis  indicated  that  a  large  amount  of  rearend  and  angle  crashes  occurred  at  NE 
15th  Avenue  and  the  Publix/Walgreens  driveways.    The  detail  crash  records  did  not  contain 
sufficient  information  to  determine  a  trend  or  reason  for  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the  crashes 
listed.  Naturally, these crashes are likely related to the Publix/Walgreens access driveways. 

Alternative Mitigation Measures

Based  on  the  field  observations,  intersection  operational  analyses,  and  safety  analyses  conducted 
at  the  intersections  of  NE  15th  Avenue  with  US1/Sunrise  Blvd  and  the  Publix/Walgreens/Liquor 
store  access  driveway,  the  following  is  recommended  for  consideration  (also  shown  in  Figure  3 
through 5): 

         ·   Restripe  the  Walgreens  access  driveway  (approximately  36  feet  wide)  and  provide  a 
             single  exit  and  entry  lane  only.    This  will  require  coordination  with  the  business 
             owners  served  by  the  driveway.  Motivation:    Vehicles  entering  the  Walgreens 
             driveway  currently  have  difficulty  performing  the  turning  maneuver,  and  were  often 
             observed  tracking  over  the  curb  (northbound)  or  having  to  perform  a  tight 
             southbound  leftturn  maneuver.    This  measure  will  also  reduce  the  negative  offset

June 30, 2008                                                                                            Page 9


             with  the  adjacent  Publix  access  driveway.    In  addition,  current  traffic  demand  at  the 
             Walgreens driveway does not require two exit lanes.   

         ·   Correct  the  pavement  marking  (MUTCD)  south  of  the  Publix  driveway  between  the 
             two  southbound  lanes  approaching  the  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  intersection  to 
             indicate  the  outside  lane  becomes  a  rightturn  trap  lane.  Motivation:    This  striping 
             would inform motorists in advance (prior to back of queues) to enter the correct lane. 

         ·   Restripe  the  northbound  departure  lanes  on  NE  15th  Avenue  north  of  US1/Sunrise 
             Boulevard to the Publix access driveway in one of the following three options: 

             o    Option  #1  (see  Figure  3):  Provide  a  continuous  leftturn  lane  and  a  through  lane.  
                  In  addition,  restripe  the  twoway  leftturn  lane  in  the  vicinity  of  the  access 
                  driveways  to  a  southbound  leftturn  lane  only.   The  twoway  leftturn  lane  as  well 
                  as  dual  northbound  through  lanes  will  continue  north  of  the  Publix  driveway. 
                  Motivation:  This  recommendation  will  remove  the  current  conflict  between 
                  northbound  and  southbound  leftturn  vehicles,  and  also  provide  for  potentially 
                  safer  and  improved  access  to  and  from  the  Publix  and  Walgreens  access 
                  driveways.    This  will  also  allow  eastbound  to  northbound  leftturn  vehicles  from 
                  the  Publix  driveway  to  access  the  second  northbound  leftturn  lane  north  of  the 
                  driveway, thereby not having to negotiate for a gap in northbound through traffic.  

             o    Option  #2  (see  Figure  4):  Provide  only  one  departing  northbound  lane  from  the 
                  US1/Sunrise  Boulevard  intersection  to  eliminate  potential  leftturn  trap  lanes  and 
                  introduce  sidebyside  leftturn  lanes  to  serve  both  Publix  to  the  west  and 
                  Walgreens  to  the  east.  Motivation:  This  configuration  will  simplify  the  decision 
                  points and similar to Option #1 addresses the leftturn conflicts. 

             o    Option  #3  (see  Figure  5):  Similar  to  Option  #2  provide  only  one  departing 
                  northbound lane from the US1/Sunrise Boulevard intersection and offset the north 
                  and  southbound  leftturn  lanes,  respectively.  This  will  require  slight  modifications 
                  to  the  driveways,  but  have  no  impact  to  the  parking  areas  and/or  circulation. 
                  Motivation: Option #3 will be the most expensive option, but will establish a more 
                  typical intersection and address the existing operational safety deficiencies.

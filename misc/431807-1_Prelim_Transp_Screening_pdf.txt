In January 2013, Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) prepared a technical memorandum that
summarizes the data collection effort and existing conditions analysis for the transportation network
surrounding Amtrak’s Auto Train facility in the City of Sanford. As part of the long-term solutions for
enhancing safety and improving operations of this area, three new alternative concepts for a bridge
crossing over the train tracks connecting Pomegranate Avenue to Persimmon Avenue were
developed. These concepts (illustrated in Appendix 1) vary in how the extended Pomegranate Avenue
roadway alignment ties into the existing roadway on Persimmon Avenue:

         Alternative A – Pomegranate Avenue ties into Persimmon Avenue with a 3-legged
          intersection
         Alternative B – Pomegranate Avenue ties into Persimmon Avenue with a 3-legged
          roundabout
         Alternative C – Pomegranate Avenue ties into Persimmon Avenue, with the pavement north
          of the tie-in removed to introduce a cul-de-sac at 8th Street & Persimmon Avenue

These alternatives are intended to provide direct connections between the north and south of the
train tracks. This memorandum documents the potential traffic diversions and network impacts
should either of the alternatives be built.

Study Intersections

The study area consisted of five unsignalized intersections:

         SR 46/1st Street & Persimmon Avenue
         SR 46/1st Street & Pomegranate Avenue
         8th Street & Persimmon Avenue
         9th Street & Persimmon Avenue
         8th Street & Pomegranate Avenue [In proposed alternatives only]

Turning movement counts for SR 46/1st Street & Persimmon Avenue, SR 46/1st Street & Pomegranate
Avenue and 8th Street & Persimmon Avenue were taken from the design traffic technical
memorandum prepared by KAI in January 2013. All turning movement counts were seasonally
corrected and examined; no adjustments were made to balance the volumes between intersections.
The counts are included in Appendix 2.

Traffic Diversion Assessment

In considering the three alternatives, it is assumed that all existing traffic crossing the train tracks
would be diverted to use the proposed Pomegranate Avenue bridge. This analysis does not account
for traffic growth beyond the existing volume levels.

Since all the alternatives have similar alignment and only differ in how it ties into the existing
Persimmon Avenue roadway, it is assumed that the total diverted trips are consistent between
alternatives. All existing northbound trips crossing the train tracks and leaving the 8 th Street &
Persimmon Avenue intersection were rerouted to SR 46/1st Street through Pomegranate Avenue.
Similarly, all existing southbound trips crossing the train tracks and entering Persimmon Avenue from
SR 46/1st Street were diverted through the Pomegranate Avenue. The total diverted trips are as
follows:

        In the AM peak hour, a total of 43 northbound trips and 73 southbound trips were diverted
        In the PM peak hour, a total of 35 northbound trips and 47 southbound trips were diverted

The volumes for the diverted trips are summarized in Appendix 3.

The resultant turning movement volumes after adjusting for the diverted trips in Alternative A and B
are identical. In Alternative C, a cul-de-sac is proposed on the south leg of 8th Street & Persimmon
Avenue. This results in the removal of a direct connection between 8th Street and 9th Street at
Persimmon Avenue. As such, it is assumed that all demand for movements between the two
intersections are conserved, and all existing connecting trips were rerouted through the 9 th Street and
Pomegranate Avenue intersection before adjusting the turning movement volumes for the diverted
train track crossing trips.

Intersection Operations

The peak hour intersection operating conditions were evaluated using Highway Capacity Software
(HCS 2010), which uses the evaluation criteria provided in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).
The roundabout intersection at 9th Street & Persimmon Avenue was evaluated using SIDRA 6 using
the HCM 2010 methodology. All unsignalized intersections operate better than the locally-adopted
level of service (LOS) D reference within the City of Sanford’s Comprehensive Plan.

Table 1 summarizes the existing and diverted intersection control delay and LOS at the study
intersections. The HCS 2010 and SIDRA 6 intersection analysis sheets are provided in Appendix 4.

Conclusion

This analysis is based upon a conservative assumption that all train track crossing trips would be
diverted to use the new Pomegranate Avenue bridge. The operating conditions of the alternatives
are all expected to be similar to that of the existing configuration. While this analysis did not consider
future traffic growth, the operations of each alternative as compared to the no-build condition are
expected to be similar.

The evaluation uses the Tier 1 Intersection Form Selection Criteria outlined in the Roundabout
Evaluation and Design Guidelines to determine the best solution for traffic control, while also
keeping in mind that Bend maintains a "roundabouts first" approach to intersection treatments.2

SummaryofPriorTrafficStudies

A previous intersection control study was completed in September 2010 by Kittelson &
Associates at the intersection of Mt. Washington Drive and Simpson Avenue3. In addition,
WHPacific, Inc. prepared a conceptual design report in February 2011 for a recommended single
lane roundabout located at the identified intersection4. The studies implemented portions of the
City's new Roundabout Evaluation and Design Guidelines in an effort to get feedback on the
process. The studies also identified potential property acquisition requirements, used AASHTO
guidelines to provide sight line improvements, and completed a safety analysis based on data
from 2001-2009.

Data collected and assumptions that were used as part of the September 2010 and February 2011
studies are listed below:

    x   Existing AM Traffic Counts (February 11, 2011) with a peak hour from 7:15-8:15am
    x   Existing PM Traffic Counts (February 11, 2011) with a peak hour from 2:45-3:45pm
    x   Single lane roundabout conceptual design

SystemContext

Identifying the system in which an intersection operates is important to determine the factors that
will contribute to its overall function. The existing and future context of the intersection of Mt.
Washington Drive and Simpson Avenue is discussed below. Factors including the motor vehicle
system, pedestrian system, bicycle system, transit system, and emergency response system are
outlined.

MotorVehicleSystem
A field inventory was conducted on December 5, 2011 to determine characteristics of the study
intersection. Data collected included posted speed limits, travel lanes, lane configurations, and
intersection control. The summary of the study area roadways are listed in Table 1.

PedestrianSystem
Field review of the study intersection revealed that concrete sidewalks are present on both sides
of Mt. Washington Drive. On the north leg of the intersection, the sidewalks are adjacent to the
travel lane. On the south leg of the intersection, sidewalks are present on the west side of Mt.
Washington Drive, but are not provided along the east side of the roadway (gap of approximately
3,600 feet). The missing sidewalk on the east side of Mt. Washington was identified in the Bend
TSP as an infill sidewalk, but not a priority need infill.6 At the intersection itself, standard
crosswalks are provided for the east and west legs. Curb ramps are provided at all four corners of
the intersection. Along the west leg of Simpson Avenue, no sidewalks are present. On the east
leg of Simpson Avenue a concrete sidewalk is located on the north side of the roadway and is set
back from the travel lane. On the south side of the east leg of Simpson Avenue, a setback asphalt
sidewalk is present for approximately 1,700 feet (extending to the Park & Recreation District
office, short of SW Century Drive).

BicycleSystem
Along Mt. Washington Drive, a six foot paved bike lane is present on both approaches adjacent
to the travel lane. Near the study intersection along Simpson Avenue, a one to two foot wide
paved shoulder is available on the east leg. Bike lanes do exist on Simpson Avenue further east,
but only for small segments. No bike facilities are provided on the west leg of Simpson Avenue.

TransitSystem
Transit services in the City of Bend are provided by Cascade East Transit. The Galveston 11
Route travels through the study intersection. The one-way route heads west along Simpson
Avenue and then turns south on Mt. Washington Drive. Buses operate Monday through Friday
and have approximately 40 minute headways during the AM and PM peaks.7 A bus stop is
located east of the intersection near SW 18th Street (approximately 1,000 feet from Mt.
Washington Drive).

EmergencyResponseSystem
The fire station responsible for the area surrounding the study intersection is Station 301 (West
Station), which is located at 1212 SW Simpson Avenue approximately three quarters of a mile
east of the study intersection. This station also serves as the Fire Administration Building for
Deschutes County.

The main hospital in town is the St. Charles Medical Center. The medical center is located near
the corner of NE Neff Rd and NE 27th Street, which is approximately five miles northeast of the
study intersection.

The Bend Police Department is located on 555 NE 15th Street, which is east of US 97 and just off
of US 20. The Deschutes County Sheriff's office and the Oregon State Police Patrol office are
located near the north end of town where US 20 and US 97 converge.

LandUse
The existing zoning near the Simpson Avenue/Mt. Washington Drive intersection is Residential
Urban Standard Density and Surface Mining District, as illustrated in Figure 2. The land parcels
in the northeast and southeast quadrants of the intersection are designated as surface mining
along with the east side of the south leg of Mt. Washington Drive. The remaining land parcels
are Residential Urban Standard Density, which provides opportunity for a wide variety of
residential housing types at the most common residential densities in places where community
sewer and water services are available. The residential density rate in this district is 2.0 to 7.3
dwelling units per acre.8 Surface mining districts are to allow the extraction of surface mining
materials needed by the community while protecting the health and safety of adjoining residents
and uses.9

Three public schools are also located near the study area. Nearby schools include Summit High
School to the northwest, Cascade Middle School to the southeast and Miller Elementary School
to the northwest.

IntersectionUse
This section identities the users of the study intersection and quantifies the existing motor
vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle use at the study intersection during the AM and PM peak
periods. In addition, motor vehicle volumes for the future year of 2030 are provided.


ExistingVolumes
Intersection turn movements counted at the study
intersection during the morning (7:00-9:00) and afternoon
(2:30-4:30) peak periods are shown in Figure 3.10 The
peak hour traffic volumes are consistent with those used in
previous analysis and are attached in Appendix A. The
location of this intersection is in close proximately to
several schools; therefore the afternoon peak period is
considered the evening peak since this time period
captures the let-out of school when volumes at this
intersection are highest.

Because the study intersection is located near three
schools, it is subject to passing school children. However,
traffic counts indicate a total of two pedestrians at the            Figure3:ExistingPeakHour
intersection during the AM peak hour and four pedestrians            Volumes
during the PM peak hour. No bicyclists were observed
during these times, but are anticipated to pass through the
intersection.

FutureVolumes
Future traffic demand for the intersection was forecasted to
the year 2030 to analyze future traffic operations. The
future 2030 peak period turn movement volumes were
developed using the Bend MPO's regional travel demand
model "Financially Committed" scenario. Traffic forecasts
were "post processed" following a methodology consistent
with NCHRP Report 25511.

AM and midday peak hour volumes were forecasted by
applying the existing ratio of AM and afternoon volumes to
PM volumes to the post-processed future year PM peak
hour volumes. In addition, traffic forecasts considered the
unique impact of local traffic demand peaks related to area          Figure4:FutureYear2030PeakHour

spikes in traffic. The resulting future 2030 morning and afternoon peak hour turn movement
volumes for the intersection are shown in Figure 4.

DesignVehicle
Both Mt. Washington Drive and Simpson Avenue are classified as minor arterials. Therefore,
they are subject to varying modes of traffic and vehicles. Although the intersection is not located
along a designated truck route, the intersection is located within a residential area and near
schools. It is subject to large vehicles such as emergency vehicles, garbage trucks, construction
vehicles, and school buses. The City's base design vehicle is a WB-50; however, larger trucks
such as a WB-67 should be accommodated12 based on the nearby industrial activities. The
existing traffic volumes indicate the heavy vehicle percentages13 at the intersection to be
approximately 3-4% on Mt. Washington Drive and approximately 2-3% on Simpson Avenue.
The previous study and design concept accommodated a WB-50 and WB-67 for all movements
on all approaches. Additionally, at roundabout controlled intersections, the City's design
guidelines require that emergency vehicles be accommodated at the intersection without the use
of truck aprons or mountable curbs.

BaselinePerformance
This section summarizes intersection safety and existing and future intersection operations. The
purpose is to form a baseline for which future conditions can be compared to.

Safety
To evaluate the safety of the existing intersection, the most recent three years of collision data at
the intersection of Mt. Washington Drive/Simpson Avenue was obtained from the Oregon
Department of Transportation (ODOT) and are attached in Appendix B14. Due to the
proportionality of the number of vehicles entering an intersection and the total number of
collisions experienced, a collision rate describing frequency of collisions per million entering
vehicles (MEV) is used to determine if the number of collisions is significant enough to indicate
that there may be a safety issue. A collision rate of 1.0 MEV or greater typically warrants further
investigation. As listed in Table 2, the collision rate at the study intersection is 0.75, which is
below the 1.0 threshold typically warranting additional evaluation.

    Average annual collisions per million entering vehicles (MEV); MEV based on PM Peak Hour Volumes.

Of the eight collisions reported in the collision records, six resulted from vehicles failing to stop
or running a stop sign. A total of 6 collisions involved southbound approaching vehicles where
the horizontal sight distance is restricted due to the alignment of the roadway and vegetation.
Currently, rumble strips exist along the east approaches of the intersection to provide advanced
warning of an approaching intersection. Along the north and south approaches, two sets of
transverse mid-lane pavement markings are associated with the speed limit sign and the
intersection ahead warning sign.

In addition to the ODOT 2008 to 2010 collision data, the City of Bend has provided a 2011 year
to date set of collision data. The 2011 data set provided by the City of Bend accounts for
collisions occurring in the City of Bend from January 2011 through November 2011. Based on
this information, no additional crashes have occurred at the intersection of Mt. Washington
Drive/Simpson Avenue between January and November 2011.

Operations
The following sections outline the City of Bend's intersection performance measures and
intersection operation standards for various intersection control types.

MeasuresofEffectiveness
The City of Bend uses four measures of effectiveness (MOEs) to evaluate the operation of an
intersection. These measures include the volumes-to-capacity ratio, vehicle queuing, level of
service, and delay. A combination of these four measures are used to evaluate two-way stop
controlled intersections, all-way stop controlled intersections, and a signalized intersection. A
summary of each of the MOEs is given below.
           VolumetoCapacityRatio
           The volume-to-capacity ratio is a measure used to represent the level of saturation (i.e.,
           the portion of capacity that is being used). It is given as a decimal typically between 0.00
           and 1.00 and is determined by dividing the peak hour traffic volume by the hourly
           capacity of a given intersection or movement. A lower ratio indicates smoother
           operations and lower delays. As the ratio approaches 1.00, congestion increases and
           performance is reduced. If the forecasted ratio is greater than 1.00, the intersection, lane,
           or movement is oversaturated and usually results in excessive queues and long delays.
           Queuing
           Queuing reports typically show the 95th percentile queue, defined to be the length of
           queue which is exceeded five percent of the time during the analysis time period. The
           95th percentile is useful in determining the appropriate length of turn pockets, but is not
           representative of what an average driver would experience during their commute.
           LevelofService
           The level of service (LOS) is a measure of effectiveness that is similar to a "report card"
           rating and is based on average vehicle delay. Level of service A, B, and C indicate
                                                         Mt. Washington Drive at Simpson Avenue
                           Intersection Traffic Control Determination and Design Recommendation
                                                                                  January 9, 2012
                                                                                    Page 10 of 19

         conditions where traffic moves without significant delays over periods of peak hour
         travel demand. Level of service D and E are progressively worse operating conditions.
         Level of service F represents conditions where average vehicle delay has become
         excessive and demand is near capacity. The average delay value (in seconds) corresponds
         to each level of service designations.

         The unsignalized level of service calculation evaluates each movement separately to
         identify problems (typically left turns from side streets). The calculation is based on the
         average total delay per vehicle for stop-controlled movements (typically on the minor
         side street or left turn movements). Level of service F indicates that there are insufficient
         gaps of suitable size to allow minor street traffic to safely enter or cross the major street.
         This is generally evident by long delays and queuing on the minor street.
         Delay
         The City's operational performance standard for roundabouts is measured against a
         volume to capacity ratio, but delay is used to compare alternative intersection forms to a
         roundabout. Typically under the same traffic conditions, a roundabout will result in lower
         overall delay than traffic signals and all-way stop control, but may result in higher overall
         delay than a two-way stop controlled intersection.

AgencyOperationalStandards
The City of Bend has established operation standards for two-way stop control intersections, all-
way stop control intersections, roundabouts, and signalized intersections under the jurisdiction of
the City of Bend. Below are the operational standards from the Bend Code ­ Chapter 10-10
Development Code.15

ExistingIntersectionOperations
Intersection traffic operations were analyzed at the study intersection using Synchro 7TM
software, which employs the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual16 methodology for signalized and
unsignalized intersections. The following sections summarize existing and future peak period
intersection operations at the study intersection.

Table 3 summarizes the morning (AM) and afternoon peak hour intersection operations at the
Mt. Washington Drive/Simpson Avenue intersection. Due to the relatively high volumes along
Mt. Washington Drive the side street stop controlled approaches experience significant delay.
The delays experienced along the side streets are at LOS F conditions. This intersection currently
does not meet the City's unsignalized operational standard during the AM and afternoon peak
hours. Existing intersection operation calculation sheets are attached in Appendix D.

PotentialSolutions
In order to reduce delays along the side streets at the study intersection, a preliminary alternative
anaysis was conducted in order to determine the most appropriate intersection configuration to
accommodate future growth to the year 2030. The alternatives analysis focused on intersection
improvements such as all-way stop control, traffic signalization, and a roundabout.
Roundabout
The City currently implements a roundabout first policy17; therefore a roundabout will be
considered as a viable intersection control alternative and carried forward with the alternatives

analysis. The alternatives analysis will determine the required number of circulating lanes within
the roundabout.
AllWayStop
All-way stop warrants were reviewed for the study intersection to determine the merit based on
the requirements outlined in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)18.

An all-way stop would likely be warranted (approximating eight hour volumes from peak hour
volumes) at this intersection based on future 2030 traffic volumes; however this intersection
would fail to meet the City's intersection operational standards for all way stop control (average
delay greater than 80 seconds during the AM and afternoon peak hour). Therefore, this
intersection control was not considered for further analysis.
TrafficSignal
The peak hour traffic signal warrant as outlined in the MUTCD19 would be met based on the
future 2030 afternoon peak hour volumes at this intersection. The warrant computation is
attached in Appendix C. Preliminary analysis indicates that a traffic signal would operate within
the City's operational requirements. Therefore, it was carried forward with the alternatives
analysis.

AlternativesEvaluation

Based on the potential solutions identified in the previous section, both a roundabout and traffic
signal were analyzed in more detail. Each alternative was evaluated using the future 2030 AM
and afternoon peak hour traffic volumes previously identified. The following sections provide a
comparison of the traffic operations and queuing analysis for both intersection alternatives.

Alternative1­Roundabout
The first alternative included a single-lane roundabout, which was evaluated per City of Bend
guidelines.20 A summary of the traffic operations and queuing analysis is listed in Table 5 and
calculation sheets are attached in Appendix F. A concept design for the single-lane roundabout
was completed as part of the previous study, and is included in Appendix H.

* 95 percentile queue likely to occur with the peak fifteen minute flow rates, which is the most comparable to the
queuing analysis of the signalized control scenario evaluated with Synchro/SimTrafficTM

The single-lane roundabout alternative would meet the City's operational standards without any
additional circulating lanes or right-turn by-pass lanes. Additionally, excessive queuing would
not be an issue at the intersection.

Alternative2­TrafficSignal
The second alternative included a traffic signal, assuming the existing intersection lane
configuration. Traffic signal operations were evaluated using Synchro 7TM and queuing estimates
were made using SimTrafficTM. Estimates of 95th percentile queue lengths were determined using
an average of five simulation runs of the SimTrafficTM model.

It was assumed that the traffic signal would operate with protected-permissive left-turn phasing
on the Mt. Washington Drive northbound and southbound approaches and permissive left-turn
phasing on the Simpson Avenue approaches. The results of the traffic operations and queuing
analysis is summarized in Table 6. Intersection operation calculation sheets for Alternative 2 are
attached in Appendix G.

The traffic signal would operate within City standards with the existing intersection lane
configuration. However, additional storage length would be needed for the southbound left-turn
pocket on Mt. Washington Drive. A concept sketch showing the proposed traffic signal layout
and additional left-turn storage is included in the Appendix I. The traffic signal layout would
require widening of the north leg of Mt. Washington Drive to accommodate a longer left turn
pocket.

AlternativesEvaluation
Per the City's Tier 1 Table from the Intersection Form Evaluation Framework, a comparison
between Alternative 1 (Roundabout) and Alternative 2 (Traffic Signal) was performed to
determine the preferred alternative. The comparison is summarized in Table 7.

AdditionalConsiderations
Additional factors that could influence the design of the recommended roundabout were
evaluated, including year of opening operation and multimodal system considerations. The
following subsections discuss each of these factors.

YearofOpeningOperations
A single lane roundabout would operate well within the City's operational standards under
existing year (2010) traffic conditions. A single lane roundabout would be the full build out at
this intersection and no additional work would be required. Table 8 shows the expected day of
opening single-lane roundabout traffic operations and queuing.

MultimodalSystemConnectivity
As described in the system context section, a few multi-modal system connections are missing
near the study intersection (sidewalks to the south and east, as well as bike lanes to the east).

On the east side of the south leg of Mt. Washington Drive, there is a sidewalk gap of
approximately 3,600 feet (sidewalks are complete on the west side of the street). There is vacant
land along this sidewalk gap that could develop and construct sidewalks. Due to the distance of
the gap, the likelihood for future fronting development improvements, and the provision of
sidewalks on the west side of the street, expanding this roundabout project to include a sidewalk
extension may not be warranted at this time. However, the roundabout design should include
sidewalks along the roundabout and ramps as necessary to connect to this future facility.

Along south side of the east leg of Simpson Avenue, the sidewalk ends approximately 1,700 feet
east of the intersection (prior to SW Century Drive). Because the missing link in the sidewalk is

so far away from the study intersection, completing the link is likely outside of the scope for this
project. Currently the sidewalk on the north side of Simpson Avenue should be used by
pedestrians accessing SW Century Drive.

In addition to the missing sidewalk link along Simpson Avenue, bike lanes are also absent for the
entire segment from Mt. Washington Drive to SW Century Drive. Providing this facility would
require significant road widening and is likely outside the scope of this roundabout project.
Future paving or improvement projects along Simpson Avenue should consider constructing bike
lanes.

RecommendationsSummary
The alternatives analysis reveals that a single lane roundabout is the preferred intersection
control at the intersection of Mt. Washington Drive/Simpson Avenue based. Using the City's
intersection form evaluation framework outlined in Table 7, a roundabout would provide safer
motor vehicle and pedestrian operations and result in shorter queues during the AM and
afternoon peak hours than a traffic signal. The design of the single-lane roundabout should
consider:
    x Design vehicles of a WB-50, as well as a WB-50 with "pup" trailer (allowing the truck
        cab to stay in-lane with the trailer potentially tracking onto the truck apron)
    x Design for allowing emergency response vehicles (ambulance and a hook/ladder fire
        truck) to stay in-lane.
    x Accommodate a WB-67 for all movements (with use of an apron if necessary).
    x Improve sight distance, as needed, to the north of the intersection to provide adequate
        stopping sight distance for vehicles approaching the roundabout.

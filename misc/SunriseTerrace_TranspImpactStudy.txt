EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. A proposed 120-lot residential subdivision is located west of NE 24th Avenue, south of NE 339th
   Street, and north of NE Lockwood Creek Road in La Center, Washington. The project site is
   comprised of three tax lots and part of a fourth, which total approximately 34 acres. Two of the
   tax lots are vacant while the other two are occupied by one single-family detached home and
   additional structures used for agricultural purposes.

2. The trip generation calculations show that the proposed development, minus the existing single-
   family home, will generate an estimated 89 trips during the morning peak hour with 23 trips
   entering and 66 trips exiting the site. During the evening peak hour, the property is projected to
   generate an estimated 119 trips with 75 entering and 44 exiting the site.

3. Left-turn lane warrants were not projected to be met for any of the site access study area
   intersections under any of the analysis scenarios.

4. Traffic signal warrants were examined for each of the applicable study intersections and were
   not found to be met for any of the analysis scenarios. No new traffic signals are recommended.

5. Based on the detailed analysis, adequate sight distance is available for the proposed new
   intersection access approaches to NE Lockwood Creek Road, NE 24th Avenue, and NE 339th
   Street. No sight distance mitigations are necessary or recommended.
6. A detailed examination of the crash history at the study intersections shows no significant safety
   hazards and no trends that are indicative of design deficiencies. No safety mitigations are
   recommended.
7. Each of the study intersections is projected to operate within the performance standards
   established by the City of La Center through the year 2017, either with or without the addition of
   site trips from the proposed development. No operational mitigations are recommended.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

INTRODUCTION
This Transportation Impact Study (TIS) addresses the development of a proposed 120-lot residential
subdivision located west of NE 24th Avenue, south of NE 339th Street, and north of NE Lockwood
Creek Road in La Center, Washington. The project site is comprised of three tax lots and part of a
fourth which total approximately 34 acres. Two of the tax lots are vacant while the other two are
occupied by a single-family detached home and additional structures used for agricultural purposes.

This report addresses the traffic impacts of the proposed development on the transportation system in
the vicinity of the site. Based on the scope of work provided by the City of La Center, the report
includes safety and capacity/level-of-service analyses at the following intersections:

        NE 24th Avenue at NE 339th Street
        NE 24th Avenue at NE Lockwood Creek Road
        NE Lockwood Creek Road at NE Highland Avenue
        W 4th Street at Aspen Avenue
        NE Pacific Highway at W 4th Street

Upon development of the project site, the following site access intersections were analyzed:

        NE 24th Avenue at North Local Access Drive
        NE 24th Avenue at South Local Access Drive
        NE 339th Street at Local Access Drive
        NE Lockwood Creek Road at Local Access Drive

The purpose of the study is to determine whether the transportation system in the vicinity of the site
is capable of safely and efficiently supporting the existing and proposed uses, and to determine any
mitigation that might be necessary to do so.

All supporting data and calculations are included in the technical appendix to this report.

LOCATION DESCRIPTION
The project site is located west of and adjacent to NE 24th Avenue, south and adjacent to NE 339th
Street, and north and adjacent to NE Lockwood Creek Road in La Center, Washington.

The subject site is located in a predominately agricultural area, with single-family detached
homes and farmland to the north, south and east. A single-family detached housing
subdivision is located southwest of the site and a La Center High School is located to the

VICINITY STREETS
NW Pacific Highway is classified as a Major Collector by the City of La Center. The roadway
generally has one travel lane in each direction with a posted speed of 25 mph north of the East Fork
Lewis River and a posted speed of 50 mph south of the river. Curbs and sidewalks are provided on
both sides of the roadway north of the river.

W 4th Street, E 4th Street and NE Lockwood Creek Road are classified as Major Collectors by the
City of La Center. W 4th Street has a three-lane cross-section and is located between NW Pacific
Highway and Aspen Avenue. E 4th Street has a two-lane cross-section and is located between Aspen
Avenue and E Ivy Avenue/NE Highland Avenue, where it then becomes NE Lockwood Creek Road.
NE Lockwood Creek Road also has a two-lane cross-section with one travel lane in each direction.
The posted speeds along this route, west and east of the proposed site access onto NE Lockwood
Creek Road, are 25 mph and 35 mph, respectively. A school speed zone with a posted speed of 20
mph is in effect during school hours between E Cedar Avenue and NE John Storm Avenue. Bicycle
lanes are provided for a short distance to the right of each directional outer travel lane of the roadway
at the intersection of NE Lockwood Creek Road at NE Highland Avenue. On-street parking is
partially allowed along W 4th Street and E 4th Street within the downtown area. Curbs and sidewalks
are provided along both sides of the W 4th Street and generally on both sides of E 4th Street. NE
Lockwood Creek Road has curbs and sidewalks along the roadway west of the proposed site access
along NE Lockwood Creek Road.

Aspen Avenue is classified as a Minor Collector by the City of La Center. It has a two-lane cross-
section with a posted speed limit of 25 mph. On-street parking is generally allowed on both sides of
the roadway. Curbs and sidewalks are provided along both sides of the roadway.

NE Highland Avenue and NE 339th Street are classified as Minor Collectors by the City of La
Center. NE Highland Avenue becomes NE 339th Street to the east of the intersection with NE 14th
Avenue. Both roadways generally have a two-lane cross-section with one travel lane in each
direction. NE Highland Avenue has a posted speed of 25 mph while NE 339th Street generally has a
posted speed of 35 mph. A school speed zone with a posted speed of 20 mph is in effect during
school hours between E 4th Street and the eastern edge of the school property line. Limited bicycle
lanes are provided to the right of each directional outer travel lane along the route for a short distance
north from the intersection of NE Lockwood Creek Road at NE Highland Avenue. Curbs and
sidewalks partially provided along NE Highland Avenue.

NE 24th Avenue is classified as a Minor Collector by the City of La Center. The roadway has a two-
lane cross-section without centerline striping. There is no posted speed limit; therefore a statutory
speed of 25 mph is applied to the roadway. Curbs, sidewalks, and bicycle lanes are not provided and
the roadway does not have enough width to allow for on-street parking.

STUDY INTERSECTIONS
The intersection of NE 24th Avenue at NE 339th Street is a four-legged intersection that is two-way
stop controlled for the northbound approach of NE 24th Avenue and the southbound approach of NE
340th Circle. All four approaches have a single shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane.



Sunrise Terrace – Traffic Impact Study                                                                  5
The intersection of NE 24th Avenue at NE Lockwood Creek Road is a four-legged intersection,
where the northbound approach is a local access driveway. The intersection is stop controlled along
the southbound approach of NE 24th Avenue and while un-controlled traffic along the access
driveway is expected to stop and yield to traffic along NE Lockwood Creek Road. All intersection
approaches have a single full-movement turn lane.

The intersection of NE Lockwood Creek Road at NE Highland Avenue is a four-legged intersection
and is two-way stop controlled for the northbound approach of E Ivy Avenue and the southbound
approach of NE Highland Avenue. The all intersection approaches have one left-turn lane and one
shared through/right-turn lane with a bicycle lane to the right of the outer travel lane. Intersection
crosswalks are marked on all intersection legs.

The intersection of W 4th Street at Aspen Avenue is a three-legged intersection that is stop controlled
for the southbound approach of Aspen Avenue. The southbound approach has one left-turn lane and
one right-turn lane. The eastbound approach of W 4th Street has one left-turn lane and one through
lane. The westbound approach of E 4th Street has a single shared through/right-turn lane.
Intersection crosswalks are striped on the northern and western intersection legs.

The intersection of NE Pacific Highway at W 4th Street is a four-legged intersection and is two-way
stop controlled for the eastbound approach of the Chips Casino driveway access and the westbound
approach of W 4th Street. The northbound approach has one right-turn lane and one shared left-
turn/through lane. The southbound approach has one left-turn lane and one shared through/right-turn
lane. The westbound approach has one left-turn and one right-turn lane. The eastbound approach is
striped as having one right-turn lane, however this striping is not always observed and vehicles
occasionally make through movements. Intersection crosswalks are marked on the northern, eastern,
and western intersection legs. The southern leg of the intersection does not provide a marked
crosswalk.

A vicinity map displaying the project site, vicinity streets, and the study area intersections with their
associated lane configurations is shown in Figure 1 on page 7.

TRAFFIC COUNTS
Traffic counts were conducted at the study area intersections on Thursday, June 4th, 2015 from 7:00
AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Data corresponding to each intersection’s peak hour
was used for analysis.

Figure 2 on page 8 shows the existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the study area
intersections.

TRIP GENERATION & DISTRIBUTION

TRIP GENERATION
The proposed development will construct 120 single-family detached houses and the remove one
existing single-family detached home and existing farmland. To estimate the number of trips that
will be generated by the proposed development, trip rates from the TRIP GENERATION MANUAL,
Ninth Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), were used. Data from
land-use code 210, Single-Family Detached Housing, was used to estimate the proposed
development’s trip generation based on the number of dwelling units.

The trip generation calculations show that the proposed development, minus the existing single-
family home, is projected to generate a total of 89 trips during the morning peak hour, with 23 trips
entering and 66 trips exiting the site. During the evening peak hour, the property is projected to
generate a total of 119 trips with 75 entering and 44 exiting the site. During a typical weekday, the
site is projected to generate total of 1,132 daily trips, with half entering and half exiting the site.

The trip generation estimates are summarized in Table 1. Detailed trip generation calculations are
included in the technical appendix to this report.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION
The directional distribution of site trips to and from the proposed development was estimated based
on locations of likely trip destinations, locations of major transportation facilities in the site vicinity,
and existing travel patterns at study area intersections.

The following trip distribution was estimated and used for analysis:

        75 percent to and from the south along NW Pacific Highway.
        10 percent to and from the north along NW Pacific Highway.
        10 percent to and from the east along NE Lockwood Creek Road.
        5 percent to and from the south along E Ivy Avenue (primarily to schools).

The proposed development is planned to have four accesses connecting the project site to adjacent
roadways; two accesses intersecting NE 24th Avenue, one access intersecting NE Lockwood Creek
Road, and one access intersecting NE 339th Street. Based on the site layout and trip distribution,
projected trips generated by the project site are anticipated to utilize site accesses accordingly:

        37 percent of trips generated will utilize the access along NE Lockwood Creek Road.
        30 percent of trips generated will utilize the access along NE 339th Street.
        20 percent of trips generated will utilize the south access along NE 24th Avenue.
        13 percent of trips generated will utilize the north access along NE 24th Avenue.

The trip distribution and assignment of site trips generated by the proposed development during the
morning and evening peak hours is shown in Figure 3 on page 11.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS

BACKGROUND TRAFFIC
To provide analysis of the impact of the proposed development on the nearby transportation
facilities, an estimate of future traffic volumes is required. In order to calculate the future traffic
volumes, a compounded growth rate of two percent per year for an assumed build-out condition of
two years was applied to the measured existing traffic volumes to approximate year 2017
background conditions.

Figure 4 on page 13 shows the projected year 2017 background volumes for the morning and
evening peak hour traffic volumes of the study area intersections.

BACKGROUND PLUS SITE TRIPS
Peak hour trips calculated to be generated form the proposed development, as described earlier
within the Trip Generation section, were added to the project year 2017 background traffic volumes
to obtain the projected 2017 background plus site trips.

Figure 5 on page 14 shows the projected year 2017 peak hour background traffic volumes with the
addition of site trips from the proposed development.




Sunrise Terrace – Traffic Impact Study                                                                    12
INTERSECTION CAPACITY AND LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
To determine the performance of the study intersections, a capacity analysis was conducted for the
morning and evening peak hours for existing conditions, year 2017 background conditions, and year
2017 background plus site trips from the proposed development. The analysis was conducted
according to the unsignalized intersection analysis methodology given in the HIGHWAY CAPACITY
MANUAL (HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board.

Levels of service (LOS) can range from LOS A, which indicates very little or no delay experience by
vehicles, to LOS F, which indicates a high degree of congestion and delay. The City of La Center’s
operating standards, outlined in the La Center Urban Area Capital Facilities Plan (2008), require
LOS D or better for signalized intersections and LOS E or better for unsignalized intersections.
Intersections comprised of local streets do not have an LOS standard.

The intersection of NE 24th Avenue at NE 339th Street currently operates at LOS A during the
morning and evening peak hours and is expected to remain LOS A for the morning and evening peak
hours through year 2017. With added project trips, the intersection is expected to increase to LOS B
during the morning peak hour and remain LOS A during the evening peak hour.

The intersection of NE 24th Avenue at NE Lockwood Creek Road currently operates at LOS B for
morning and evening peak hours. The intersection is expected to remain LOS B during the morning
and evening peak hours through year 2017, with or without added project trips.

The intersection of NE Lockwood Creek Road and NE Highland Avenue currently operates at LOS
C during morning and evening peak hours. Under year 2017 background conditions, the intersection
is projected to increase to LOS D during the morning peak hour and remain LOS C during the
evening peak hour. Upon competition of the proposed development, the intersection is expected to
increase to LOS E during the morning peak hour and remain at LOS C during the evening peak hour.

The intersection of W 4th Street at Aspen Avenue currently operates at LOS C for morning and
evening peak hours. The intersection is expected to remain LOS C during the morning and evening
peak hours through year 2017, with or without added project trips.

The intersection of NE Pacific Highway and W 4th Street currently operates at LOS B during the
morning peak hour and LOS C during the evening peak hour. Under year 2017 background
conditions, the intersection is projected to increase to LOS C during the morning peak hour and
remain LOS C during the evening peak hour. With added project trips in year 2017, the intersection
is expected to remain at LOS C during the morning and evening peak hours.

Upon competition of the proposed development, four new site access intersections were analyzed.
The intersection of NE 24th Avenue at the North Local Access Drive is projected to operate at LOS
A during morning and evening peak hours. Likewise, the intersection of NE 24th Avenue at the South
Local Access Drive is projected to operate at LOS A during morning and evening peak hours. The
intersection of NE 339th Street at the Local Access Drive is projected to operate at LOS B during the
morning and evening peak hours. The intersection of NE Lockwood Drive and Local Access Drive is
expected to operate at LOS B during the morning peak hour and LOS A during the evening peak
hour.

Based on the detailed analysis, all studied intersections are projected to operate within the
performance standards established by the City of La Center through the year 2017, with or without
the trips from the proposed development. Accordingly, no operational mitigations are required or
recommended.

The results of the capacity analysis, along with the levels of service, delay, and v/c ratios are shown
in Table 2 on the following page. Detailed calculations, as well as tables showing the relationships
between delay and level of service are included in the technical appendix to this report.

SAFETY ANALYSIS

WARRANT ANALYSIS
Left-turn lane and traffic signal warrants were examined for each of study intersections where such
treatments would be applicable.

A left-turn refuge is primarily a safety consideration for the major street, removing left-turning
vehicles from the through traffic stream. The left-turn lane warrants used were developed from the
National Cooperative Highway Research Project’s (NCHRP) Report 457. The turn lane warrants
were evaluated based on the number of advancing and opposing vehicles as well as the number of
left-turning vehicles, the travel speed, and the number of through travel lanes.

Left-turn lane warrants were not projected to be met for any of the site access study area
intersections under any of the analysis scenarios.

Traffic signal warrants were examined at study area intersection to determine whether the installation
of a new traffic signal will be warranted at the intersection upon build-out of the proposed
development. Due to insufficient main and side-street traffic volumes, traffic signal warrants are not
met for any unsignalized study area intersections under any of the analysis scenarios. No new
installations of traffic signals are recommended.

SIGHT DISTANCE
Intersection sight distance was evaluated at each of the proposed accesses for the proposed
development. The minimum required intersection sight distance was determined in accordance with
A POLICY ON GEOMETRIC DESIGN OF HIGHWAYS AND STREETS, published in 2011 by the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Intersection sight
distance measurements are based on an approaching driver’s eye height of 3.5 feet above the road
and an eye height of 3.5 feet with the opposing driver’s eye 15 feet behind the edge of the near-side
travel lane.

NE Lockwood Creek Road

The access on NE Lockwood Creek Road will be located approximately 100 feet east of the western
edge of the project site that intersects NE Lockwood Creek Road. Based on the posted speed limit of
35 mph, a minimum of 390 feet of intersection sight distance is required in both directions of the
access to ensure uninterrupted flow of through traffic. Intersection sight distance for vehicles turning
right and left from the proposed site access are 890 feet to the east, limited by foliage along the
roadway, and 1,490 feet to the west, limited by the crest of a hill, respectively. Left-turning vehicles
from NE Lockwood Creek Road to the site access have a sight distance of 1,546 feet to the east,
limited by a combination of roadside vegetation and a power pole.

NE 24th Avenue – South Access

The south access on NE 24th Avenue will be located approximately 125 feet north of the southern
edge of the project site that intersects with NE 24th Avenue. The proposed access is situated on a

Sunrise Terrace – Traffic Impact Study                                                               18
roadway sloping uphill to the north at a 6.25 percent grade. Based on the statutory residential speed
limit of 25 mph, a minimum of 280 feet of intersection sight distance is required in both directions.
Intersection sight distance for northbound vehicles is measured at 637 feet, limited by a tree along
the western edge of NE 24th Avenue. For southbound vehicles intersection sight distance was
measured to be 253 feet, where sight distance is obstructed by the crest of the vertical curve of a hill.
Since 253 feet is less than the 280 feet required for intersection sight distance, stopping sight
distance was investigated.

As explained in the AASHTO manual, stopping sight distance is considered the minimum
requirement to ensure safe operation of the driveway. This is the distance that allows an oncoming
driver to see a hazard n the roadway, react, and come to a complete stop if necessary to avoid a
collision. Conversely, intersection sight distance is an operational measure, intended to provide
sufficient line of sight along the major street so that a driver could turn from the driveway without
impeding traffic flow.

In this case, stopping sight distance is the appropriate standard since NE 24th Avenue is a local rural
street with features that already require the attention of drivers traveling the road, such as narrow
driveways that are lined with natural vegetation.

Based on the posted speed limit of 25 mph and an upward grade of 6.25 percent to the north, a
minimum of 165 feet of stopping sight distance is required for southbound vehicles and 143 feet for
northbound vehicles. Since sight distance for northbound vehicles is measured at 637 feet and 253
feet for southbound vehicles, adequate stopping sight distance is available looking both to the north
and the south from the subject access location.

NE 24th Avenue – North Access

The north access on NE 24th Avenue will be located approximately 500 feet south of NE 339th Street.
Based on the posted speed limit of 25 mph, a minimum of 280 feet of intersection sight distance is
required in both directions of the access. Intersection sight distance for vehicles turning right and
left from the proposed site access are 533 feet to the north and 637 feet to the south, respectively.
Left-turning vehicles from the NE 24th Avenue to the north site access have a sight distance of 1,369
feet to the north. Obstructions to sight distance in both the north and south directions are caused the
crest of hills along NE 24th Avenue.

NE 339th Street

The access on NE 339th Street will be located approximately 145 feet east of the western property
line of the project site. Based on the posted speed limit of 35 mph, a minimum of 390 feet of
intersection sight distance is required in both directions of the access. Intersection sight distance for
vehicles turning right and left from the proposed site access are 665 feet to the west and 671 feet to
the east, respectively. Left-turning vehicles from the NE 339th Street to the site access have a sight
distance of 665 feet to the west. Obstructions to sight distance in both directions are caused the crest
of hills along NE 339th Street.

Based on the detailed analysis, adequate sight distance is available for the proposed new intersection
access approaches to NE Lockwood Creek Road, NE 24th Avenue, and NE 339th Street. No sight
distance mitigations are necessary or recommended.

CRASH DATA ANALYSIS
Using data obtained from WSDOT’s Crash Data and Reporting Branch, a review was performed for
the most recent five years of available crash data (January of 2010 through December of 2014) at
each of the study area intersections. A crash rate was calculated under the common assumption that
traffic counted during the evening peak period represents 10 percent of the average daily traffic
(ADT) at the intersection. Crash rates greater than 1.0 crashes per million entering vehicles (CMEV)
are generally indicative of a need for further investigation and possible mitigation.

The intersection of NE 24th Avenue at NE 339th Street had no reported crashes during the five year
analysis period.

The intersection of NE 24th Avenue at NE Lockwood Creek Road had a total of two crashes during
the analysis period. One of the crashes was a rear-end collision while the other was a fixed object
collision, where the motorist drove off the road. One crash reported “property damage only” while
the other crash reported “possible injury”. The crash rate for the intersection was calculated to be
0.31 CMEV.

The intersection of NE Lockwood Creek Road at NE Highland Avenue reported four crashes during
the analysis period. Two of the crashes were turning-type collisions, one was a rear-end collision,
and one was a fixed object collision caused by speeding. All crashes reported “property damage
only”. The crash rate for the intersection was calculated to be 0.30 CMEV.

The intersection of W 4th Street at Aspen Avenue had a total of three crashes during the analysis
period. There were two rear-end collisions and a fixed object collision, where an alcohol intoxicated
driver crashed into a building. The two rear-end collisions resulted in “property damage only” while
the fixed object collision resulted in “serious injuries”. The crash rate for the intersection was
calculated to be 0.19 CMEV.

The intersection of NE Pacific Highway at W 4th Street had a total of five crashes during the analysis
period. Three of these crashes were turning-type collisions, one was a rear-end collision, and one
was a collision with a pedestrian. Two of the crashes were resulted in “property damage only”, two
resulted in “possible injury”, and one resulted in “serious injury”. The crash resulting in “serious
injury” involved a pedestrian crossing NE Pacific Highway whereby a northbound motorist failed to
yield right-of-way to the pedestrian. The crash rate for the intersection was calculated to be 0.24
CMEV.

Based on detailed review of all crash data, no significant patterns are evident and the crash data does
not appear to be indicative of a significant safety hazard. Accordingly, no safety mitigations are
recommended.

CONCLUSIONS
Each of the study intersections is projected to operate within the performance standards established
by the City of La Center through the year 2017, either with or without the addition of site trips from
the proposed development. No operational mitigations are recommended.

A detailed examination of the crash history at the study intersections shows no significant patterns
are evident and the crash data does not appear to be indicative of a significant safety hazard. No
safety mitigations are recommended.

Sight distance was examined at the site access locations. All site access locations were determined to
have acceptable intersection sight distance, with the exception of NE 24th Avenue at the South Local
Access Drive, which was observed to have acceptable stopping sight distance.

Signal warrants were examined for all studied intersections and were not met under any of the
analysis scenarios. Traffic volumes on the major and minor-street approaches at the remaining study
intersections were too low to meet traffic signal warrants. No new traffic signals are recommended.

Left-turn lane warrants were examined at the site access locations and were not met under any of the
analysis scenarios. No left-turn lane mitigation is recommended.

Based on the analysis, the transportation system in the site vicinity is capable of safely supporting the
proposed development.

                                  LEVEL OF SERVICE


        Level of service is used to describe the quality of traffic flow. Levels of service A
to C are considered good, and rural roads are usually designed for level of service C.
Urban streets and signalized intersections are typically designed for level of service D.
Level of service E is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. For unsignalized
intersections, level of service E is generally considered acceptable. Here is a more
complete description of levels of service:

        Level of service A: Very low delay at intersections, with all traffic signal cycles
clearing and no vehicles waiting through more than one signal cycle. On highways, low
volume and high speeds, with speeds not restricted by other vehicles.

        Level of service B: Operating speeds beginning to be affected by other traffic;
short traffic delays at intersections. Higher average intersection delay than for level of
service A resulting from more vehicles stopping.

        Level of service C: Operating speeds and maneuverability closely controlled by
other traffic; higher delays at intersections than for level of service B due to a significant
number of vehicles stopping. Not all signal cycles clear the waiting vehicles. This is the
recommended design standard for rural highways.

        Level of service D: Tolerable operating speeds; long traffic delays occur at in-
tersections. The influence of congestion is noticeable. At traffic signals many vehicles
stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. The number of signal cycle
failures, for which vehicles must wait through more than one signal cycle, are noticeable.
This is typically the design level for urban signalized intersections.

        Level of service E: Restricted speeds, very long traffic delays at traffic signals, and
traffic volumes near capacity. Flow is unstable so that any interruption, no matter how
minor, will cause queues to form and service to deteriorate to level of service F. Traffic
signal cycle failures are frequent occurrences. For unsignalized intersections, level of
service E or better is generally considered acceptable.

        Level of service F: Extreme delays, resulting in long queues which may interfere
with other traffic movements. There may be stoppages of long duration, and speeds may
drop to zero. There may be frequent signal cycle failures. Level of service F will typically
result when vehicle arrival rates are greater than capacity. It is considered unacceptable by
most drivers.

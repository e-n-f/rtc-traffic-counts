                                             Korp Property
                                     Rezone Application Narrative

Resource Conservation of Sarasota, LLC has prepared a rezone application and related development
concept plan (DCP) (non-binding) for the project known as the "Korp Property". The Korp Property totals
approximately 40.58 acres and proposes to include approximately 126 residential dwelling units with
related open space. Currently, the Korp Property is proposed to be developed in one phase with
construction beginning in 2014 and build-out/occupancy anticipated by 2020.

Korp Property is located in south Sarasota County, east of Englewood Road (SR 776), east of the current
terminus of Boca Royale Boulevard. Access is proposed to this property via an extension of the Boca
Royale Boulevard and a future roadway connection to the north (Boca Royale future units); no access to
Tangerine Woods is proposed. The Korp Property is intended, and designed, to be an extension of the
existing Boca Royale development.

As identified on the Sarasota County Future Land Use Map (FLUM), the property is designated as
Moderate Density Residential (MODR) and is currently zoned Open Use Estate 1 (OUE-1). Consistent
with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, the Applicant proposes rezoning the subject property to
Residential Single-Family 3 (RSF-3) up to 4.0 dwelling units per acre and develop the property consistent
with the Cluster Subdivision standards (note: the proposed density per the non-binding DCP is 3.2 du/ac).
The Cluster Subdivision standards allows the applicant to provide site specific development (lot)
standards including residential type, size and setbacks. These standards also require the applicant set
aside 30 percent of the site for open space and provide a 1 percent community focal point. As illustrated
on the non-binding DCP, a minimum of 30 percent of the site is identified for open spaces (i.e., wetland,
wetland buffer, lake features, and natural buffers).

Korp Property is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan with regard to development form,
program and intent. The neighborhood is intended to have specific design features and qualities, including
increased attention to overall project design, connectivity, and the natural environment. Specifically, the
project contains the following design elements including:

    ·   Compatibility with the adjacent development patterns and developed densities along SR 776 and
        adjacent residential developments to the east, south and west.

    ·   Open space provisions incorporated into the overall plan, including a 1 percent neighborhood
        focal point.

    ·   Open space/buffering along the north, west and south boundaries.

    ·   Access to N. Cayman Isles Boulevard.

Korp Property density and development pattern are compatible and consistent with the adjacent
properties, specifically the Boca Royale community as well as developments within the SR 776 corridor
with regard to development pattern and density. As previously noted, the Korp Property is designed to be
an extension of the existing Boca Royale development, utilizing (providing) access to the community's
recreational amenities and facilities (golf, tennis, clubhouse). The applicant is proposing to provide
buffers along the eastern and southern boundaries consisting of the existing vegetation (augmenting
where necessary to meet County standards). There is an existing FP&L easement extending north along
the eastern boundary which encroaches approximately 170' into the Korp property. The proposed lakes
adjacent to the wetland will also provide an additional wildlife habitat and a diversified environmental
feature not currently found on the property. Note, the property is currently improved pasture with no
native habitats on-site.

                                           Korp Property
                                    Rezone Application Narrative

The property is located within the Englewood Sector Plan (Resolution 86-480) and is consistent with the
relevant components of that Plan as follows:

   ·   Demonstrates capacity and availability of essential urban services including roadways, water and
       sewer, police and fire protection and medical services. Note:

           o   Access is provided via the internal Boca Royale roadway network with two (2) access
               points to SR 776, a state maintained arterial roadway.

           o   Provides for public water and sanitary sewer. Note: utilities will be provided via the
               Englewood Water District (EWD). A letter of service availability from EWD is provided
               with this application.

           o   Existing police and fire (Sarasota County Sheriff and Sarasota County Fire).

           o   Existing medical services (Venice Regional Medical Center and the Englewood
               Community Hospital are within approximately 6 miles of Boca Royale; additional
               facilities are located in close proximity).

   ·   Additional components of the Englewood Sector Plan are not applicable. Specifically, the Korp
       Property does not propose commercial development and is therefore not subject to Condition #5
       of the Englewoood Sector Plan.

attached sign in sheets).

The neighborhood workshop was convened at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday November 14, 2013 at Boca Royale
Clubhouse, 1601 Englewood Road #1, Englewood, Florida. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss a
proposal for the Korp Property Rezone Application. The workshop notice was published in the Venice
Gondolier Sun, Englewood Sun, and North Port Sun on November 6, 2013; and notice was given on
November 1, 2013, by mail to adjacent property owners as identified by Sarasota County.

The meeting was convened by Mr. Pat Neal of Neal Communities with an overview of the Korp Property,
Neal Communities team and history of development, and Boca Royale, including history of the Boca
Royale community.

Mr. Kirk Crane with Sarasota County Planning Services provided an overview of the regulatory process,
formal requirements for rezoning applications and neighborhood meetings as required by Sarasota County
ordinance and the subsequent reviews by County staff, public hearings before the Planning Commission
and the Board of County Commissioners including public notices.

Mr. Neal provided an overview and additional information regarding Neal Communities including
community/neighborhood meetings with residents in Boca Royale. Mr. Neal also noted Tangerine
Woods residents' comments and concerns he had received to date including stormwater/drainage. Mr.
Neal then identified the team present to answer questions.

Mr. Kelley Klepper provided an overview of the Korp Property rezone application (rezoning request),
development program and related development concept plan (DCP) including components of the
development, connectivity with the existing Boca Royale development (Unit 11), buffer locations, open
spaces and proposed uses. Mr. Klepper also identified the previous Boca Royale approvals including land
use, density and access to SR 776 (no access is proposed to Tangerine Woods).

The following comments or questions were proposed by members of the public and addressed by the
developer and/or their representatives:

                               KORP PROPERTY REZONE
                                  NOVEMBER 14, 2013

   1. Where is the internal access, is it all to Boca Royale Blvd? Answer: the previous applications
      including the traffic analysis, analyzed the maximum amount of development allowable, and
      impacts to the roadway. 776 was determined to accommodate the traffic levels

   2. What does Sarasota County Commissioners think about 400 plus people going down one road?
      Answer: This is not a new phenomenon, this is pretty consistent with other developments.

   3. All of the traffic will use one access? Will this traffic go to Pine Street? Answer: There are
      actually two access points to Boca Royale including an existing construction traffic access. This
      traffic will not go to Pine Street; Sarasota County swapped the Pine Street right-of-way for
      additional right-of-way including the EIC. Pine Street ran north-south, not east-west.

   4. There needs to be a dedicated construction access? There is too much construction traffic for
      one access. There needs to be a buffer between the residents and the construction traffic. 400
      homes equates to approximately 246 cars, almost 700 cars going down Boca Royale Boulevard;
      is that normal? Answer: There is an existing access point for construction and that is something
      Neal Communities can look into. Mr. Neal asked the resident if he had any ideas and he (Mr.
      Neal) would listen to those. Mr. Neal noted some additional developments that have increased
      traffic/volume on similar or less access points.

   5. Where does the drainage go? How close is the project to Tangerine Woods? Answer: Mr. Neal
      asked the resident to meet with the project engineer to review the drainage direction/patterns. Mr.
      Klepper identified on the map the project location, buffer locations, FP&L easement location and
      width, Boca Royale boundary in relation to Tangerine Woods.

   6. There is an existing road in Tangerine Woods that touches the property; what's going to happen
      to that road? Answer: we are not attaching to Tangerine Woods, no access is proposed to
      Tangerine Woods. We are adjacent to Tangerine Woods but not providing access. Mr. Klepper
      also noted the buffer location, expectations on the buffer (could be trees, wall or similar) and
      working with the County on the tree buffers.

   7. Does the road in Unit 11 extend further south? Will there be lots on both side of that road?
      Answer: Yes, there will be lots on both sides but we cannot impact the wetland (identified its
      location on the map).

   8. Is this your property, do you own it? Answer: A large portion of Unit 11 is owned by Neal
      Communities; this 40 acre property that is adjacent to Unit 11, is currently owned by George R.
      Thompson Corporation. Neal Communities will be taking ownership in the property. Properties
      to the south of Boca Royale are not included and are under different ownership.

   9. What type of houses will be built? Are they rental? Do you have the costs? Answer: paired
      villas are proposed. We are also proposing to maintain the wetland and will actually be
      augmenting it with lakes beside the wetland to increase the habitat and improve water quality. It
      is understood these homes will be sold, not rental units. Please meet with Christina (present here
      at the meeting) for pricing.

   10. How big is the property? Answer: Approximately 40 acres including the wetland, lakes and
       open spaces along with the paired villas. Mr. Klepper also explained the density of the property.

   11. Will they build a wall as a buffer? Answer: That is still to be determined. Mr. Neal will work
       with the County and his design team to develop a suitable buffer between this property and the
       property to the south.

   12. There is too much traffic coming out onto 776, there needs to be a traffic signal. Answer: These
       are FDOT controlled access points and a signal would be subject to their requirements. Neal
       Communities is completing the plan the Thompsons originally proposed and gained approval for.
       In addition, the County requires a traffic analysis as part of the application. They will be looking
       at the traffic impacts, time of day, turning movements, etc.

   13. Would like to ensure no access to Tangerine Woods. Answer: Based on this plan and the
       proposed development, no access to Tangerine Woods is shown and/or proposed.

   14. What is the buffer and setbacks? Are you installing a wall? Answer: There is approximately a
       40-50' buffer and there is an additional 10' building setback. These units will be approximately
       60-65' from the property line; there are no existing buffers provided by the Tangerine Woods
       development. We will be working with Sarasota County on the buffer type, materials, and tree
       removal (invasive species).

   15. There are no bike paths in the existing Boca Royale; are you going to be providing those and
       connecting them to 776? Answer: Those are not currently provided on the existing roads and
       probably not added.

   16. How many buildings and units will there be? Answer: 126 dwelling units are proposed (63 total
       buildings).

   17. (Unnamed resident) I support the project and am excited to see the additional development;
       development will drive out the snakes and hogs that run across the property now.

   18. We are concerned about drainage. Answer: We cannot exceed the predevelopment rate.

   19. There are drainage problems at the southwest corner because of water coming from the north.
       The outlet is blocked and the swale fills to the top. There are laws prohibiting cleaning the swale.
       Answer: We can't allow more water to leave the site than before construction. This is governed
       by the State/SWFWMD. We also are required to direct water to the same places that it is
       currently going. We can look into and clean out swales that are behind on maintenance as part of
       the project.

   20. Water keeps coming down my street: Answer: We will determine if we have a good outfall and
       address that it. We will be using wetlands and stormwater ponds to address site drainage.

   21. What about the fish that are jumping out of the swales now where there weren't any before?
       Answer: This site is a part of a larger watershed that connects the smaller waterways in heavy
       rainfall events.

   22. Will this affect my flood insurance? Answer: No Impact. Sarasota has stringent drainage rules: no
       more than 1/8" rise to water levels. However we cannot control Mother Nature.

   23. What about hurricanes? Answer: This community has been here for a while.

                               KORP PROPERTY REZONE
                                  NOVEMBER 14, 2013

   24. Who is going to clean the ditch? Answer: That is the County's responsibility.

   25. What if maintenance funding gets cut? Answer: Neal Communities may step in to solve the
       problem.

   26. Where is the runoff ditch? South in the buffer. You can't fight Mother Nature. Answer: In 30
       years of designing drainage systems, I have never flooded a house. We have lakes and wetlands
       to detain the water.

   27. What about ecology and hydrology in Tangerine Woods? Answer: we won't drain any more than
       we do today.

   28. I am not convinced that it won't overrun the drainage ditch. No one will step up to clean it.
       Answer: Drainage ditches often have saddle situations created by thatching. We can't and don't
       want to flood our neighbors. If the County doesn't maintain the ditch, we may help.

   29. What is the time frame for development? Answer: Probably 2 or 3 years.

   30. Thanks for building nice homes. Answer: You're welcome.

   31. How do you get the County to maintain the ditches when they are clogged: Answer: We will just
       give them a call to let them know about the situation.

   32. Oak Forest is happy.

7:32 p.m. meeting adjourned.

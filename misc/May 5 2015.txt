25   businesses that are in support of his campaign to be a Deltona elected official, he feels the code
26   enforcement visits were initiated by one of his opponents, he considers it targeted persecution for
27   supporting him, the action is both morally and legally wrong, if it continues he will refer the matter to
28   the Florida Attorney General and media, and he would keep the Commission informed of any further
29   incidents.
30
31   b)      Carmen Duffy, 1921 Veronica Avenue, stated that she wanted to make the Commission aware
32   of additional benefits for the public sector, Deltona is reported as having some of the highest
33   employment growth in the nation, Colonial Life Insurance now has a local district office, and that there
34   is a complimentary benefit that goes out to the public sector at no cost to the City.
35
36   Mayor Masiarczyk asked Ms. Duffy to provide Mr. Denny with her contact information so he could
37   coordinate a meeting to discuss the benefit.
38
39   c)      Daniel Dudley, 1089 Pearl Tree Road, stated the street sign at Sterling Silver and Alabaster Way
40   is hanging off its pole, on average of 50-60 times a day people are running the stop sign at the
41   intersection of Pearl Tree Road and Sterling Silver Blvd. and asked what the procedure would be to get
42   a rumble zone put in similar to the one at Humphrey Blvd. and India Blvd., there is a new hole in the
43   middle of Sterling Silver Blvd. between Emerald Green and Gold Oaks Drive, Sterling Park Blvd. and
44   Gold Oaks Drive there is a faded stop sign. On the left hand corner of Gold Oaks Drive portions of the
45   neighborhood drainage percolation system had previously caved in by about 2 ½ feet, Public Works
46   was supposed to put up a railing around the site, now it has caved in about another foot and no railing
47   has been installed yet, and theere is continual speeding in the neighborhood.

10   Commissioner Barnaby stated that he is not in agreement with the motion to remove the provision of
11   term limits for Commission members, he is appalled by the lack of understanding by the general public
12   of the responsibility of “We the People”, it takes we the people to form a more perfect Union, once
13   residents have placed someone in official office the public needs to supervise their elected officials and
14   not leave them alone to their own devices, making sure elected officials do not become fearful masters,
15   as a matter of principle and strong Constitutional advocate, and firm believer that America has gotten
16   away from the original intent of the framers of the Constitution, it starts at the City level by educating
17   the general public as to their responsibility, do not elect public officials and leave them “home alone”,
18   kids are not left alone at home or parents may come home to a house that is on fire, the Country is on
19   fire because too many elected officials are left “home alone”, he commended those in attendance at the
20   Commission meeting, and he stated that elected officials cannot run the City by themselves, they need
21   the general public to hold them accountable.
22
23   Vice Mayor Herzberg stated that the Charter Review Committee (CRC) recommended the term limit
24   removal amendment, she personally approves of term limits, but she respects the CRC putting the
25   amendments forward, she is in support of the CRC recommendations, and that it should be left up to
26   voters to decide on each amendment.
27
28   Commissioner Denizac stated the CRC studied the Charter and came forward with recommendations,
29   by consensus of the majority of the Commission the proposed amendments were brought forward,
30   another amendment was added by the Commission, the majority of the recommendations were
31   suggested by the CRC, she is personally in favor of term limits, the Commission salary percentage
32   increase is nothing new, and that she has stated her position on the issue at previous workshops.
33
34   Commissioner Schleicher stated the Commission has agreed to send the amendments forward for voters
35   to decide, the bottom line is exactly what was mentioned by Commissioner Barnaby concerning voters
36   needing to be educated, and that Charter amendments need to be left up to voters.

 5   A.    Request for approval of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Transportation
 6   Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grant.
 7
 8   Chris Bowley, Director of Planning Development Services stated that the TIGER grant application is a
 9   discretionary grant issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT) for economic recovery, DOT
10   appropriated 600 million for fiscal year 2014 for construction projects, this year the grant process is also
11   open for planning and design projects, if the grant is awarded staff would then come back with a request
12   for the 20% matching funds for the project. The project is warranted, due to the proposed expansion of
13   Interstate-4 and the area's population. The project is for a service road parallel to I-4 as a north-south
14   reliever/connector on the East side that is regionally serving, protects the capacity of the area roadway
15   network, relieves some of the pressure off I-4, allows for greater mobility, and would start to match the
16   population mobility needs of Deltona. The project limits would extend from Graves Avenue to DeBary
17   Avenue, utilizing and expanding the existing roadway network that includes Normandy Blvd. and
18   Deltona Blvd. along Graves Road and North Normandy.
19
20   The Commission and staff discussed the previous submission for a Community Redevelopment Area
21   (CRA) in Deltona, much needed infrastructure in the area, the grant just being for planning funds for the
22   design phase, the project being good for economic development and infrastructure in the sector, and the
23   funds mitigating a major cost of Deltona’s request for a CRA, the project tying into the Transportation
24   Planning Organization’s (TPO) area plans, the project being regionally serving, DOT’s upcoming I-4
25   Study, the public meeting scheduled for Thursday April 24, 2014 at City Hall from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30
26   p.m. where DOT will discuss proposed projects in the area, and the deadline of April 28, 2014 for
27   submission of a TIGER grant.
28
29   Motion by Commissioner Barnaby, seconded by Commissioner Nabicht to approve allowing staff
30   to apply for the 2014 TIGER Discretionary Grant and to bring the cost estimate for the feasibility
31   and design to the City Commission for review and approval before any additional action is taken.
32
33   Mayor Masiarczyk opened and closed the public hearing as there were no public comments.
34
35   Motion carried unanimously with members voting as follows: Commissioner Barnaby, For;
36   Commissioner Denizac, For; Commissioner Lowry, For; Commissioner Nabicht, For;
37   Commissioner Schleicher, For; Vice Mayor Herzberg, For; and Mayor Masiarczyk, For.
38
39   B. Request for approval of Resolution No. 2014-07 declaring certain property of the City as
40   surplus and authorizing the sale or disposal of such property.
41
42   The Commission and staff discussed the property not having to be specifically annotated as trade in, the
43   list containing anything that is going to be removed from Deltona’s records, the equipment listed as “not
44   used” being on the list because it is not in use and has been taken out of service, and only property that
45   the City does not have a use for being on the list.
46
47   Commissioner Barnaby commended Mr. Denny and staff for looking for opportunities to cut costs and
48   save the City money.
49
                                                        10                                          Item 4A

10
11   C.    Request for approval to sign engagement letter with Purvis Gray & Company.
12
13   Mayor Masiarczyk opened and closed the public hearing as there were no public comments.
14
15   Mr. Denny stated that the City could either approve the engagement letter with Purvis Gray &
16   Company, or put the item out for bid, and he stated that the last time it went out for bid there were only
17   two (2) firms that bid on the project, and that Purvis Gray & Company was by far the lowest bid.
18
19   The Commission and staff discussed 2009 as the last year the audit project was put out to bid, going out
20   for new bids, there being sufficient time to go out for bid using the City’s purchasing policies, staff time
21   being the only cost to the City to put the audit out for bid, not neglecting the competitive bid process
22   standard procedures, going out to bid being the right thing to do, all audit firms offer the same services
23   and the differences would only be in price, being pleased with the past performance of Purvis and Gray
24   and going out for bid merely being a transparency issue, the reflection on staff for submitting the option
25   to the Commission in accordance with City policy, the Commission preferring to see what bids will be
26   submitted in 2014 as compared to 2009, the surprise at only having two (2) bids in 2009, the statewide
27   access and visibility of the Demand Star system used for advertising bids and what types of firms and
28   companies use the system, and the Commission making sure they have done due diligence in the bid
29   and selection process.
30
31   Motion by Commissioner Schleicher, seconded by Vice Mayor Herzberg to put the request for
32   audit firm out for bid.

 1   13.   CITY COMMISSION COMMENTS:
 2
 3   a)     Commissioner Barnaby extended hardy wishes for Passover to his Jewish friends and hardy
 4   wishes for Easter to his Catholic friends. He discussed a civic and historical event involving a young
 5   Christian Attorney named Patrick Henry who saw first-hand why a jury of peers was so vital to
 6   freedom, in March of 1775 he rode into the small town of Culpepper, Virginia where he was totally
 7   shocked when he saw a man tied to a whipping post being lashed and beaten. When he asked what the
 8   man had done to deserve such a beating, he was told that the minister was one of 12 people that refused
 9   to take a government license. A government license can often become an arbitrary control by the
10   government, which can turn a right into a privilege. Three (3) days later the minister was scourged to
11   death. This incident inspired Patrick Henry to write the famous words, which later became the rallying
12   cry of the American Revolution, “What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so
13   dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!
14   I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”
15
16   b)     Commissioner Denizac wished everyone a Happy Easter, and she stated she celebrates Easter
17   just about every day of her life giving thanks to the one who died for her. She stated that her thoughts
18   and prayers are with the Lundell family, the community lost a very valuable person, a coworker of hers
19   for 20 years who will never get the chance to see his twins who will be born this June. She stated she
20   went to his service this past Saturday and she was amazed to see so many kids, and she applauded all of
21   the kids that showed up for a faculty member and his family. She stated her thoughts and prayers are
22   with the Maples family at the passing of Mike Maples Sr., an esteemed member of the community.
23
24   c)    Commissioner Lowry echoed Commissioner Denizac’s comments and he stated that his heart
25   and prayers go out to both families, and that Mike Maples’ service will be Tuesday at 2:00 p.m..
26
27   d)     Commissioner Schleicher stated that Friday, April 25, 2014 is the Arbor Day celebration in the
28   Courtyard at City Hall from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and on Saturday April 26, 2014 at 10:30 a.m. is the
29   Annual Volunteer Appreciation Breakfast in the City Hall Chambers. She stated she is disturbed and
30   upset by Mr. Jodylee’s comments, the election season has just started, she hopes all of her colleagues
31   and those running will take heed and do the right thing, the City does not need these types of issues
32   going on in Deltona, on Thursday evening she will be taking a proclamation to the Council on Labor
33   honoring and recognizing April 28, 2014 as Workers Memorial Day, a day set aside to recognize all
34   workers who lost their lives or were injured due to workplace safety violations, she discussed work
35   related deaths and injury statistics in America and Florida, Deltona taking a big role in making sure their
36   workers are safe, and encouraged everyone to remember Workers Memorial Day on April 28, 2014.
37
38   e)     Vice Mayor Herzberg stated the Team Volusia Economic Development Committee (TVEDC)
39   meeting is scheduled for Tuesday morning, April 22, 2014, there is discussion of possibly adding a 2nd
40   Boys & Girls Club at Deltona Middle School, a River of Lakes Heritage Corridor banner is located in
41   the City Hall lobby which is a City specific banner from the ROLHC made for each City located on the
42   Corridor to use at their City events, the River of Lakes Heritage Corridor webpage www.rolhc.com
43   should be up soon, she attended the Volusia County Council meeting on April 3, 2014 to support
44   Orange City’s quest for a CRA, their request was tabled to a date specific that Chairman Davis could
45   attend the meeting, planning for roads and CRAs in Deltona and in West Volusia County, Earth Day
46   being Tuesday, April 22, 2014, and she encouraged people to participate in NASA’s GlobalSelfie Earth

REZONINGS/ORDINANCES/FINAL SITE PLANS:

A.    Ordinance No. 02-2014 (RZ13-008), BPUD Rezoning for the Saxon-Sterling
      Silver.
      The Board voted 5-1 to recommend that the City Commission deny Ordinance No. 02-
      2014, Project RZ13-008), a rezoning request from MPUD to BPUD for the Saxon
      Sterling Silver project, located at the intersection of Saxon Boulevard and Sterling
      Silver Boulevard, as presented.

      The application request office uses on lot 1 and commercial uses on lots 2 and 4 of the
      BPUD. While the project would allow for a range of land uses per lot, as requested by
      the applicant, the accompanying Master Development Plan (MDP) and Development
      Agreement (DA) presented shows a ±40,000 SF medical office building and ±5,000
      SF outpatient clinic on lot 1 and a ±44,000 SF grocery store and a ±14,500 SF
      commercial retail center on lots 2 and 4.

B.    Ordinance No. 03-2014, Amending Chapter 70, Section 30 “Definitions”,
      repealing existing floodplain regulations of the Land Development Code
      (Chapter 90), adopting new Chapter 90 regulations, and adopting new floodplain
      maps.
      The Board voted unanimously to recommend that the City Commission adopt
      Ordinance No. 03-2014, Amending Chapter 70, Section 30 “Definitions”, repealing

       existing floodplain regulations of the Land Development Code (Chapter 90), adopting
       new Chapter 90 regulations, and adopting new floodplain maps, as presented. The
       ordinance updated the City’s FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, effective on
       February 19, 2014.

C.     Ordinance No. 04-2014 (RZ13-009), Amendment to the Official Zoning Map.
       The Board voted unanimously to recommend that the City Commission adopt
       Ordinance No. 04-2014, Project RZ13-009, a rezoning request from OR and P to C-2
       zoning designations for an assemblage of land at the northeast corner of Saxon
       Boulevard and Finland Drive. The Board amended that motion to include a
       recommendation to the City Commission to send the Final Site Plan application to the
       Board for their review and recommendation. The Board voted 4-2 in favor of the
       amended motion.

       The rezoning request to a C-2 zoning designation is consistent with the underlying
       Commercial future land use designation and C-2 zoning designations to the east and
       west of the subject site. The applicant requests the ability to ultimately construct a
       Racetrac commercial facility at the location. However, adoption of the ordinance
       would permit the range of permitted land uses within the C-2 zoning district.

                          Community at Sterling Park MPUD and the rezoning was
                          consistent with the underlying Commercial future land use
                          designation.
                          2. The rezoning allowed for a four (4) lot subdivision and lot

       6. Development Standards.

            a. Sidewalks: The Current Owner of the SRV PUD has previously constructed

               sidewalks for the SRV PUD. However, the Owner/Developer or subsequent

               owners are required to improve the sidewalk system associated with the subject

                                                                                        Page 3 of 27

   BPUD specifically from 5-ft. wide to 8-ft. wide along Saxon Boulevard. The

   Saxon Boulevard sidewalk from 5-ft. wide to 8-ft. wide can be constructed on a

   lot by lot basis but must be completed before a Certificate of Occupancy (C/O) is

   issued for lot development. In addition, Owner/Developer or subsequent owners

   will be required to provide a sidewalk network through Lots 2 and 4 to link the

   sidewalk system on Alabaster Way to the Saxon Boulevard sidewalk with the

   intent of providing safe internal pedestrian connections. This sidewalk network on

   Lots 2 and 4 will be addressed through the site plan approval process. The

   Owner/Developer shall also appropriately stripe all crosswalks. Finally, the

   Owner of each lot, or a created property owners association, will be responsible

   for repair and the maintenance of the sidewalk system adjoining such lot. Striping

   within the City’s rights-of-way is to be maintained by the City.

                                                                               Attachment number 2 \nPage 6




   requirements of Section 110-828 (b)(2) of that Code. An illumination plan shall

   with Section 110-828, the amount of parking on Lots 2 and 4 will be figured at

   4.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.

e. Site Access. Subject to the requirements of the County of Volusia (the “County”)

   on Saxon Boulevard, the site access shall be managed as follows:


       1. Except as otherwise provided herein, all development shall meet the City’s

          and County’s transportation concurrency management, driveway design,

          and internal circulation requirements, and no design shall be approved that

          does not meet the City’s Code of Ordinances.

       2. On Lot 1, the following access points and related movements,

          notwithstanding the existing 1 ft. non-vehicular access easement, are

          allowed: 1) A right in/right out access on to Saxon Boulevard. A raised

          concrete    median    will   be   required   to   be   constructed   by    the

          Owner/Developer in the Saxon Boulevard right-of-way across from the

          Lot 1 right in/right out access, along with a concrete ‘pork chop’ (no ‘bat

          wings’). Both the ‘pork chop’ and raised median in the Saxon Boulevard

          right-of-way shall be designed and constructed to discourage illegal left

          hand turns. Such operations shall be constructed and in place prior to the
                                                                           Page 6 of 27


                                       47                                      Item 8A
                                                                      Attachment number 2 \nPage 7




   issuance of the first Certificate of Occupancy on Lot 1. The right in/right

   out on to Saxon Boulevard and median operations shall be subject to the

   approval of Volusia County. 2) Full access, appropriately aligned, at the

   intersection of Sterling Silver Boulevard and Alabaster Way. 3) A right

   in/right out/left in access point to Sterling Silver Boulevard located north

   of the aforementioned access at the intersection of Sterling Silver

   Boulevard and Alabaster Way.

3. Lots 2 and 4 can only be accessed from Saxon Boulevard by a joint access

   driveway at the approximate location of the existing full movement

   driveway of the neighboring Saxon Medical Park facilitated by an

   easement or other joint access agreement, as generally shown on the MDP.

   Provided, however, if the County does not permit the said joint access to

   Saxon Boulevard, access to Saxon Boulevard, if any, shall only be

   permitted if it complies with both City and County design standards. The

   connection to, use of and any needed improvement to the access point will

   be addressed during the City site plan review process. In addition, Lots 2

   and 4 can be accessed off of Alabaster Way at four different points. The

   eastern most located Alabaster Way access point will constitute a stub out

   leading to a 20’ wide easement intended for access to the lift station and

   other public infrastructure. The Owner/Developer will provide a 12’ wide

   paved driveway to the lift station. The next access point to the west will

   feature only right in/right out access to Alabaster Way. The remaining two

   access points to the west on Alabaster Way will be full movements and

                                                                   Page 7 of 27


                             48                                       Item 8A
                                                                          Attachment number 2 \nPage 8




   aligned to effectively intersect with the existing driveway cuts situated on

   Lot 3 of the SRV PUD.

4. A mast arm traffic signal shall be designed, permitted, purchased,

   constructed, and installed by the Owner/Developer. Volusia County may

   allow the mast arm traffic signal to remain in a flashing yellow condition,

   until full signal use is warranted. The mast arm traffic signal shall be

   constructed and installed at the Owner/Developer’s sole expense, prior to

   issuance of the first Certificate of Occupancy within the subject BPUD.

   Saxon Boulevard is a Volusia County road and Volusia County will be

   required to issue a use permit for activity within the Saxon Boulevard

   right-of-way for driveway and mast arm traffic signal work. The City and

   the Owner/Developer will coordinate with Volusia County to implement

   the access and traffic management elements of this Agreement. In the

   event that the Owner/Developer has diligently taken all actions required

   hereunder to obtain a use permit from Volusia County for the installation

   of the mast arm traffic signal (as reasonably determined by the City of

   Deltona), but Volusia County has not issued such a use permit, the

   Owner/Developer may escrow with the City of Deltona the full cost of

   such mast arm traffic signal and installation thereof, in order to obtain the

   issuance of the first Certificate of Occupancy within the subject BPUD. In

   addition, Lot 3 of the SRV PUD is in no way obligated to build, bond, or

   otherwise make any fair share contribution to the construction of the

   traffic signal, so long as the traffic signal is constructed as provided in this

                                                                      Page 8 of 27

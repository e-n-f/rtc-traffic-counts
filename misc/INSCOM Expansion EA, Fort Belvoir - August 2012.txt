TITLE OF PROPOSED ACTION: Environmental Assessment for Expansion of U.S. Army
Intelligence and Security Command Headquarters Facilities at U.S. Army Garrison Fort Belvoir,
Virginia

AFFECTED JURISDICTION: Fairfax County, Virginia

PREPARED BY: AECOM, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia in association with Carter's Run Environmental
Corporation, Inc., LPES, Inc., and Dewberry & Davis, LLC.

APPROVED BY: Colonel Gregory D. Gadson, Commander, U.S. Army Garrison Fort Belvoir, Virginia

ABSTRACT: This environmental assessment (EA) evaluates the impacts of renovating and expanding
the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command headquarters building, constructing a parking garage,
and rebuilding surface parking lots and interior roadways at U.S. Army Garrison Fort Belvoir, Virginia. A
No Action Alternative (No Build Alternative) is also evaluated to serve as a baseline against which the
impacts of the proposed action are evaluated. None of the predicted effects of the proposed action would
result in significant impacts at Fort Belvoir. Mitigation measures and best management practices would
be employed to reduce or minimize impacts. Therefore, preparation of an Environmental Impact
Statement is not required and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) will be published in accordance
with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).

REVIEW PERIOD: Interested parties are invited to review and comment on the EA and draft FNSI
within 30 days of publication. Please submit any comments to Commander, U.S. Army Garrison Fort
Belvoir, ATTN: Public Works, 9430 Jackson Loop, Suite 100, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5116 or e-mail
your comments to imcom.fortbelvoir.dpw.environmental@us.army.mil. For further information, contact
Mr. Patrick McLaughlin, Chief of Environmental and Natural Resources Division, at (703) 806-4007.

Executive Summary 

The US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) proposes to renovate and expand
its headquarters on US Army Garrison Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The Proposed Action would
include: renovating and adding to the existing HQINSCOM building; erecting a new multi-
storied parking garage; reconfiguring surface parking lots, landscaping, walkways, and
roadways; and adding new utilities infrastructure, including stormwater management. Fort
Belvoir has prepared this environmental assessment (EA) to publicly document the
environmental consequences of the proposed action. The EA has been prepared pursuant to the
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Part 1500-1508, AR 200-2 and 32 CFR Part 651.

The purpose of the proposed action is to provide increased space for personnel and equipment
performing INSCOM Headquarters (HQINSCOM) intelligence missions. The need for the
project is to: consolidate headquarters personnel now located in commercial rental space off of
Fort Belvoir or in other facilities on Fort Belvoir to increase security and efficiency; provide
increased and more flexible space for personnel and equipment performing headquarters
intelligence missions to relieve current overcrowding; and ensure that the facilities meet current
anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) standards.



ES.1  Alternatives  
INSCOM considered the following alternative approaches to providing more space for existing
and future HQINSCOM employees:

       Implementing the Proposed Action.
       Building a completely new headquarters facility somewhere else on Fort Belvoir.
       Making minor renovations to the current HQINSCOM Nolan Building.
       Leasing long-term space off-Post.
       Doing nothing ("the No Action" alternative).

Of these alternatives, only the Proposed Action would meet INSCOM's needs in a reasonable
manner. The No Action Alternative is not reasonable and would not meet INSCOM's needs, but
it is addressed in this EA because it provides a baseline against which to compare the impacts of
the Proposed Action.

                               




                                              ES-1                      Environmental Assessment 
EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


ES.2 Proposed Action 
Implementing the Proposed Action would add approximately 890 workers to the HQINSCOM
building, increasing workers from approximately 1,650 to a total of approximately 2,540.
Approximately 575 of the personnel to be relocated are currently in leased space about 10 miles
from Fort Belvoir in Springfield, Virginia. Another 255 are working on Fort Belvoir in three
different buildings. Additionally, the new space would accommodate 80 full-time personnel in
the future as INSCOM's mission expands. The Proposed Action would also accommodate
personnel who attend training and conferences at HQINSCOM.

The Proposed Action includes:

       Renovating the existing 234,000-square-foot HQINSCOM Nolan Building.
       Constructing a new 382,000-square-foot addition to the existing HQINSCOM Nolan
       Building.
       Constructing a 1,420-space parking structure.
       Reconfiguring and reconstructing the surface parking lots, landscaping, roadways, and
       sidewalks on site. Surface parking would total 586 spaces.
       Constructing new utilities and a new stormwater management/best management practice
       pond.

The long-term reconfiguration of the surface parking lots at HQINSCOM would result in 2,006
parking spaces onsite, including 1,524 employee, 446 visitor and student, and 36 government
surface parking spaces.



ES.3 Land Use  
The new, denser complex would be consistent with the existing pattern of clustered development
and land uses that characterize Fort Belvoir's upper North Post. The Proposed Action would
have a target Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) goal of silver. The
proposed action would be consistent to the maximum extent possible with the Virginia Coastal
Resources Management Program. The ratio of employee parking spaces to employees, projected
to be 60 percent, would be better than the National Capital Planning Commission's (NCPC)
target parking goal of 67 percent, and consistent with the US Army's goal of 60 percent.

The expansion areas would largely be confined to the existing footprint of the complex. An
exception is along the eastern edge and the southeastern corner of the site where the new
building addition and service road would project into forested area designated as "natural
constraints" because it is part of the Fort Belvoir Forest and Wildlife Corridor. To mitigate this
change, INSCOM would remove the pavement and invasive vegetation from an equivalent area
(0.34 acres) at the northeast corner of the project site, and plant native trees. The Army would
then designate this restored area as part of the Forest and Wildlife Corridor.

ES.4 Transportation and Traffic 
When fully implemented in 2018, the Proposed Action would contribute to an increase in traffic
volumes and delays near HQINSCOM as more personnel commute to the site. However, the
levels-of-service (LOS) for the three nearby intersections studied are today and would remain
acceptable after implementation of the Proposed Action. Analysis of 2018 traffic conditions
assumed a reduction in single-occupant vehicle use by Fort Belvoir's commuters from 85 percent
to 75 percent in line with Fort Belvoir's draft Transportation Management Program. The Fairfax
County Parkway / John J. Kingman Road / Farrar Road intersection currently operates at LOS C
in the morning peak period and LOS D in the evening peak. Under both 2018 No Build (2018
conditions without the Proposed Action) and Build (with the Proposed Action) conditions,
morning and peak periods would operate at LOS D with increased delays averaging less than
five seconds. The Farrar Road leg of the intersection would be most affected because the lower
volume of traffic commands less green time. The Telegraph Road/Beulah Street intersection,
currently LOS C in the morning peak and LOS D in the evening peak, would improve to LOS C
in both peaks under both 2018 No Build and Build conditions because the intersection will be
improved to accommodate the new Hilltop Village Center (traffic from the center was not
factored into this analysis but is not expected to affect the outcome). The John J. Kingman /
Beulah Street intersection, more lightly used but closest to HQINSCOM, currently operates at
LOS B in both periods. In 2018 in both periods under both the Build and No Build conditions, it
would operate at LOS C. No mitigation is necessary.



ES.5 Air Quality and Utilities  
Construction and operation of the expansion would generate air emissions, but these would be
minor for both the short and long term. Similarly, the Proposed Action would increase the
demand for utilities, but the increase is well within the capacity of the existing infrastructure with
a few improvements/modifications (e.g., the existing sanitary lift stations, pumps, and lines and
potable water lines would be upgraded and/or relocated to handle the additional demand).
Stormwater from the northern parking lots that is presently flowing to Mason Run without the
benefit of retention and treatment would be captured and treated in a new stormwater
management pond.



ES.6 Socioeconomics, Environmental Justice and the Protection of 
     Children 
The Proposed Action would have no effect on area or regional populations ­ 255 of the
personnel already work in other buildings on Fort Belvoir, and the 575 personnel moving from
leased space in Springfield already live in the area. Therefore, the move would not affect their
current place of residence. The Proposed Action has little potential to disproportionately affect
minority or low income populations, or populations of children ­ there are no residential areas
near the HQINSCOM compound and no concentrations of children.

EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


ES.7 Natural Resources  
Construction of the parking garage and additional roadways would cover 4.3 acres of permeable
soils with pavement or other impermeable surfaces. Clearing and grading for construction would
cause short-term erosion and sedimentation and minor localized changes in soil infiltration rates
and surface runoff patterns. Because the proposed project would affect more than 2,500 square
feet of land, an erosion and sediment control plan employing soil best management practices, and
a Virginia Stormwater Management Program permit would be required for the clearing and
grading activities.

Construction would affect 4.6 acres of forest habitat, of which 0.34 acres is part of the Fort
Belvoir Forest and Wildlife Corridor which connects natural areas within and beyond the Post.
The building itself would not intrude into the corridor, but the perimeter road would intrude as
would grading along the eastern edge of the site. The project would impact approximately 3.26
acres of breeding habitat ­ mainly forest but some grassland ­ for Partners in Flight (PIF) bird
species. INSCOM has made every effort to limit these impacts, and would restore an equivalent
area of the FWC by removing pavement from, grading, and planting the northeast corner of the
existing parking lot. INSCOM will also remove asphalt pavement from, add topsoil, and plant
trees on several sites at or in the vicinity of INSCOM, as well as remove invasive foreign
vegetation from the FWC adjacent to the project area. These actions would also replace PIF
habitat.

The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage, by letter
dated November 17, 2009, indicated that the project was unlikely to impact any protected plant
or animal species or natural area preserves. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, by letter dated
December 22, 2009, indicated the same. Because several years have passed since this previous
coordination, Fort Belvoir has sent new coordination letters to these agencies, as well as to the
Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. Responses from the agencies will be
incorporated into the final draft of this EA; however, no impacts on these resources are
anticipated. Additionally, Fort Belvoir has also conducted recent surveys for the small whorled
pogonia (Isotria medeoloides) and wood turtle (Glyptemys insculptata). None were found.

The proposed peripheral road for the expanded building would encroach on the Chesapeake Bay
Resource Protection Area (RPA) associated with the small pond of the existing building by
approximately 1,672 square feet, which would not require mitigation. However, the mitigation
measures to be implemented for the loss of forest habitat and the FWC ­ removing asphalt
pavement, adding topsoil, planting trees, and removing invasive vegetation ­ would also mitigate
for this encroachment on the RPA.



ES.8 Cumulative Impacts  
The Department of Defense Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 agency and personnel
realignments at Fort Belvoir involved approximately 20 construction projects and 12,800
workers being realigned to Fort Belvoir between 2008 and 2011. The 2005 BRAC realigned

approximately 19,000 workers to Fort Belvoir, but approximately 6,200 of those 19,000 workers
were moved to new office space being constructed on Seminary Road in Alexandria, Virginia.
The cumulative impacts of these projects and personnel moves were addressed in the 2007 Fort
Belvoir BRAC EIS and Record of Decision (ROD) (USACE 2007, College 2007).

Concurrent construction projects in the same area of the Post could lead to increases in vehicle
traffic, air emissions, and noise from the various construction activities. Three projects in
proximity to the HQINSCOM site and likely to overlap in time are: the ongoing construction of
the new Post Exchange and Commissary along Gunston Road, scheduled for completion in 2013
and 2015; construction of the National Museum of the US Army off the Fairfax County
Parkway, just north of its intersection with John J. Kingman Road (including the construction of
several new holes for the North Post Golf course to replace holes that are being impacted by
construction of the NMUSA); and, the widening of Route 1 from Telegraph Road through the
installation to the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway. This project, which is being done by the
Federal Highway Administration's Eastern Federal Lands Team in cooperation with Fort Belvoir
and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), is currently being bid, and is scheduled
to be completed in 2016. The cumulative impacts of the proposed action when considered with
these other three projects would be both short-term and long-term, but would be minor.

Plans and/or rezoning applications have been approved or are in process for:

       A proposed plan to construct up to 470 multi-family and single-family housing units; up
       to 55,000 sq ft of retail space; and up to 16,000 sq ft of office space at the current
       location of Accotink Village.
       Expansion of the Belvoir Business Park on Lorton Station Boulevard near the
       northwestern corner of the Post to include office and/or industrial use.
       The proposed Hilltop Village Center mixed use development at the intersection of Beulah
       Street and Telegraph Road, potentially including a 150,000 SF grocery story; 94,000 SF
       of specialty retail and banks; over 100,000 SF of office space; and parking.
       The redevelopment of the Northern Virginia Industrial Park on Telegraph Road West as a
       mixed use development. A Fairfax County Comprehensive Plan Amendment allows the
       land to become a mix of office, hotel, retail, civic, and light industrial uses.

The County Board also amended the Transportation Plan to show Telegraph Road planned for
six lanes (formerly four-lanes) from Richmond Highway to Fairfax County Parkway. Together
these projects have the potential to add to local traffic congestion over the short and long term,
but impacts would be minor.



ES.9 Resources Not Evaluated in This Environmental Assessment 
Consistent with 40 CFR 1501.7(a)(3), the following resources were not considered in depth in
this EA because the proposed action would have no or negligible potential impact on them:




                                              ES-5                      Environmental Assessment
EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


       Cultural Resources: There are no historic architectural resources on the INSCOM
       compound, and the two archaeological sites (44FX1095 and 44FX1275) identified are not
       eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
       Wetlands: The only wetland on the site is a small forested wetland adjacent to the
       perennial stream that exits the existing pond south of the existing building. The project
       would not impact this area.
       Floodplains: There are no 100-year floodplains on the site.
       Noise: Long-term operation of the facility would have little if any impact on the noise
       environment at Fort Belvoir.
       Community Facilities: Because the proposed action is unlikely to cause an influx of new
       residents, the Army has not addressed impacts on schools or hospital services in this EA.


ES.10 Conclusion  
In summary, this EA describes and identifies the potential impacts of the Proposed Action
Alternative and the No Action Alternative. The Proposed Action would not have a significant
impact on the quality of the human environment and an environmental impact statement (EIS) is
not needed.

1      PURPOSE AND NEED 

US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) proposes to renovate and expand its
headquarters facilities (HQINSCOM) on US Army Garrison Fort Belvoir, Virginia. INSCOM
plans to:

       Build a new multi-storied parking garage.
       Build an addition to the existing HQINSCOM building.
       Renovate the HQINSCOM building.
       Reconfigure existing surface parking lots, landscaping, walkways, and roadways.
       Build new utilities infrastructure and a new stormwater management/best management
       practice (SWM/BMP) pond.

INSCOM is a major Army command, responsible for conducting intelligence, security, and
information operations for military commanders and national decision makers. INSCOM
conducts a wide range of intelligence production activities and has major responsibilities in the
areas of counterintelligence and force protection, electronic warfare and information warfare,
and support to force modernization and training.



1.1 Purpose and Need for the Proposed Action  
The purpose of the proposed action is to provide increased space for personnel and equipment
performing INSCOM intelligence missions. In addition to relieving overcrowding of the current
workforce at HQINSCOM, and allowing consolidation of workers from HQINSCOM elements
that are presently in leased space, the proposed action would enable HQINSCOM to
accommodate a projected increase in staff.

The renovation of the existing building is needed not only to provide new space for incoming
personnel, but also to provide for more flexible working space. INSCOM needs to be able to
reconfigure work stations as mission and personnel team needs change. The HQINSCOM
building was constructed in 1989 using now-outdated interior design criteria. For example, eight
(8)-inch (in) concrete walls were used to partition interior space into various secure areas, and
drywall partitions were used to separate work stations. This type of construction does not allow
for efficient reconfiguration as needs change.

The renovation would provide fewer permanent private offices and fewer permanently-
partitioned spaces. The expansion and renovation would reclaim space required for circulation
among offices and other workspace, and would free up space for conference and training areas
adjacent to personnel work stations. It would also restore the loading dock ­ now obstructed ­ to
its primary function.


                                              1-1                       Environmental Assessment 
EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


The proposed renovations would upgrade the HQINSCOM building and site to meet the most
recent antiterrorism/force protection (AT/FP) standards, including increasing standoff distances
and ensuring that all windows, metal-framed skylights, and entryways are equipped with AT/FP-
compliant glazing systems.

Expansion would also allow certain INSCOM elements to move from leased space outside of
Fort Belvoir and elements located in other facilities on Fort Belvoir to join other personnel
currently at the HQINSCOM building. Without consolidation, the currently disjointed operations
will continue to impede Army-wide information operations. The continued high cost of leasing
off-Post space will continue to impose a burden on INSCOM's resources and tax dollars.
Personnel will remain in overcrowded conditions that lower performance and efficiency, and
INSCOM will be unable to implement the latest technology and achieve the full potential of its
capabilities (USAINSCOM, 2006). In addition, moving all personnel on-Post would increase
their security.

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, Fort Belvoir has
prepared this environmental assessment (EA) to publicly document the environmental
consequences of the proposed action. The EA has been prepared pursuant to the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1500-
1508, 32 CFR Part 651, and Army Regulations AR 200-2.



1.2 Location and Background  
Fort Belvoir is located in southeastern Fairfax County, Virginia, approximately 18 miles (mi)
southwest of Washington, DC (Figure 1, Location of Fort Belvoir). Fort Belvoir includes the
7,682-acre (ac) Main Post and the 807-ac North Area (FBNA, formerly called the Engineer
Proving Ground) (Figure 2, Fort Belvoir). Fort Belvoir Main Post lies between Interstate-95 and
Pohick Bay and Gunston Cove on the Potomac River. US Route 1 divides Main Post into North
Post and South Post.

In recent years, Fort Belvoir has functioned as an administrative and logistics support center for
the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Army and as a host for over 140 tenant organizations.
Fort Belvoir also provides support services (hospital, dental, recreational, etc.) for over 200,000
military personnel, dependents, and retirees in the region. Implementation of the DoD's Base
Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 realignment actions at Fort Belvoir has resulted in a
number of new facilities and new personnel. Personnel working on Fort Belvoir's Main Post and
North Area currently total approximately 39,000. About 7,000 residents live on the Post.

HQINSCOM is located on Fort Belvoir's North Post, southeast of the intersection of John J.
Kingman Road and Beulah Street. The HQINSCOM site covers approximately 45 ac, of which
approximately 23 ac are developed.

Environmental Assessment                       1-6
                                                       EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


1.3 The NEPA Process  
NEPA provides for the consideration of environmental issues in federal agency planning and
decision-making. Under NEPA and 32 CFR Part 651, the Army must prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) or an EA for any federal action, except those actions that are determined
to be exempt by law, "emergencies," or "categorically excluded." An EIS is prepared for those
federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. An EA is a
concise public document that provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether
to prepare an EIS. The EA includes a brief discussion of:

       The need for the proposal.
       The alternatives (as required under Section 102 (2)(E) of NEPA).
       The environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed action and alternatives.
       A listing of agencies and persons consulted.

The EA results in either a Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to
prepare an EIS. An evaluation of the environmental consequences of the proposed action and
alternatives includes direct, indirect, and cumulative effects as defined at 40 CFR 1508.7 and
1508.8, as well as qualitative and quantitative (where possible) assessment of the level of
significance of these effects. If Fort Belvoir determines that the proposed action may have a
significant impact on the quality of the human environment, then an EIS will be prepared.



1.4 Resources Not Evaluated in This Environmental Assessment 
Consistent with 40 CFR 1501.7(a)(3), the following resources are not considered further in this
EA because the proposed action would have no potential impact on them:

       Cultural Resources: Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), as
       amended, requires federal agencies to integrate consideration of historic preservation
       issues into the early stages of their planning projects. There are no historic architectural
       resources on the INSCOM compound ­ the existing HQINSCOM building was
       constructed in 1989 and does not qualify for listing under the criteria in 36 CFR 60.4. At
       that time, most of the site was disturbed by construction and paved or covered with
       structures. Nonetheless, two archaeological sites are present at the edge of the
       HQINSCOM site (44FX1095 and 44FX1275). The Virginia State Historic Preservation
       Office (SHPO) concurred in letters dated July 20, 2005 and May 30, 2006, and by e-mail
       dated April 3, 2012 that these sites are not eligible for listing on the National Register of
       Historic Places. Fort Belvoir also coordinated the project with the Catawba Indian Nation
       Tribal Historic Preservation Office, who replied by letter dated April 11, 2012, that the
       Tribe had no immediate concerns with regard to traditional cultural properties, sacred
       sites, or Native American archaeological sites within the boundaries of the proposed
       project area, but asked to be contacted if Native American artifacts or human remains
       were encountered during ground disturbance for this project. Copies of these

       letters/emails are in Appendix B. Therefore, no significant cultural resources occur on the
       HQINSCOM site.

       Floodplains: The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection
       Act of 1973, and Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management ­ administered by the
       Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) ­ set forth the responsibilities of
       federal agencies in reducing the risk of flood loss or damage to personal property,
       minimizing the impact of flood loss, and restoring the natural and beneficial functions of
       floodplains. There are no floodplains designated on FEMA's National Flood Insurance
       Program mapping on the site. The nearest mapped floodplain is immediately east of the
       site adjacent to Mason Run, at the base of the steep slopes which separate the
       HQINSCOM site from the stream.

       Wetlands: Wetlands are regulated by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the
       US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and state agencies as "waters of the US"
       under Sections 402 and 404 of the Clean Water Act. Fort Belvoir conducted a wetland
       delineation of the HQINSCOM site (Paciulli, Simmons & Associates, Ltd., 2011). The
       only vegetated wetland within the limits of disturbance is a small forested wetland
       adjacent to the perennial stream that exits the existing pond on the south part of the site.
       The project would not impact this area.

       Noise: The Noise Control Act of 1972 (PL 92-574) directs federal agencies to comply
       with applicable federal, state, interstate, and local noise control regulations. The Fairfax
       County Code prohibits the creation of sound louder than 55 decibels (dB) in a residential
       area, and 60 dB in a commercial area. It also prohibits the creation of any excessive noise
       on any street adjacent to any school, institution of learning, court, or hospital that
       interferes with its function (Fairfax County Code Section 108-4-1). Construction and
       demolition activities are, however, exempt from the Fairfax County ordinance provided
       they occur between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. The construction and renovation activities
       would require use of heavy equipment that would generate short-term increases in noise
       at the HQINSCOM site. However, this area of the Post is 2,000 feet from the nearest
       residential area (Accotink Village) and is already dominated by noise from aircraft
       overflights from the Davison Army Airfield. The short-term increases in noise from
       construction machinery would not be noticed off-site. Long-term operation of the facility
       would have little if any impact on the noise environment at Fort Belvoir. Fairfax County
       Code does not specifically address occasional noise sources such as emergency
       generators. However, the distance from the nearest residential area and the sporadic and
       short-term nature of the generators' use would generate minimal impacts.

       Community Facilities: Because the proposed action is unlikely to cause an influx of new
       residents moving into the area, the Army has not addressed impacts on schools or
       hospital services in this EA. Personnel moving to the HQINSCOM site either already
       work in buildings other than HQINSCOM on Fort Belvoir or work 10 mi away in leased
       space. Few of these personnel are likely to change their place of residence based on these
       relatively small changes in their commuting trip to and from their place of work.

2      DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED ACTION AND 
       ALTERNATIVES 

CEQ's Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental
Policy Act establish a number of policies for federal agencies, including "...using the NEPA
process to identify and assess the reasonable alternatives to the proposed action that will avoid or
minimize adverse effects of these actions on the quality of the human environment" (40 CFR
1500.2 [e]). INSCOM has considered the following alternative approaches to providing more
space for existing and future HQINSCOM employees:

       Implementing the Proposed Action to renovate and add space to the HQINSCOM's
       Nolan Building and to add parking.
       Building a complete new headquarters facility somewhere else on Fort Belvoir.
       Making minor renovations to the current HQINSCOM Nolan Building.
       Leasing long-term space off-Post.
       Doing nothing ("the No Action" Alternative).

In order for an alternative to be reasonable, it must fulfill the purpose and need for the Proposed
Action. For this Proposed Action, the purpose is to provide increased space for personnel and
equipment performing INSCOM intelligence missions. The Proposed Action is driven by the
need to:

       Provide sufficient space to accommodate recent increases in HQINSCOM personnel and
       to allow them to carry out their mission effectively.
       Accommodate all HQINSCOM personnel in one building in order to optimize efficiency
       and functional relationships among user groups and minimize security risks.
       Ensure that HQINSCOM facilities meet current anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP)
       standards.

Only those alternatives that are reasonable and able to fulfill the purpose and need for the action
warrant a detailed environmental analysis.



2.1 Proposed Action  
The Proposed Action is a multi-year construction project programmed to occur from Fiscal
Years (FY) 2012 to 2018. The project accommodates the consolidation and expansion of current
and future INSCOM personnel and missions. Once the final phase of the project has been
completed in FY 2018, the number of INSCOM personnel working in the Nolan Building would
have increased by approximately 890 workers ­ from approximately 1,650 (including 175 shift


                                                2-1                       Environmental Assessment

workers who work evenings and weekends) at present to a total of approximately 2,540 in FY18.
The new space would accommodate approximately 575 personnel currently working in leased
space at Metro Park in Springfield, VA about 10 mi from Fort Belvoir and approximately 255
personnel who are working elsewhere on Fort Belvoir. HQINSCOM also currently has the
capacity to accommodate up to 350 personnel for training at any one time, and this capacity
would be replicated in the new space.

Figure 3 (HQINSCOM ­ Existing Site Layout) shows the existing conditions at the HQINSCOM
site. Figure 4 (HQINSCOM ­ Proposed Expansion) shows the conceptual plan for the Proposed
Action. Figures 4a through 4d show the Proposed Action's four construction phases. The
Proposed Action's construction phases would include:

       Phase 1: constructing a five-story parking structure with up to 1,420 spaces, access roads,
       sidewalks, a stormwater retention pond, retaining walls (along the north side of the
       proposed parking structure and around the retention pond), and reconfiguring existing
       surface parking areas and landscaping.

       During construction, about half the existing surface parking area between the Nolan
       Building and the proposed parking structure would be needed for staging construction
       equipment and materials. INSCOM would construct a temporary parking area onsite (on
       landscaped areas north and west of the Nolan Building), and the Post would provide
       temporary parking at other locations on the Post to compensate for lost spaces. Shuttle
       buses would ferry employees between these parking areas and the Nolan Building. The
       temporary parking locations would most likely include:

           o   The Mosby Center on North Post (approximately 120 spaces).
           o   The North Post Chapel (approximately 58 spaces).
           o   The vacant lot next to the North Post Chapel (approximately 28 spaces).
           o   Approximately 106 spaces at the McRee Barracks (North Post) main parking lot.
           o   Up to 65 spaces in the Army and Air Force Exchange Service parking lot, near
               where the Car Care Center (CCC) will be located, with the exact number
               dependent on when the CCC opens.

       These temporary parking spaces would be used while Phase 1 is under construction, until
       early 2015.

       Phase 1 would also include construction of a central utility building located with the
       proposed new parking garage, a construction entrance, installation of traffic control
       devices within the HQINSCOM roadway network, as needed; reconfiguration of the main
       entrance road; and, demolition of site features such as the parking area where the
       proposed parking structure would be located, and curbs and gutters as needed to provide
       construction access.

       Phase 2: constructing two basement levels and the ground level for a new addition to the
       Nolan Building. The addition would be approximately 188,000 square feet, and include a
       sensitive compartmented intelligence facility (SCIF), administrative areas, specialized
       operations space, special equipment storage, a server room, and a generator.

       Phase 3: constructing three more levels (approximately 194,000 square feet) of the
       building addition, including the SCIF, administrative area, classrooms, a server room, a
       wellness center, a shower, and a cafeteria. Approximately 30 percent of the new building
       will be equipped with a green roof, and another 30 percent with a roof top garden.

       Phase 4: renovating the existing 234,000-square-foot Nolan Building and completing any
       remaining site work.

Site work such as reconfiguring and reconstructing the surface parking lots, landscaping,
roadways, sidewalks, utilities and stormwater management best management practices would
proceed as needed during the first three phases. A turning lane would be constructed on Beulah
Street from the site entrance to John J. Kingman Road during Phase 1 to accommodate traffic as
workers are moved from leased space off-Post and other parts of the Post to the site.

The long-term reconfiguration of the surface parking lots at HQINSCOM would result in 2,006
parking spaces onsite, including 1,524 employee, 446 visitor and student, and 36 government
surface parking spaces.

The new addition and the renovated, existing Nolan Building would function as a single building
(throughout this document, the addition is referenced as the "new building," "proposed
building," or "addition.") This approach would not only optimize the functional relationships
among all HQINSCOM groups, but also would allow phased moves of personnel and equipment
from the existing building into the new building and the incremental remodeling of the existing
building. There would be minimal disruption of operations.

The proposed building addition would include operations space, special equipment storage areas,
classrooms, office and administrative space, a server room, a wellness room and showers, and a
cafeteria. Working space would extend two floors below grade, requiring excavation.

In the old building, concrete walls used to partition the interior space into secure areas and
drywall partitions would be demolished and replaced by fewer partitioned areas and fewer
private offices. In addition to replacing windows, skylights, and glassed entryways with blast-
resistant AT/FP glazing, air intake systems would be protected. Intrusion and access control
features would be incorporated into the design. The new structure would incorporate non-
progressive collapse design, and window, entrance and curtain-wall reinforcement. The
reconfiguration of access roads and parking lots would increase the clear zone between vehicles
and the buildings for blast protection, and include vehicle entry control.

The new building would receive emergency back-up power from two new energy efficient
2,250-kilowatt generators (most likely employing Open Loop Selective Catalytic Reduction),
with one generator to be installed during Phase I and one generator installed as part of Phase 2.


                                              2-11                      Environmental Assessment
EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


In addition, the generators providing back-up power for the existing Nolan Building would be
replaced with Open Loop Selective Catalytic Reduction or similarly-efficient generators during
Phases 3 and 4 of the project. The generators for the new building would be located in the new
central utility building to be co-located with the proposed parking structure.

Consistent with Army policy, the new INSCOM facilities will achieve the Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design-New Construction (LEED-NC) silver rating criteria for sustainable
design. In addition to incorporating energy efficient strategies into the overall design, the
designers are examining ways to incorporate low impact design (LID) measures into the site
design.

The project has been designed to comply to the maximum extent possible with Executive Order
13514, Federal Leadership in Environment, Energy, and Economic Performance, which directs
federal agencies to "lead by example" in addressing a wide range of environmental issues. The
current DoD criterion is that buildings be constructed to consume 40 percent less energy than the
baseline consumption rate of a building constructed in accordance with American Society for
Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2007. This
project would fall short of those goals because of the nature of the INSCOM mission, which
requires more power consumption for computer equipment than a normal building (INSCOM,
2011a). As a result, the project will require Army approval as an exception to the energy
standard. In the meantime, INSCOM is evaluating strategies to further reduce energy
consumption. For example, solar radiation would be used to heat a substantial portion of the new
and renovated buildings. However, this measure alone would not be sufficient, and supplemental
heating sources would be needed.

Implementation of the Proposed Action Alternative would meet all project requirements listed on
page 2-1. Therefore, this alternative meets the purpose and need for the project and is a
reasonable alternative.



2.2 Alternatives Considered but Dismissed 
2.2.1    Build New Facility on Fort Belvoir 

INSCOM considered constructing a completely new headquarters facility, including buildings,
parking, and utilities on a different Fort Belvoir site. While this alternative would meet the
project requirements listed on page 2-1, the alternative presented the following difficulties:

        The scarcity of sites on Fort Belvoir large enough to accommodate a complex of this size,
        able to accommodate 2,540 workers, and consistent with the approved Real Property
        Master Plan Long-Range Component (Subchapter 3.1.1). Most developable land with no
        environmental constraints on Fort Belvoir has already been developed or is being planned
        for future development as part of the current Real Property Master Plan process
        (Subchapter 3.9).



Environmental Assessment                      2-12
                                                        EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


        An increase in overall cost of at least 65 to 70 percent to build anew on an undeveloped
        site. Even if a site of sufficient size exists, the construction of a completely new facility
        could cause far greater environmental impacts if, unlike the INSCOM site, the new site is
        presently undisturbed.
        If a redevelopment site of sufficient size were used, an even greater cost would be likely
        ­ the site would require demolition of existing buildings and potential remediation
        measures.

For these reasons, INSCOM dropped the concept of constructing a new complex on Fort Belvoir
from further consideration, and this alternative is not considered further in this EA.


2.2.2    Minor Renovations of HQINSCOM Nolan Building  

INSCOM also considered making minor modifications to improve space utilization within the
existing Nolan Building on the HQINSCOM site. It would be a "quick fix" attempt to
accommodate more personnel in the building by:

        Adding, moving, and removing wall partitions.
        Reducing the size of workstations and office areas to increase the number of personnel
        that could be accommodated.
        Converting meeting rooms and common areas into workstation areas.
        Increasing the capacity of infrastructure, especially utility systems, to accommodate
        added workstations and mission equipment.

This alternative is not reasonable because the capacity of the Nolan Building is already being
exceeded, and the changes would not provide sufficient space to accommodate all HQINSCOM
personnel and equipment, let alone in one building in a manner that contributes to mission
effectiveness. This alternative would not meet the purpose and need for the proposed action and
is not considered further in this EA.


2.2.3    LongTerm Lease OffPost 

INSCOM currently leases commercial space in Alexandria on a temporary basis. This alternative
would increase the amount of commercial space needed on a long-term basis to accommodate
the increase in personnel and equipment, while still maintaining most personnel in the current
Nolan Building. To meet the increasingly stringent AT/FP, physical security, access control, and
communications infrastructure requirements, this alternative would require a commercial venture
to construct a new facility or extensively renovate an existing facility. Constructing such a
secure, fenced facility on commercial real estate in the Washington DC metropolitan area is cost
prohibitive. Because of the nature of much of its mission, INSCOM's space requirements
preclude leasing most typical existing commercial spaces without costly modifications to ensure
protection of classified information.



                                                2-13                       Environmental Assessment
EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


Given the commercial market right now (2012), there is probably plenty of commercial space
available and many owners who would be willing to make the modifications. However, it is also
likely that the building owner/manager would require a long-term lease (ten years or more), and
this might make it difficult to accommodate future mission and/or personnel changes. This
alternative would not meet the need to reduce costs of leasing or to consolidate personnel for
more efficient and secure operations. Personnel in the leased space would continue to be
separated from the personnel in the HQINSCOM Nolan Building and work in a less secure
setting. Information security would be more difficult to maintain. Therefore, this alternative is
not considered further in this EA.


2.2.4    No Action Alternative 

The No Action Alternative represents the status quo. Under this alternative, the HQINSCOM
Nolan Building would not be renovated other than for routine maintenance, an addition to the
building would not be built, AT/FP elements would not be upgraded, HQINSCOM personnel
would remain separated in two different facilities, and personnel now working in the Nolan
Building would continue to work in cramped conditions that affect their ability to carry out their
mission.

This alternative does not meet any of the requirements for this project articulated on page 2-1
and would not meet the purpose or need for the proposed action. Nevertheless, the No Action
alternative is evaluated in this EA in accordance with CEQ guidance to serve as a baseline
against which to measure impacts.

3       AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND 
        ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 

The CEQ regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR Part 1500) require documentation succinctly
describing the environment of the area(s) to be affected by the alternatives under consideration,
as well as a discussion of the impacts in proportion to their significance. The affected
environment under the Proposed Action Alternative(s) ranges from site-specific physical and
natural resources to broader regional concerns (i.e., air quality variables, noise, infrastructure,
socioeconomic conditions, community facilities and services, transportation and traffic).



3.1 Land Use, Plans, and Coastal Zone Management  
3.1.1    Land Use 

Existing Conditions: Fort Belvoir is approximately 8,500 acres in size; approximately 65
percent of this land is undeveloped, much of it due to environmental constraints. The Post is
divided into five areas: North Post, South Post, the Southwest Area, the Davison Army Airfield,
and the Fort Belvoir North Area (FBNA - formerly called the Engineer Proving Ground). The
North and South Posts are separated by US Route 1, which bisects the Post and is a major
transportation corridor in this part of Virginia. The North and South Posts contain most of the
development at Fort Belvoir.

Figure 5 (Land Use) shows Fort Belvoir's designated land use categories on and surrounding the
HQINSCOM site. The HQINSCOM site is located in the upper part of North Post. Development
in the upper North Post is clustered and of moderate to low density. Because of the presence of
numerous environmental constraints, developed areas are not contiguous, and occur in the form
of separate, fenced compounds or campuses, with associated support structures such as parking
lots and parking garages. The HQINSCOM site is presently designated for professional/
institutional land use, as are the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense
Logistics Agency (DLA) immediately west of Beulah Street.

The HQINSCOM site is bounded by a forested valley to the north and steep-sided, forested
stream valleys associated with Mason Run to the east and south. Mason Run and its associated
wetlands and Chesapeake Bay Resource Protection Area (RPA; described in Section 3.7.6) and
the Fort Belvoir Forest and Wildlife Corridor (FWC) (described in Section 3.7.4) (Figure 6,
Natural Constraints on Development) are designated in the Fort Belvoir Real Property Master
Plan as "natural constraints on development." These protected areas separate the HQINSCOM
site from John J. Kingman Road to the north, Keene Road (a little-used dirt road) and Gunston
Road to the east, and Abbot and Stuart Roads to the south. Another small gravel access road
south of the existing building currently intrudes into the Chesapeake Bay RPA.


                                               3-1                       Environmental Assessment
EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


The HQINSCOM compound is located within the Building Height Restriction Zone associated
with Davison Army Airfield. The height restriction in this area is 216 feet (ft) absolute elevation.
The existing HQINSCOM building does not exceed this threshold.

Impacts of No Action: The No Action Alternative would have no impact on current land uses
on the Post. Existing conditions at the HQINSCOM compound would continue for the
foreseeable future.

Impacts of the Proposed Action / Mitigation: The Proposed Action would rearrange the
configuration of buildings, parking, roadways and other features on site, but no new functions or
uses would be introduced at the site. The expansion areas would largely be confined to the
existing footprint of the complex except for the proposed parking garage and a proposed access
road along the east and south sides of the new building. These facilities would encroach on
forested habitat, the FWC, and the Chesapeake Bay RPA to varying degrees, with the largest
encroachment on forested habitat and the smallest encroachment on the Chesapeake Bay RPA.
These impacts are addressed in Subchapter 3.7, and shown in Figures 6 and 16. Otherwise, the
denser, new complex would be consistent with the existing pattern of clustered development that
characterizes the upper North Post, and the Proposed Action would have no impact on existing
land use. The proposed new structures would not exceed the threshold height of 216 feet
(absolute elevation).


3.1.2     Plans  

3.1.2.1    Fort Belvoir Real Property Master Plan 

Existing Conditions: In 2007 in response to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
process, the Army updated and amended the land use plan in Fort Belvoir's 1993 Real Property
Master Plan. The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Implementation of the 2005
Base Realignment and Closure Recommendations and Related Army Actions at Fort Belvoir
addressed the adoption of the amended land use plan as well as BRAC realignment plans (US
Army Corps of Engineers, 2007). The Army is currently in the process of preparing an update of
the Real Property Master Plan to address future growth on the garrison through 2030. The
HQINSCOM site is designated as professional/institutional under both the 2007 land use plan,
which is currently in effect, as well as the land use plan being proposed as part of the update of
the Real Property Master Plan.

Impacts of No Action: The No Action Alternative would have no impact on land use plans.

Impacts of the Proposed Action / Mitigation: The Proposed Action would be consistent with
both the approved land use plan and the plan proposed as part of the update of the Real Property
Master Plan: both designate the HQINSCOM site for professional/institutional uses. The
proposed intensification of the development on the site, keeping within already-developed areas
to the greatest extent possible, and reuse of surface parking lots for a parking structure are in line
with development parcel planning strategies proposed in the update of the Real Property Master
Plan.

The Proposed Action would require a small (0.34 acre) incursion into the FWC (an overlay area
designated as "natural constraints to development" under the existing and proposed plans), which
would represent an irretrievable commitment of natural resources. INSCOM would convert part
of the developed area back into a natural area as mitigation. INSCOM would remove pavement
from a 0.34-acre section of the current surface parking lot, grade it, seed it, and plant native trees
to replace the portion of the FWC affected. The Proposed Action is otherwise unlikely to affect
any land that would be designated for a different use, and would not likely preclude any options
under the continuing master planning process. No other mitigation is necessary.

efficiency, working environment, and physical security.              Maryland and Northern Virginia. 
Policies applicable to the proposed action include:

       Using innovative energy conserving techniques such as High Performance and
       Sustainable Building, Low Impact Building, Leadership in Energy and Environmental
       Design (LEED) strategies and requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
       Planning employee support through child-care among other considerations.
       Designing security barriers and checkpoints at vehicular entry points on federal
       installations to accommodate vehicular queuing on site, and to avoid adverse effects on
       adjacent public roadways operations and safety (NCPC, August 2004).

A second element of the NCPC Comprehensive Plan, Transportation, lists federal parking
policies and associated parking ratios to address the area's traffic congestion and poor air quality.
For suburban federal facilities located more than 2,000 feet away from a Metrorail Station (about
a ten-minute walk), which is the situation for all of Fort Belvoir, the parking ratio should reflect
a phased approach linked to planned improvements over time. Federal facilities served by high
occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes are expected to achieve a parking ratio of one space per two
employees. Federal facilities not served by HOV lanes, which is the situation at Fort Belvoir, are
expected to achieve a parking ratio of one space for every 1.5 employees (0.67 spaces per



                                                 3-7                        Environmental Assessment

person). The U.S. Army has its own, stricter standard of 0.6 spaces per person which is
equivalent to one space for every 1.67 employees.

NCPC guidance mandates that federal agencies develop a transportation management program
(TMP) when preparing a master plan or requesting site plan approval and anticipating an
increase in personnel. The goal of preparing a TMP is to foster more efficient employee
commuting patterns by minimizing "single occupant vehicle" (SOV) trips related to federal
agency worksites. This is mandated by federal air quality regulation, local trip reduction
ordnances, and NCPC planning requirements. Fort Belvoir is in the process of preparing an
installation-wide TMP to support the update of the Real Property Master Plan. INSCOM has
prepared a TMP specifically for this Proposed Action, as described in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.

Impacts of No Action: The No Action Alternative would have no impact on current plans or the
ongoing planning process.

Impacts of the Proposed Action / Mitigation: The expanded and renovated INSCOM facility
would achieve LEED-NC silver criteria. INSCOM does not propose to have a child care facility
on the site. However, the Army recently completed construction of two child development
centers on the South Post, is in the process of building two new centers on the FBNA, and plans
to build another on North Post in the next year to service incoming workers associated with
BRAC 2005 and other realignments. These centers will increase the capacity to provide child
care on Fort Belvoir by 874 children.

The access control point would not be modified. Vehicle queuing at HQINSCOM's entrance is
not presently an issue because Beulah Street "dead-ends" south of the site. Reconfiguration of the
surface parking lots and the new parking garage would provide 2,006 parking spaces on the
INSCOM site: 4461 spaces reserved for visitors and students, 36 spaces reserved for government-
stored vehicles, and the remaining 1,524 for INSCOM employees. The ratio of employee parking
spaces to employees would be approximately 1 space per 1.67 employees (0.60 spaces per
employee) which is lower than but consistent with the NCPC recommendations for federal
facilities not served by a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane, and also meets the Army's
standard of 0.60 spaces per employee (INSCOM, 2012).

NCPC will be given the opportunity to review this EA, assess the proposed action's
compatibility with federal planning goals, guidelines, and initiatives, and provide comments
before the decision is made to proceed with the action.

The expansion has been designed to fit as much within the area that has already been disturbed to
the extent practicable. No additional mitigation is proposed.

  This number includes 141 informal parking spaces along Beulah Street. Parking along Beulah Street is discussed
further in Section 3.2.1.

3.1.3    Coastal Zone Management  

Existing Conditions: The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 (16 USC § 1451, et
seq., as amended) provides assistance to the states, in cooperation with federal and local
agencies, for developing land and water use programs in coastal zones. Section 307(c)(1) of the
Coastal Zone Management Act Reauthorization Amendment (CZMARA) stipulates that federal
projects that affect land uses, water uses, or coastal resources of a state's coastal zone must be
consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of that state's
federally-approved coastal management plan. The Commonwealth of Virginia has developed and
implemented a federally-approved Coastal Resources Management Program (CRMP) describing
current coastal legislation and enforceable policies. There are enforceable policies for:

        Fisheries Management:
        Subaqueous Lands Management
        Wetlands Management
        Dune Management
        Non-point Source Pollution Control
        Point Source Pollution Control
        Shoreline Sanitation
        Air Pollution Control
        Coastal Lands Management.

Virginia's coastal zone includes all of Fairfax County, including Fort Belvoir; therefore, federal
actions at Fort Belvoir are subject to federal consistency requirements. The Virginia Department
of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) serves as the lead agency for consistency reviews.

Impacts of No Action: The No Action Alternative would have no impact on the Virginia coastal
zone or future implementation of the Coastal Resources Management Plan.

Impacts of the Proposed Action / Mitigation: Fort Belvoir has determined that the proposed
action is consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the Commonwealth of Virginia
CRMP's enforceable policies, as described in Appendix E, Coastal Consistency Determination.



3.2 Traffic and Transportation Networks 
3.2.1    Transportation Network 

Existing Conditions: Four principal roadways define the Northern Virginia highway system in
the vicinity of the site (Figure 7, Transportation Network in the Vicinity of HQINSCOM):
Interstate (I)-95, Fairfax County Parkway (Virginia Route [VR] 7100), Richmond (Jefferson
Davis) Highway (US 1), and Telegraph Road (VR 611). I-95 is the major north-south travel
route for traffic traveling along the East Coast through Northern Virginia. US 1 is a major four-
lane north-south transportation arterial that parallels I-95 in Northern Virginia and serves



                                               3-9                      Environmental Assessment
EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


regionally as an alternate corridor to I-95, connecting the City of Alexandria with points south,
including Fort Belvoir, Lorton Road, and the Fairfax County Parkway. Route 1 passes through
Fort Belvoir, while I-95 is located over two miles west of the project area.

Direct access to Fort Belvoir from I-95 is primarily via the Fairfax County Parkway (Route 7100
via Exit 166) with alternate access points at Lorton Road (Exit 163) and US 1 (Exit 161). The
Fairfax County Parkway is a divided four-lane limited access highway that links Fort Belvoir
with not only I-95, but the northern and western parts of Fairfax County. It connects with Route
1 approximately 0.8 miles southwest of the INSCOM site. For North Post destinations,
Telegraph Road is another public roadway that provides direct access to the northern boundary
of North Post and intersects with Fairfax County Parkway.

As shown on Figure 7, two gates control access to North Post: the Kingman Gate, which controls
access from the Fairfax County Parkway and the Telegraph Gate, which controls access from
Telegraph Road and Beulah Street. Based on a commuter survey of INSCOM personnel, 65
percent of INSCOM commuters use Kingman Gate and 23 percent use Telegraph Gate to access
the site in the morning (the remainder used South Post gates or lived on Fort Belvoir). Kingman
Gate is the closest gate to INSCOM, located only 0.3 miles away (the intersection of Kingman
Road and Fairfax County Parkway is approximately 0.75 miles away). The Telegraph Gate is
approximately 1.3 miles away. All visitors to the installation, including to INSCOM, must use
Tulley Gate, accessible from Route 1 and located approximately 3.1 miles away from the site
(INSCOM, 2012).

Within North Post, the INSCOM site is primarily served by three installation roadways:

       Beulah Street is a north-south road that provides access to North Post from Telegraph
       Road (through Telegraph Gate). The INSCOM site is located directly off of Beulah
       Street, south of Kingman Road. At this location, Beulah Street is two lanes and dead-ends
       after the access to INSCOM and a seldom-used back gate to the DLA facility (Atkins,
       2012).
       John J. Kingman Road (Kingman Road) is an east-west roadway that provides direct
       access to North Post from the Fairfax County Parkway (via Kingman Gate). As the
       primary access to North Post, it sees heavy traffic during peak periods. It is a four-lane
       divided roadway for most of its extent, but becomes a two-lane undivided road east of
       Gunston Road.
       Gunston Road is the Installation's major north-south roadway that provides the only
       connection between North and South Posts via a grade-separated crossing over Route 1.
       Gunston Road does not directly access the INSCOM site, but is the main roadway that
       serves North Post in general.

                                                     EA for HQINSCOM Expansion at Fort Belvoir


Currently, there are 951 parking spaces within the INSCOM compound to accommodate
personnel and visitors. The number of visitors to the site fluctuates and can be considerable.
Current parking demand outstrips the supply of parking spaces, which can result in up to
approximately 141 additional vehicles parking along the shoulders of Beulah Street, creating a
traffic safety problem. On some days parking demand exceeds even what can be accommodated
along the shoulders of Beulah Street, and employees and visitors must park wherever they can
find space, spilling over onto lawns and other green space. The ratio of parking spaces to
employees is discussed in Section 3.1.2.2.

Commuter transit services to the part of the Post where INSCOM is located are not immediately
adjacent and are inconvenient. Fairfax Connector Route 171 buses (all-day service) connect
INSCOM commuters with the Virginia Railway Express (VRE) Lorton Station, three mi
southwest of the INSCOM site. Fairfax Connector Routes 333/334 (all-day service) and 335
(express, peak hour; the "Belvoir Eagle") buses connect commuters directly to the
Franconia/Springfield Metrorail Station/VRE Station, approximately three mi north of the
INSCOM site. However, the buses do not directly serve the INSCOM site, and the nearest bus
stop, for Route 335 and an internal Belvoir peak hour shuttle, is located at the intersection of
John J. Kingman Road/Beulah Street, about 1,700 ft from the entrance to the Nolan Building or
about a five-minute walk. Bus stops for Routes 33/334 and 171 are located on the DLA site,
which requires a greater-than-five-minute walk to access the stops indirectly through a DLA gate
(INSCOM, 2012).

As part of an installation-wide Transportation Management Program (TMP) process, Fort
Belvoir initiated a commuter survey in October 2011 to gather information on current travel
activities between home and work for all personnel, and to understand employee demographics
and attitudes toward commuting choices. The survey included all INSCOM personnel, both at
Fort Belvoir and Metro Park. Of the 274 INSCOM respondents, 0.5 percent used bus services;
4.0 percent used the Virginia Railway Express (VRE); 5.0 percent used vanpools/carpools; 2.0
percent rode motorcycles; 1.0 percent either walked or rode bicycles; and 87.0 percent drove
alone to work (INSCOM, 2012).

Impacts of No Action: The No Action Alternative assumes that while INSCOM would not
expand, other short-range projects proposed for Fort Belvoir's North Post and the Davison Army
Airfield would be implemented by 2018 (IMCOM, 2012). These other projects include
improvements to Fort Belvoir's streets and roads, as well as improvements to the Fairfax County
Parkway, John J. Kingman Road, and Farrar Drive intersection and to the Kingman Gate to
facilitate traffic flow. Other major transportation improvements on Fort Belvoir include the
planned widening of US Route 1 from four to six lanes and the completion of Mulligan Road,
which will connect US Route 1 with Telegraph Road through Fort Belvoir. Additional lanes are
being added to the Telegraph Road and Beulah Street intersection by the new shopping center
being built in the northwest quadrant of the intersection. Together these projects will improve
traffic flows on, through, and near Fort Belvoir.

Improving commuting choices to and within Fort Belvoir and decreasing single-occupant (SOV)
use is the objective of an installation-wide TMP that is currently in preparation as well as an
INSCOM-specific TMP (INSCOM, 2012). The goal of the INSCOM TMP is to achieve a

                             1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel – Proposed Commercial Development


I. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Project Overview

A new mixed-use development, known for this study as the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel,
located along E. Franklin Street near its intersection with Elliott Road is being proposed in
Chapel Hill. The project proposes to construct a 106 room hotel and 28 apartments on two
existing parcels on the west side of E. Franklin Street. Figure 1 (found in Appendix A) shows
the general location of the site. The project is anticipated to be fully complete by late 2016.
This report analyzes the complete build-out scenario for the year 2017 (one year after
anticipated completion), the no-build scenario for 2017, as well as 2014 existing year traffic
conditions.

The proposed site concept plan shows two full movement access driveways along E. Franklin
Street. No other vehicular access connections are proposed. Figure 2 displays the preliminary
concept plan of the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel and nearby land uses and roadways. The
project is expected to provide 123 parking spaces on a surface parking lot.

B. Site Location and Study Area

This report analyzes and presents the transportation impacts that the 1609 E. Franklin Street
Hotel will have on the following intersections in the project study area:

      East Franklin Street and Eastgate Shopping Center Access Driveway
      East Franklin Street and Elliott Road
      East Franklin Street and Proposed Site Driveways
      East Franklin Street and Estes Drive

The impacts of the proposed site at the study area intersections will be evaluated during the
AM, noon, and PM peak hours of an average weekday. The following study is based on
background traffic for the existing year, 2014, the year following the estimated site build out year
of 2016, as well as the estimated site-generated traffic produced by the hotel development.

There are no Town-approved future developments in the immediate project study area that were
considered to be constructed by 2017, though there are multiple locations located beyond the
study area that may generate additional background traffic. To account for this, an area-wide
ambient future traffic growth percentage of 1.4 percent per year was applied to the existing
volumes, based on historical average annual daily traffic (AADT) growth rate data provided by
the Town of Chapel Hill and NCDOT, and consistent with recent study area traffic impact
studies.

C. Site Description                                         1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel Site
                                                                     (looking north)
The 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel site currently
contains two wooded land parcels with several
small residential structures. It borders a private
residence and the Chapel Hill Fire Station #3 to
the north and by the Artgarden Montessori
Children’s House to the south. It is located
immediately adjacent to the Chapel Hill Health
and Rehabilitation Center across E. Franklin
Street.   Additional    residential  subdivisions,
commercial and institutional development are
present along E. Franklin Street in the project
study area.                                                                 Image from Google Earth, 2014


All vehicular access will utilize E. Franklin Street via two proposed full access site driveways.
The proposed site plan, shown in Figure 2, indicates all parking will be accommodated on-site,
through the use of surface parking facilities. No other specific transportation improvements are
shown on the concept plans.

D. Existing and Proposed Uses in Vicinity of Site

The land uses and development in the study area along E. Franklin Street are primarily
commercial, with institutional and residential development nearby. The Existing Land Use Plan
shown in the 2020 Town of Chapel Hill Comprehensive Plan and adopted June 25, 2012,
indicates that the proposed site is designated as “institutional”. The Future Land Use Plan, that
is also a part of the Town Comprehensive Plan, indicates that the parcel would be designated
as “High Density Residential, 8-15 units/acre”. The parcel is currently zoned “NC” – delineating
it as “neighborhood commercial”.

E. Existing and Committed Surface Transportation Network

Roadways
The 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel project study area features several major arterial roadways
serving areas throughout the Town of Chapel Hill and points beyond, as well as some smaller
collector and local access streets. Table 1, on the following page, summarizes pertinent
information on the study area roadway facilities.

AADT data was taken from 2011 AADT mapping produced by the NCDOT Traffic Survey Unit.
Figure 3 shows the existing lane configuration, traffic control, and speed limits for these study
area roadways.

Detailed descriptions of several of the major study area roadways are as follows:

   E. Franklin Street is a major arterial in the study area, serving areas from the US 15-501
    corridor to downtown Chapel Hill. In the study area vicinity, E. Franklin Street is a five lane
    undivided cross-section with continuous center left-turn lane. There are multiple driveway
    access points along the roadway and several major street intersections. No on-street
    parking is permitted along E. Franklin Street in the project study area. Several bus stops
    are located along the facility. The posted speed limit is 35 mph in the study area.

   Estes Drive is a minor east-west arterial that connects residential and commercial areas of
    north/central Chapel Hill. In the study area, Estes Drive is an undivided facility with a five-
    lane cross section east of E. Franklin Street that features a continuous center left-turn lane
    with a 35 mph speed limit. It transitions to a two-lane undivided facility west of E. Franklin
    Street. Several bus stops are located along the facility.

   Elliot Road is a local/collector street that provides access to residential neighborhoods west
    of E. Franklin Street and commercial shopping centers and development to the east. The
    section west of E. Franklin Street is a two-lane facility and widens to a three-lane cross-
    section with continuous left-turn lanes east of E. Franklin Street. The posted speed limit is
    25 mph in the study area. On-street parking is not permitted.

   Eastgate Shopping Center Driveway is a local access street that provides access to the
    Eastgate shopping center and connectivity to Ephesus Church Road east of the study area.
    It is a two-lane facility with a posted speed limit of 25 mph in the study area. On-street
    parking is not permitted.

Sig – Signalized, Unsig – Unsignalized    Ped Signals (Number of Approaches Featuring Signals)

The project study area along E. Franklin Street features a mixture of signalized intersections at
major intersections and unsignalized intersections at minor local access street and private
driveway connections. The corridor features coordinated signal operation for weekday peak
hours, with current information from the Town of Chapel delineating the signals into two control
zones.

Bicycle Routes and Sidewalks
Specific bicycle facilities are not present in the immediate study area. Pedestrian sidewalk
exists along both sides of E. Franklin Street through the study area. Additional connectivity
exists along the Estes Drive and Elliott Road corridors. Sidewalk is also present on one side of
Eastgate Shopping Center Driveway. Crosswalks and pedestrian signals are present in several
quadrants at the three signalized study area intersections. Mid-block unsignalized crosswalks
are also present across E. Franklin Street (near the proposed site) and at the Eastgate
Shopping Center in the study area. The Lower Booker Creek Trail greenway currently connects
to E. Franklin Street in the project study area. Figure 4 displays a schematic of existing
pedestrian facilities in the project study area.

Transit Routes
Current Chapel Hill Transit (CHT) Routes CL, D, F, and DX serve the project study area along
E. Franklin Street, Estes Drive and Elliott Road with weekday bus service. Several bus stops,
with a range of amenities (shelters, benches), are present in the study area. Table 3 details the
four current CHT routes serving the study area. Most buses run on 15, 30, or hour headways
during weekday peak service periods.

Triangle Transit provides regional bus service to the immediate study area via the 400 and 405
Routes that run along E. Franklin Street and US 15-501 between Chapel Hill and Durham.
Service for these routes occurs at 30 minute headways during peak weekday periods.

Figure 5 displays transit routes and bus stops that currently exist in the project study area.
Transit trips generated by the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel site are discussed in the following
sections of this report, as the proximity and frequency of transit service directly within the
existing/proposed site may account for a measurable portion of site trips.

F. Existing Traffic Conditions

Figure 6 shows the existing AM, noon, and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the study area
intersections. The turning movement counts used to determine these volumes were conducted
in April 2014 for two study area intersections during the weekday periods 7:00 - 9:00 AM, 11:30
AM – 1:30 PM, and 4:00 – 6:00 PM. For the intersection of E. Franklin Street and Estes Drive,
previous count data from April 2013 was taken from the Glen Lennox Redevelopment Traffic
Impact Study. All turning movement count output is found in Appendix B.

Traffic count information shows traffic flows on E. Franklin Street were heavy during the AM and
PM peak count periods, with southbound flows into downtown Chapel Hill heaviest in the AM
peak and northbound return flows heaviest in the PM peak. Traffic on Estes Drive was moderate
to heavy during the peak commuting periods. Traffic flows were light to moderate on the
remaining study area roadways that function as collector or local access streets.

Table 4 provides a detailed listing of each intersection count, peak hour, and count date.

II. 2017 BUILD-OUT YEAR+1 CONDITIONS

A. Future Ambient Area-Wide Traffic Growth Estimation

Based on information on average daily traffic collected by the Town of Chapel Hill and the
NCDOT, a yearly ambient traffic growth rate of 1.4 percent per year was used for the short-term
2017 design year capacity analyses. This rate is based on previous and anticipated growth
trends for this area from Town and NCDOT average daily traffic information from the period
1990-2012, and matches detailed long-range growth estimates made for the Glen Lennox
Redevelopment Traffic Impact Study, prepared by HNTB in October 2013.

B. Approved Background Development Traffic Estimation

Per information from Town of Chapel Hill staff and information from the Town’s Planning
Department Development Activity Map (current as of April 2014), no Town-approved
developments that are either currently under construction or are expected to be built out and
fully operational by the 2017 design analysis year exist within the specific project study area.
Multiple developments are planned or ongoing around the Town as of the time of this study, but
their effects are captured within the ambient area-wide growth estimates as described
previously.

Figure 7 shows the estimated 2017 Build-out Year+1 peak hour background traffic volume
projections.

C. Proposed Project Traffic

   i. Trip Generation

   Projected trips for the proposed development were generated based on the ITE Trip
   Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 9th Edition, 2013. Standard ITE
   generation information was used for this study. No adjustments to trip generation rates (due
   to internal trips, pass-by trips, transit trips, pedestrian/bicycle trips) were made, as raw ITE
   data was used to make a conservative estimate of vehicular trips. Trip generation
   methodologies for estimated trips generated by the proposed hotel use NCDOT
   recommended “average rates” as the generating statistic, along with number of hotel rooms

                                 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel – Proposed Commercial Development

     as the generating variable. The apartment component uses “equation-based” generation
     rates.

     Table 5 shows the number of vehicular trips generated by existing 1609 E. Franklin Street
     Hotel during the weekday AM, noon, and PM peak hours of adjacent streets, based on the
     generation methodologies and comparisons described above.               A peak hour truck
     percentage of two percent was estimated for all site-generated traffic.

     ii.) Adjustments to Trip Generation Rates

     Raw ITE trip generation estimates for daily and peak hour trips have the potential to be
     adjusted for the following factors to reduce raw trip generation estimates to actual estimated
     vehicular trips produced by the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel development.

     a.) Internal Capture
     The land uses proposed for 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel development would not exhibit the
     potential for internally-captured trips for any on-site uses. No additional modifications or
     reductions were made to trip generation results to account for internal capture.

     b.) Modal Split
     The study area is well served by several CHT and Triangle Transit fixed bus routes with
     frequent existing service and also has facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists with good
     connectivity to trip attractions in downtown Chapel Hill, the UNC Main Campus and the US
     15-501 commercial corridor between Chapel Hill and Durham. Though it is highly likely that
     a portion of all site trips will utilize a mode other than single-occupant vehicles, to be
     conservative no quantitative estimate was made to reduce trip generation data for transit,
     walk trips or bicycle trips.

     c.) Pass-by Trips
     No pass-by trips were accounted for in this study, since the proposed 1609 E. Franklin
     Street Hotel is not a typical pass-by trip generator.

     d.) Trip Generation Budget
     Current information from the Applicant about the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel indicates that
     the project will be built out in one phase. No adjustments or recommendations for a trip
     generation budget are made for this study if the development is ultimately built to 106 guest
     rooms and 28 apartments (the trip generating variable used here).

   iii.) Trip Distribution

   Trip distribution for site-related traffic was based existing daily and peak hour traffic patterns
   to determine the directional peak hour characteristics of traffic to and from the site from the
   major study area thoroughfares.

   No local trips to/from lower volume collector and residential streets were estimated, though
   the possibility exists a small portion of trip-making may occur to/from these local streets.
   Basic distribution estimates for the proposed hotel utilized existing peak hour turning
   movement counts and overall daily traffic volumes along the higher volume arterial and
   collector streets to estimate a basic distribution of trips that would be consistent for all three
   peak analysis hours. It was also assumed that site driveway trips would enter/exit at equal
   proportions. Figure 8 presents the projected trip distribution traffic percentages for the
   proposed site in 2017.

   iv.) Trip Assignment

   Figure 9 shows the corresponding site traffic volumes distributed on the 2017 study area
   network. Total volumes into and out of the site correspond to total external vehicular trips
   generated, based on the trip generation methodology developed previously. It was
   assumed that the proposed site access points along E. Franklin Street would be allowed full
   access for future traffic assignment.

D. Future Traffic Forecasts with the Proposed Development

Figure 10 displays the 2017 Build-out+1 year projected study area traffic volumes with site
traffic added. These traffic volumes represent the aggregate traffic growth over existing traffic
volumes for ambient traffic growth and estimated site traffic assignments for the 1609 E.
Franklin Street Hotel.


III. IMPACT ANALYSES

A. Peak Hour Intersection Level of Service Analysis

   i.) Methodology

   Evaluation of traffic operations on suburban arterials is most effective through the
   determination of level of service (LOS) criteria. The concept of level of service correlates
   qualitative aspects of traffic flow to quantitative terms. This enables transportation
   professionals to take the qualitative issues, such as congestion and substandard
   geometrics, and translate them into measurable quantities, such as operating speeds and
   vehicular delays. The 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) characterizes level of
   service by letter designations A through F. Level of service A represents ideal low-volume
   traffic operations, and level of service F represents over-saturated high-volume traffic
   operations. Level of service is measured differently for various roadway facilities, but in
   general, level of service letter designations are described by the following in Table 6.

   The Synchro Professional Version 7 operations analysis software was used to analyze peak
   hour conditions at signalized intersections. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS+ Version
   6.0) was used to analyze peak hour conditions at unsignalized intersections. The minimum
   acceptable peak hour intersection level of service established for this project is LOS D for
   signalized intersections or LOS E for critical movements at unsignalized intersections, or no
   increase in delay for signalized intersections operating below LOS D or unsignalized
   intersection critical movements operating below LOS E without the inclusion of site traffic.
   The following four conditions were evaluated:

   Condition 1 - Existing Traffic
   Condition 2 - 2017 Traffic without Site Traffic
   Condition 3 - 2017 Traffic with Site Traffic Volumes Added
   Condition 4 - 2017 Traffic with Site Traffic and Improvements

                             1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel – Proposed Commercial Development


   The results of this analysis are based on the procedures presented in the HCM 2010 and
   performed with the corresponding capacity analysis software described previously. The
   methodology of evaluating each condition for signalized intersections is presented below:

      Condition 1 – Use current Town of Chapel Hill data for the cycle length, splits and
       offsets of individual signalized intersections and report LOS and delay values from
       Synchro.

      Conditions 2 and 3 – Reoptimize the cycle lengths and splits of individual intersections
       in Synchro, if existing timing data does not provide adequate overall intersection LOS.
       Adjust cycle lengths, splits, and offsets, if necessary, if the signal is currently operating in
       a coordinated system. The optimized signal timing information will be held constant for
       both Conditions, to provide a means to compare effects of the proposed site traffic.

      Condition 4 – Optimize coordinated traffic signals for effects of recommended
       mitigation strategies that change existing/committed changes to lane geometrics.
       Evaluate the potential for different signal phasing schemes (left-turn lag phases, for
       example).     Retain existing split minimums and any pedestrian timing values.
       Recommendations, if warranted, will be made to obtain at least LOS D for the
       intersection as a whole.

   The net effect of this process is that direct comparisons, by movement, of delay and LOS
   between each of the three conditions are impossible because splits and cycle lengths can
   and do change between conditions. The pertinent statistic of this analysis is the overall
   intersection level of service and delay. Improvements to deficient intersections in Condition
   3 were made by first attempting to adjust signal operations via changes in cycle lengths,
   splits and/or with acceptable adjustments to signal phasing. If that did not produce
   satisfactory results for all intersections, geometric improvements to improve intersection
   capacity were considered for the deficient intersections. Appendix C contains the Synchro
   output for all four conditions (where applicable).

   The proposed site driveway unsignalized intersections were analyzed directly in HCS. Their
   results were evaluated on a per-movement basis, since HCS does not produce an overall
   intersection level of service for unsignalized intersections. Thus, intersections with deficient
   (LOS F) movements in Condition 2 would need to be evaluated for improvements in
   Condition 3. This methodology differs from signalized intersections, where one or more
   movements at an intersection may be deficient in Condition 2, but as long as the overall
   intersection level of service does not fall below LOS D, no intersection improvements are
   deemed necessary. Appendix D contains the HCS output for all unsignalized intersections
   under study.

   ii.) 2014 Existing Conditions Results

   Table 7 presents the results for the existing year traffic conditions as compiled from field
   data. The table lists LOS and delay values for those movements that are in existence at this
   time. It also only lists data for individual movements encountering delay at the stop-
   controlled intersections (which do not have an overall intersection delay value produced by
   HCS).

     Currently, all study area signalized intersections operate at acceptable levels of service for
     all of the analyzed 2014 peak hours, with the exception of E. Franklin Street and Estes
     Drive. Based on existing peak hour traffic volumes, this intersection is over capacity in the
     noon and PM peak hours and nearly so in the AM peak hour. The combination of eight-
     phase traffic signal operations, with “protected only” left-turn signal operation at all
     approaches, and high volume turning movements cause excessive delay for multiple
     movements, with significant traffic queues.

     During Condition 2 - 2017 Without Site Traffic, all study area intersections are expected to
     still operate at acceptable levels of service for all analyzed peak hours, again with the
     exception of the high volume E. Franklin Street/Estes Drive intersection. For the Condition 2
     analysis, existing 2014 signal timings and system operations were held constant to examine
     the effects of potential background traffic growth. There are no committed NCDOT, Town, or
     private development background improvement projects in the project study area that are
     expected to be complete by 2017.

   held constant from 2017 Condition 2 – No-Build inputs. Unsignalized capacity analyses at
   the two proposed site driveways indicates that acceptable operations at each driveway will
   occur in all three peak hours in the 2017 Build scenario. The intersection of E. Franklin
   Street and Estes Drive is still expected to operate over capacity in the noon and PM peak
   hours and will be analyzed for mitigation options in Section III.A.v. below.

   v.) 2017 Mitigation Scenario (Condition 4) Results

   Table 10, on the following page, presents results for 2017 Build-out+1 year estimated traffic
   conditions, including impacts of site-related traffic and mitigation necessary to meet Town of
   Chapel Hill Guidelines and proposed recommendations from this study.

   The E. Franklin Street and Estes Drive intersection was investigated for operational
   improvements to mitigate existing deficiencies and provide improvements that would allow it
   to at least operate at 2017 predicted levels without the inclusion of site traffic. Current signal
   timings and operations along the E. Franklin Street corridor were reoptimized and
   coordination between the three project study signalized intersections was implemented.
   Results indicate that these adjustments may marginally improve operations at E. Franklin
   Street/Estes Drive to levels that are slightly better than 2017 Condition 2 – No-Build
   scenarios. No further geometric improvements to this intersection were tested, though it is
   likely that to completely resolve existing operational deficiencies would include the need to
   add capacity at one or several approaches.

   In addition to improvements at E. Franklin Street and Estes Drive, an additional
   improvement tested in Condition 4 was to combine the two proposed site driveway into a
   single access point with separate exiting left-turn and right-turn lanes. This improvement,
   studied for safety reasons and not strictly operational issues would still allow adequate
   operations for site traffic entering and exiting the site in 2017. Additional recommended
   details for intersection improvements are contained in Section IV.D.

B. Access Analysis

Vehicular site access is to be accommodated by two full movement access driveways
connecting to E. Franklin Street about 450 feet to the south/west of its signalized intersection
with the Elliott Road. Design details related to driveway throat lengths are shown on the
concept plan and assume an approximate 25 foot driveway throat at each driveway. A two-way
internal driveway circulation system to all surface parking areas is also shown on the plans.

Driveway distances along E. Franklin Street from the signalized intersections at Estes Drive and
Elliott Road are approximately 2,000 feet and 450 feet, respectively, and are acceptable, based
on recommendations of 100 foot minimum corner clearance as set forth in the 2003 NCDOT
Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways and the 250 foot minimum
along arterial streets specified in the 2005 Town of Chapel Hill Design Manual

The proposed spacing between the proposed driveways (140 feet) and between the proposed
driveways and adjacent existing driveways (approximately 50-75 feet) is less than the
recommended 750 foot spacing along arterial roadways found in Table 4-A-1 in the Town
Design Manual.

Access for pedestrians and bicyclists is adequate in the project study area. Sidewalk is present
on both sides of E. Franklin Street adjacent to the site and exists along the major street

connections along E. Franklin Street. Crosswalk and pedestrian signals exist across the three
major signalized study area intersections near the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel site. No specific
bicycle amenities are present along E. Franklin Street, but no restrictions to bicycle usage are
present either.

                                                       Town of Chapel Hill: Traffic Impact Study
                               1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel – Proposed Commercial Development

C. Signal Warrant Analysis

Based on projected 2017 traffic volumes and current/proposed access plans, no unsignalized
study area intersections would warrant the installation of a traffic signal, based on the
methodology found in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

D. Sight Distance Analysis

In general, sight distance issues entering/exiting the existing 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel
driveway would be minimal, considering the fact that E. Franklin Street has no horizontal
curvature in the vicinity of proposed access locations and vertical curvature at these locations is
minimal, giving exiting traffic adequate sight distance in both directions.

E. Crash Analysis

Data from the NCDOT Traffic Safety Unit was requested and was provided for the period
3/1/2009 to 2/28/2014 for the segment of E. Franklin Street from Estes Drive to the Eastgate
Shopping Center access driveway. Additionally, information was provided for crashes at all
major study area intersections for this time period. Raw crash data is located in Appendix E.

   E. Franklin Street Corridor
   There were 160 crashes reported along the E. Franklin Street study area corridor between
   Estes Drive and Eastgate Shopping Center over the five year period. In this 0.68 mile
   segment, crash types were primarily rear-end crashes, with several other crash types
   occurring. 88 of the 160 crashes were rear-end type crashes. The next highest crash types
   included 18 angle crashes, 22 left-turn crashes, and 13 sideswipe crashes.

   Table 11 presents a comparison between the E. Franklin Street study area crash rates and
   the latest North Carolina statewide rates for the period 2009-2011 (compiled by NCDOT
   Traffic Safety Unit). Overall, the number of crashes along E. Franklin Street in the project
   study area are much higher than statewide averages for similar facilities (four-lane undivided
   with continuous center turn lane) in every reported category. The crash severity for fatal
   crashes is lower than statewide averages, but higher for injury crashes.

   Study Area Intersections
   In addition to the crash comparison for the project study corridor, individual intersection
   crash data for the five year period was provided and results are shown in Table 12.

   Crash rate information taken from the crash reports indicates that the E. Franklin Street
   intersections with Estes Drive and Elliot Road have similar crash rates and represent a
   significant number of crashes when compared to overall corridor data.

Though no specific intersection crash data is available for the Chapel Hill Health and
Rehabilitation Center driveway that is located directly opposite the proposed hotel site, study
corridor crash data indicated that 4 crashes in 5 years occur in the vicinity of this opposing
driveway.

F. Other Transportation-Related Analyses

Other transportation-related analyses relevant to the 2001 Town of Chapel Hill Guidelines for
the preparation of Traffic Impact Studies were completed as appropriate. The topics listed in
Table 13 are germane to the scope of this study.

G. Special Analysis/Issues Related to Project

Based on discussions with Town of Chapel Hill staff, there are no special issues or analyses
beyond the ones already discussed for this proposed site.


IV. MITIGATION MEASURES/RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Planned Improvements

There are no Town of Chapel Hill or North Carolina Department of Transportation improvement
projects for study area roadway facilities within the analysis year time frame of 2014-2017.

B. Background Committed Improvements

There are no specific geometric or operational improvements to study area roadway
intersections or facilities related to background private development projects that are expected
to be completed between 2014 and 2017. To make an comparative assessment of changes in
traffic operations between the 2014 existing year, 2017 No-Build Scenario and 2017 Build
Scenario, it is not assumed that signal timing reoptimization would occur for the E. Franklin
Street corridor by the year 2017.

 Analysis               Comment
 Long-Range             Due to the fact that the proposed site will add less than 1,000 daily trips to the
 Planning Level Daily   study area network, no long-range daily v/c analysis was conducted for this
 Volume-Capacity        study.
 Analysis
 Turn Lane Storage      Storage bay lengths at study area intersections were analyzed using Synchro
 Requirements           and HCS 95th percentile (max) queue length estimates for the 2017 Build
                        Scenario. The E. Franklin Street/Estes Drive intersection eastbound approach
                        has existing and projected queues that exceed its current storage bays that
                        may need additional geometric improvement in the future.

                        Left-turn bays at Elliot Road and the Eastgate Shopping Center may not provide
                        adequate storage during peak hour conditions, based on existing storage
                        distances and projected queue lengths. However, options to extend these
                        storage distances are limited by the presence of nearby existing full access
                        driveways.

                        No other recommendations for improvements to storage bays are expected,
                        based on the analysis results.

 Appropriateness of     The site concept plan shows no specifics related to acceleration/deceleration
 Acceleration/          lanes. Based on existing cross-section details, corridor speeds on E. Franklin
 Deceleration Lanes     Street and capacity analysis results, no specific acceleration or deceleration
                        lanes are recommended at proposed site access points. No other specific
                        acceleration/deceleration lane issues were analyzed in the project study area.
 Pedestrian and         Existing pedestrian and bicycle access and connectivity is adequate along the
 Bicycle Analysis       E. Franklin Street corridor adjacent to the site. Sidewalk exists along major
                        connecting streets along the corridor and pedestrian crossings and signals are
                        present at signalized intersection. An additional mid-block crosswalk exists 750
                        feet to the south of the proposed site along E. Franklin Street. No delineated
                        bicycle lanes or wide outside lanes are present in the project study area. The
                        Lower Booker Creek Trail Greenway terminates along E. Franklin Street just
                        north of the Eastgate Shopping Center Driveway intersection, providing
                        additional bicycle and pedestrian connectivity to the area.

 Public                 Public transportation service to the study area, and to the proposed site, is
 Transportation         excellent with multiple bus stops and multiple local and regional bus routes on
 Analysis               E. Franklin Street proximate to the site.


C. Applicant Committed Improvements

Based on the preliminary site concept plans and supporting development information provided,
there are no specific external transportation-related improvements proposed adjacent to the
1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel.

                                                     Town of Chapel Hill: Traffic Impact Study
                             1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel – Proposed Commercial Development


D. Necessary Improvements

Based on traffic capacity analyses for the 2017 design year, and analyses of existing study area
turning bay storage lengths and site access, the following improvements are recommended as
being necessary for adequate transportation network operations (see Figure 11).

   1) Retime the E. Franklin Street and Estes Drive intersection to optimize overall capacity
      given the existing intersection geometrics and progression along E. Franklin Street.
      Also, retime the upstream signals at Elliot Drive and the Eastgate Shopping Center
      access driveway to promote coordinated traffic operations along E. Franklin Street.
      Current information from the Town of Chapel Hill suggests that the Estes Drive corridor
      may not be coordinated with the E. Franklin Street intersections at Elliot Drive and the
      Eastgate Shopping Center. Bringing those two intersections into coordination with the
      Estes Drive corridor may marginally improve operations at the critical E. Franklin
      Street/Estes Drive intersection. If additional measures are required to improve traffic
      operations at this intersection, geometric improvements may likely be needed. Since the
      recommended signal timing improvements allow the intersection to operate slightly
      better than the 2017 No-Build operations analysis results, and thus meet Town
      requirements for mitigation, no additional geometric improvements were tested.

       The proposed signal timing improvements are recommended in order to mitigate impacts
       from the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel site and improve conditions to at least 2017 No-
       Build levels.

   2) Due to the fact that the proposed site access driveways do not meet Town design
      standards for adequate driveway separation, and the fact that their proposed locations
      do not align with the existing Chapel Hill Health and Rehabilitation Center driveway on
      the opposite side of E. Franklin Street, it is recommended that the Applicant consider
      revising the site plan for a single full movement access driveway that would be located
      immediately opposite the Chapel Hill Health and Rehabilitation driveway.             This
      improvement would reduce the number of vehicular conflict points in this vicinity and
      improve safety along the E. Franklin Street corridor, which has a history of high numbers
      of vehicle crashes due to a continuous center left-turn lane and multiple driveway access
      points.

       Capacity analysis results indicate that a single full movement access driveway, with
       separate left-turn and right-turn lanes, will still provide adequate traffic operations in the
       2017 analysis year and not cause undesirable on-site vehicular queues.

       This improvement is recommended specifically for the 1609 E. Franklin Street Hotel
       project.

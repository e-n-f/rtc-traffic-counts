5.0          Introduction--Socioeconomics
LNG Development Company, LLC (d/b/a Oregon LNG) and Oregon Pipeline Company, LLC
(collectively, Oregon LNG) propose to own, construct, and operate the liquefied natural gas (LNG)
Export Project (Export Project), which will convert Oregon LNG's pending import receiving terminal
(Import Terminal) and pipeline (Oregon Pipeline), collectively referred to as the Import Project, into a
bidirectional LNG terminal (Bidirectional Terminal) and pipeline (Bidirectional Pipeline)
(collectively, the Bidirectional Project). Oregon LNG underwent an extensive National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) prefiling review process for the Import Project in Docket Number
PF07-10-000. The Import Project is pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000.
The Export Project consists of liquefaction facilities and associated support facilities (collectively, the
Export Terminal) to be constructed at the Import Project terminal site in Warrenton, Oregon;
approximately 39 miles of new pipeline (New Pipeline Segment) beginning at milepost (MP) 47.5 of
the Oregon Pipeline and terminating at the Williams Northwest Pipeline Interconnect (WNPI) near
Woodland, Washington; and a new, electrically driven gas compressor station (New Compressor
Station) at approximately MP 81 of the New Pipeline Segment. A complete description of the Export
Project can be found in Resource Report 1. This report cross-references the Environmental Report
(Exhibit F/F-I), Oregon LNG Terminal and Oregon Pipeline Project, Warrenton, Oregon (Oregon
LNG, 2008) currently under FERC review.
The purpose of this resource report is to describe the existing socioeconomic conditions of the
affected areas in Oregon and Washington where Oregon LNG proposes to construct and operate the
Export Terminal and New Pipeline Segment. The report then provides an assessment of the potential
socioeconomic impacts resulting from the construction and operation of the Export Project and
methods to mitigate any potentially adverse impacts.
This report is presented in three main sections. Section 5.1 summarizes the baseline existing
socioeconomic conditions in the vicinity of the Export Project, including data by county where the
proposed facilities will be located. Section 5.2 addresses the socioeconomic impacts of construction
and operation of the Export Project, and, where possible, provides methods that Oregon LNG will use
to mitigate adverse impacts. Section 5.3 contains a list of sources used to prepare this report.
This draft resource report for the Export Project is submitted in accordance with FERC's NEPA
mandatory prefiling review requirements and is limited to the newly proposed Export Project, except
in instances where the context dictates discussion of the Bidirectional Project as a whole to enable
FERC analysis. For example, the results of an economic impact study of the Bidirectional Project
are provided in ECONorthwest's 2012 report (ECONorthwest, 2012) titled An Economic Impact
Analysis of the Oregon LNG Project in Northwest Oregon (see Appendix 5A) because it is
impractical to separately analyze the socioeconomic impacts of the Export Project in light of the
Bidirectional Project's design, which calls for integrated construction and operation of all facilities
(import and export). CH2M HILL conducted a detailed analysis of the transportation impacts
associated with the Export Project and provided the results in a 2012 report titled Traffic Impact
Study, Oregon LNG Export Project, Warrenton, Oregon (TIS) (see Appendix 5B).

5.1          Existing Conditions
5.1.1        Population, Employment, and Economy
The current population, employment, and economic conditions in the Export Project area provide a
baseline from which to assess construction and operation impacts. A summary of the pertinent
population and employment data for each county touched by the Export Project is provided in Table
5.1-1. The table shows that in 2010, the counties had an average population of 148,752. Washington
County has the largest total population (529,710) and population density (731.4 people per square
mile [mi2]), and Tillamook County has the smallest total population (25,250) and density (22.4 people
per mi2). These data, coupled with the civilian workforce numbers described below, provide an idea
of worker availability within the counties surrounding the Export Project.
Table 5.1-1 shows that Clatsop, Tillamook, Columbia, and Cowlitz counties have average per capita
incomes lower than the state averages of $26,171 for Oregon and $29,733 for Washington (U.S.
Census Bureau [USCB], 2010). The average per capita income, weighted for population, for the
counties associated with the Export Project is $28,568.
Oregon had a civilian workforce of 1,994,700 and Washington had a civilian workforce of 3,480,300
as of December 2011 (U.S. Department of Labor [USDOL], 2011). Table 5.1-1 shows that
Washington County has the largest civilian labor force of the counties associated with the Export
Project. Columbia and Cowlitz counties have a higher unemployment rate than the state averages of
8.9 percent in Oregon and 8.5 percent in Washington, as shown in the table (USDOL, 2012). Data on
workforce and unemployment provide a picture of the workers available for construction and
operation of the Export Project, as described in Section 5.2.1 below.
In 2010, the largest employment sectors for the state of Oregon were education, health, and social
services at 21.7 percent; manufacturing at 11.3 percent; and retail trade at 12.5 percent (USCB, 2010).
In 2010, the largest employment sectors for the state of Washington were education, health, and
social services at 21.0 percent; retail trade at 11.6 percent; and professional, scientific, management,
administration, and waste management at 11.8 percent (USCB, 2010). Table 5.1-1 provides major
industries for the Export Project vicinity by county and state.
Many large employers are located within the general vicinity of the Export Project. The following
description of the largest employers found in the counties crossed by the Export Project is provided to
give an idea of the skills within the existing labor force. Intel is one of Oregon's largest private
employers, with 15,500 workers in Washington County (Earnshaw, 2008). Nike Inc., one of Oregon's
two Fortune 500 companies along with Precision Castparts in Multnomah County, is located in
Beaverton and employs approximately 7,000 in Washington County. Other major private employers
in Washington County include Tektronix Inc. and Xerox Corporation Tektronix Inc. creates computer
software and employs about 2,100 individuals, while Xerox Corporation employs about 1,500 people.
Major employers in Cowlitz County include St. Johns Medical Center, with approximately 1,600
employees, and Weyerhaeuser Company, with approximately 1,500 employees.

5.1.2         Housing
Housing is required to accommodate the construction workers who arrive in the Export Project
vicinity. Available accommodations vary greatly by county within areas surrounding the Export
Project. Table 5.1-2 shows owner and renter housing data for each county crossed by the Export
Project.
The data in Table 5.1-2 show that Clatsop County has the highest rental vacancy rate (10.1 percent),
followed by Cowlitz County (7.2 percent), Washington County (6.9 percent), and Columbia County
(6.8 percent). Clatsop and Cowlitz counties also have the lowest median monthly rents.
Hotel and motel rooms are also available, primarily in the larger cities within the Export Project
vicinity. Private and public campgrounds offer a variety of housing services, from tent sites to
recreational vehicle facilities. Hotel, motel, and bed and breakfast (B&B) vacancy rates are not
generally available. However, the Finance Department for the City of Astoria, which is one of the
closest cities to the Export Terminal location, tracks the total number of rooms rented as part of the
city's hotel tax collection. Table 5.1-3 shows that the hotel/motel vacancy rate in Astoria varies
depending on the season.

RESOURCE REPORT 5--SOCIOECONOMICS

2010-2011 property tax analysis from the Oregon Department of Revenue and the 2011 property tax
analysis from the Washington Department of Revenue identified 224,162 total acres of private
farmland with a real market value averaging $8,568 per acre and 1,417,267 total acres of privately
held forestland worth $1,345 an acre.
Data from the separate county assessors' offices and the state Departments of Revenue, provided in
Table 5.1-6, show that in fiscal year 2010-2011, the real market value of all properties in the four
counties was approximately $91.459 billion. However, this amount includes many exempt, partially
exempt, and specially assessed properties, which are either not subject to any property taxes or
receive special treatment that effectively lessens their taxability. Therefore, taking such exemptions
and special treatment into account, the state Departments of Revenue report that about $1.030 billion
in property taxes were imposed.

values of adjacent properties. The 2008 study entitled Natural Gas Pipelines and Residential
Property Values: Evidence from Clackamas and Washington Counties (ECONorthwest, 2008a)
statistically estimates the impacts of a similar intrastate pipeline that went into service in September
2004. ECONorthwest's study results and conclusions are summarized in Subsection 5.2.3.
Property Tax Implications. Oregon LNG contracted ECONorthwest to conduct research on how
property taxes will change on those properties crossed by the Oregon Pipeline. The results and
conclusions are presented in Resource Report 5 filed under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-
7-000 (Oregon LNG, 2008) and are summarized in subsection 5.2.3 below.

5.1.4        Transportation
Transportation routes in the vicinity of the Export Project were identified and assessed to provide a
baseline for determining impacts from both the construction and operational phases. Oregon LNG
completed a TIS (CH2M HILL, 2012; see Appendix 5B) that provides details on the existing traffic
conditions and transportation routes. Table 5.1-7 lists by county the main highways and railroads
crossed by the Export Project. Figure 5.1-1 shows their locations.

The Export Terminal is proposed on the East Bank Skipanon Peninsula (ESP), located north of
Harbor Street (also known as the Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105) in the city of Warrenton, Clatsop
County, Oregon. Primary access to the area is provided by U.S. 101. The Youngs Bay Bridge
connects the city of Warrenton to the city of Astoria and U.S. 30 along U.S. 101 to the northeast. To
the south, U.S. 101 provides access to the communities of Seaside/Gearhart and the Portland area via
U.S. 26. Access from the west and additional access from the south is provided by Fort Stevens
Highway 104.
The TIS (CH2M HILL, 2012; see Appendix 5B) indicates that average daily trips (ADT) along
Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 range between 8,700 vehicles west of King Avenue and 2,350
vehicles south of Harbor Street on Marlin Avenue. The ADT on U.S. 101 ranges between 13,950
vehicles (west of Marlin Avenue) and 19,300 vehicles on the Youngs Bay Bridge from Astoria.

5.1.5        Public Services
Existing public services within the Export Project vicinity have been identified for use in case of an
emergency and to assess impacts on these services during construction and operation.

5.1.5.1 Emergency Services
Table 5.1-8 provides contact information for local public safety officials near the Export Project.

Law enforcement contact information is included in Table 5.1-8. The primary law enforcement
agencies within the counties crossed by the proposed Pipeline are county sheriff offices, which may
work in conjunction with local police jurisdictions. The primary law enforcement agencies within the
Export Terminal vicinity are the Warrenton and Astoria police departments.
The Warrenton Police Department, located west of the Export Terminal, currently has one chief of
police and 12 patrol officers (Warrenton Police Department, 2012). The department has roughly 15
patrol vehicles.
The Astoria Police Department currently has one chief of police, one deputy chief, three sergeants,
one detective, and nine patrol officers (Astoria Police Department, 2012). Information about the
number of patrol vehicles is not publicly available for homeland security reasons.
Table 5.1-9 identifies the closest hospital within each of the four counties crossed by the Pipeline and
one county that includes the Export Terminal. The table shows at least one hospital in each county.

    Distance from Export Terminal.


Columbia Memorial Hospital (CMH) serves the Astoria-Warrenton area, where the Export Terminal
will be located. It is a full-service, critical access, Level III trauma center with 25 beds. CMH recently
completed a 38,000-square-foot expansion, which allowed it to become a regional medical center
(CMH, 2012). LifeFlight provides emergency transportation via helicopter from locations
surrounding the Export Project site to Columbia Memorial Hospital or to locations such as Legacy
Emanuel Hospital in Portland.
The nearest hospital is the Columbia District Hospital, located in Columbia County 3.9 miles from
the proposed Pipeline. Among the hospitals identified in Table 5.1-9, Tillamook County has the
hospital farthest from the Export Project, with Tillamook County General Hospital located about 32.0
miles from the New Pipeline Segment.

Pacific Islander, Native American or Alaskan Native, or Hispanic. On average, minorities make up
11 percent of the population when looking at data for affected counties (USCB, 2010). This value is
lower than the overall composition of the minority population for the entire states of Oregon
(16.4 percent) and Washington (22.4 percent). A higher percentage of white individuals (88.9
percent) was identified as living in the affected counties than in the two states as a whole
(87.1 percent for Oregon, 81.4 percent for Washington). Also, a smaller percentage of Hispanic
residents live in the affected counties compared to either state. Table 5.1-12 summarizes the racial
and ethnic composition of the populations in the counties intersected by the Export Terminal and New
Pipeline Segment.

Oregon LNG also analyzed the minority population data at the census tract level. According to the
U.S. Census Bureau (2012), census tracts are "small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a
county" which are designed to include 2,500 to 8,000 people of a relatively homogenous group with
respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census block groups are
combinations of census blocks, which are the smallest geographic area identified by the Census and
which are delineated by streets, roads, railroads, streams, and other physical and cultural features. The
four affected counties include six census tracts. Figure 5.1-2 shows all the census tracts crossed by the
Export Project, including the tract in which the Export Terminal will be located. The population
composition of each census tract is provided in Table 5.1-13.
In general, the average percentages of tract population composition are comparable to those for both
states, with white and Hispanic having the largest percentages. However, several census tracts have
population compositions different from those for the states of Oregon and Washington. The only
census tract with a noticeably higher proportion of Hispanic residents is tract 001502 in Cowlitz
County.

The USCB measures low-income populations based on a threshold that takes into consideration
income and size of the family. A low-income area is defined as an area containing at least 20 percent
low-income residents (USCB, 2012). Table 5.1-14 summarizes the 2010 poverty status of counties
affected by the Export Project.

Table 5.1-14 shows that the average percentage of households below the poverty level in the Export
Project area is 8.4 percent. This value is slightly lower than the overall average percentage of
households below the poverty level in Oregon and Washington. This number is slightly skewed by
the high population in Washington County, in which only a small portion of the New Pipeline
Segment travels. Without Washington County's numbers included, the average percentage of
households below the poverty level is 11.2, which is comparable to statewide numbers.

According to USCB data (2010) for the Export Project area, one census tract has a higher percentage
of residents below the poverty line than the state averages of 15.8 percent for Oregon and 13.4
percent for Washington. This census tract is census tract 001502 in Cowlitz County (22.1 percent).
Only census tract 001502 is above the 20 percent threshold and therefore is examined further below.
The census tract data show that the Export Project does not disproportionately affect low-income
populations in the other areas.
Census Tract 001502. Census tract 001502 in Cowlitz County has a population with 22.1 percent of
residents below the poverty line as well as a relatively large population of Hispanic residents
(13.9 percent). Therefore, this census tract warranted further investigation to ensure the Export
Project would not impose disproportionately high human or environmental effects on minority or
low-income populations.
In total, the proposed Pipeline is routed through approximately 4 miles of census tract 001502. The
Pipeline primarily affects tax lots currently used for agricultural purposes. No structures will be
displaced in this census tract. Oregon LNG conducted further ethnicity and poverty analyses, with the
most detailed levels of information available.
Data for the nine affected census blocks were evaluated to further examine racial and ethnicity
characteristics in the area intersected by the proposed Pipeline. Table 5.1-16 shows that five out of the
six affected census blocks that provide ethnicity data have a population below 13.9 percent Hispanic
residents, which is lower than census tract 001502 as a whole. One census block, 3016, has a
population that is 54.2 percent Hispanic. The population of this block is very low (below 50 people),
and a few people can skew the population numbers. This census block should not be ignored, but
since the large majority of the census tract in question has a significantly lower population of
Hispanic residents than does the surrounding parts of the census tract, the Export Project can
reasonably be stated to not adversely impact a disproportionate number of Hispanic residents.

Because of data constraints, the percentage of residents below the poverty line was not able to be
examined at a more refined level than census tracts, which provide the most detailed information
available on poverty. Therefore, we are unable to determine the poverty status of individuals living
within Census Block Groups 1, 2, and 3 through which the Pipeline travels.
Table 5.1-16 shows that there will not be a disproportionate impact on Hispanic residents in census
tract 001502 because the census blocks that the project crosses through have Hispanic proportions
similar to Cowlitz County as a whole. The data for these areas are comparable to the data for Cowlitz
County, the average for the Export Project area, and the state of Washington. Poverty information is
not available at a more refined level than what is presented in Tables 5.1-15 and 5.1-17.
In April 1997, President Clinton issued EO 13045, "Protection of Children from Environmental
Health Risks and Safety Risks," which recognizes that "a growing body of scientific knowledge
demonstrates that children may suffer disproportionately from environmental health and safety risks."

Table 5.1-18 shows that Columbia and Washington counties have higher percentages of children
under age 18 than the Oregon state average of 25.4 percent, and Cowlitz County has a higher
percentage of children under age 18 than the Washington state average of 26.3 percent. However,
none of the counties has a percentage that is significantly higher than the state average. Washington
County has the largest percentage difference, which is only 2.5 percent higher than the state average.
Thus, the percentage of children under 18 was not analyzed further.

5.1.7        Marine Activities
The Export Terminal will rely on delivery from LNG carriers (LNGCs) arriving at the ESP from the
Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River. Therefore, Oregon LNG analyzed the existing economic
conditions on the Columbia River, specifically the lower Columbia River, to provide a baseline of
information from which to assess Export Project impacts. The lower Columbia River is defined as the
segment of the river stretching from the mouth upriver 103.5 miles to the end of the dredged deep-
water navigation channel at Portland/Vancouver. This analysis included a review of nearby ports and
marinas, commercial shipping, commercial and recreational fishing, and Native American fishing
treaty rights. The existing conditions are provided in the following subsections.

5.1.7.1 Ports and Marinas in the Export Project Area
The lower Columbia River includes the following ports: Astoria, Portland, and St. Helens in Oregon;
and Kalama, Longview, Vancouver, and Woodland in Washington. Portland and Vancouver are
responsible for handling the majority of cargo for the Export Project area.
Port of Astoria. The Port of Astoria (POA) is the first available deep-draft port along the Columbia
River and the nearest to the ESP. It is located 14 miles from the Pacific Ocean and 2.5 miles upstream
of the ESP. The Port currently maintains approximately 7,250 feet of total dock space on its three
piers. The three piers and surrounding area are dedicated to marine-dependent commercial and
industrial activities (POA, 2012a).

Pier 1 generally serves as the port-of-call for a variety of cruise ships. In 1996, cruise ships began
visiting the POA. Over the past several years, the number of cruise vessel calls has decreased. It is
currently estimated that up to two to three cruise ships per week use Pier 1. Pier 1 also accommodates
general cargo, military, research, and industrial vessels. The maximum vessel length allowed on Pier
1 is 1,100 feet (POA, 2012a).
Pier 2 also accommodates vessels up to 1,100 feet in length. Pier 2 serves the majority of commercial
fishing and gillnetting needs within the port, which is a year-round business. There are three fish
processors and a 71,800-square-foot multi-tenant building within this pier. Pier 2 is also the home of
an oil spill response vessel owned by the Marine Spill Response Corporation (POA, 2012a).
Pier 3 serves the POA's recreational and commercial boaters as a haul-out/boatyard facility. The
facility covers approximately 10 acres and provides in-water storage, upland storage, and long-term
boat storage and trailer parking (POA, 2012a). The boaters who use Pier 3 are already experienced in
dealing with the large vessels traveling up and down the Columbia River.
The nearest marina to the ESP is located within the Skipanon River immediately southwest of the
Export Terminal site. A number of commercial and recreational vessels are moored at this marina and
travel in and out of the Skipanon River.
City of Warrenton. The Export Terminal location is within the city of Warrenton, which does not
have an existing deep-water port on the Columbia River. However, the city does have a marina, the
Warrenton Marina, in the Skipanon River. The Warrenton Marina is used for commercial fishing and
recreational vessels. The marina includes 330 boat slips and 2 boat ramps located on the Skipanon
River upstream of the Export Terminal location on the ESP.
In 2010, Weyerhaeuser Company sold its lumber mill approximately ½ mile upstream of the Export
Terminal location to Hampton Affiliates, which reopened the facility in the summer of 2011.
Hampton Affiliates is a Northwest-owned company that specializes in forest products and manages
approximately 400,000 acres of forest in the Northwest. Hampton Affiliates delivers their materials
via truck and rail, and they do not use the Skipanon River for tug and barge traffic as Weyerhaeuser
did (Hampton Affiliates, 2012).

5.1.7.2 Vessel Traffic in the Export Project Area
Subsection 1.1.1.1 in Resource Report 1 provides data on ocean-going vessel traffic within the
Exclusive Economic Zone of the U.S., which extends 200 miles offshore. The following section
focuses on vessel traffic within the lower Columbia River. In 2010, ocean-going vessels on the
Columbia River transported $11.9 billion worth of products to and from world markets. The
commodities these ships carry include millions of tons of grains; mineral bulks such as potash and
soda ash; breakbulks such as steel and forest products; automobiles from Honda, Toyota, Hyundai,
and Subaru; and containerized freight such as clothing, electronics, animal feed, and paper products
(Portland Port Authority [PPA], 2012a).
The number of ships crossing the Columbia River Bar, which is defined as the entrance to the
Columbia River from the Pacific Ocean, has dropped since the 1990s. The bar is approximately
3 miles wide and 6 miles long, although the entrance to the channel is 2,640 feet wide, making it a
challenging body of water to navigate (Columbia River Bar Pilots, 2012a). The average number of
ships crossing the bar every month for the period from 1992 through 1999 was 342, and the average
number of vessels crossing the Columbia River Bar monthly between 2001 and 2011 was only 217
(Columbia River Bar Pilots, 2012b). The Port of Portland Web site indicates that ship visits to that
port have dropped from a high of 1,024 ship visits in 1994 to 554 visits in 2011, a 46 percent decline
(PPA, 2012b). The Port of Portland states that cargo tonnage increased from 7.3 million tons in 1981

to 13.4 million tons in 2011 (PPA, 2012b). Increases in cargo with decreases in ship traffic are
attributed to ship size. The average size of ships transiting the lower Columbia River has grown,
resulting in a decrease in overall ship traffic.
The POA receives calls from a number of ocean-going and river-based cruise ships. These ships will
pass the Export Terminal during arrival and departure. The majority of the larger vessels using the
POA are cruise ships because the port is a member of Cruise-the-West, a cruise consortium. Cruise-
the-West is called on by major cruise ships when repositioning between the Alaska routes in the
summer and the Caribbean and Mexican routes in the winter. The cruise ship schedule for 2012 is
included in Table 5.1-19.
Table 5.1-19 shows that 10 cruise ships are currently scheduled to call on the POA in 2012. These
ships range in passenger capacities from 490 to 2,934.
The smaller river cruise ships (200 to 250 passengers) operate upriver year-round, but mostly in the
spring through fall; only a small number travel as far downriver as the Export Terminal. Between
2000 and 2007, the number of combined cruise ship and river cruise calls at POA decreased.
However, the number of passengers increased; there were approximately 134 vessel calls and 20,000
passengers in 2000 and approximately 97 vessel calls and 27,500 passengers in 2007 (POA, 2008).

Tug and barge usage near the Export Terminal was estimated at two to three transits past the Terminal
site per day in 2008, occurring any time of the day or night (Halcrow, Inc., 2008). However, most of
these transits were related to the Weyerhaeuser Mill located up the Skipanon River from the Export
Terminal location on the ESP. That mill was recently purchased and reopened by Hampton Affiliates,
which does not use the river for tug and barge traffic; therefore, this number is likely lower.

5.1.7.3 Commercial and Recreational Fishing
The lower Columbia River supports diverse commercial and recreational fishing industries whose
harvests include sturgeon, salmon, steelhead, bottomfish, and crabs. The largest fisheries when
measuring by boat numbers are salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon. Commercial fishing and recreational
fishing in the terminal area are discussed in Resource Report 5 under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000
and CP09-7-000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).

The New Pipeline Segment also crosses rivers that accommodate recreational fishing. Oregon LNG
conducted an inventory of the rivers crossed by the Pipeline using the Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife's 2012 Oregon Sport Fishing Regulations (see Northwest Columbia River zones) (Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife [ODFW], 2012), information on known coldwater fisheries, and data
collected during field surveys to determine where crossings are proposed within potential recreational
fisheries and to develop a strategy for minimizing impacts to these areas.
In Oregon and Washington, it is possible for anglers to fish any river or stream (unless fishing is
specifically prohibited or is seasonal) when in possession of the required licensing and without
trespassing on private property. However, the vast majority of recreational fishers prefer fishing
where greater quantities of large fish are present. It is assumed that recreational fishing is more likely
to occur on larger perennial or ephemeral rivers and streams with widths of at least 10 feet measured
from the ordinary high water mark (OHWM). Thus, Oregon LNG used data collected during field
surveys, in addition to known information on recreational fisheries and existing coldwater fisheries, to
identify potential recreational fisheries crossed by the Export Project. Table 5.1-20 provides the
results of this inventory by showing the proposed crossings where recreational fishing has the greatest
potential to occur.

The potential for recreational fishing for resident cutthroat trout is possible and presumed likely at all
stream crossings. Recreational fishing for anadromous species is possible and presumed to occur at
any location where anadromous species occur. Fishing for introduced warmwater fish is only likely in
the Columbia River and in tributaries to the Columbia River near their mouths. Aside from those
indicated as "presumed," all other Pipeline crossings are sufficiently far upstream that warmwater
fishing is unlikely.
Table 5.1-20 shows that 20 river and stream crossings were identified as having the potential to
support more than nominal recreational fishing. The table also shows that three of these rivers and
streams, or 15 percent, will be crossed using the horizontal directional drilling (HDD) method of
construction (method 2). This includes the only proposed river crossing with a width measured from
the OHWM of 100 feet or greater (the Columbia River). The table shows that dry crossing
construction method (method 1) is proposed for 16 of the remaining 17 waterbodies listed, and open-
cut trenching is proposed for only one of the crossings. Section 5.2.7.3 in this report describes the
methods Oregon LNG will implement to minimize potential impacts to these recreational fisheries.

5.1.7.4 Native American Fishing Treaty Rights
Native American fishing treaty rights for the Export Project remain as documented in Resource
Report 5 under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).


5.2          Socioeconomic Construction and Operational Impacts
Both short- and long-term socioeconomic impacts will occur as a result of the construction and
operation of the Export Project facilities. During construction, there will be a minor increase in local
population as well as an increase in the demand for temporary housing. In addition, the Export Project
will result in a temporary increase in the use of available transportation systems in the surrounding
areas. Economic benefits from construction of the Export Project include an increase in local
employment, which in turn results in an increase in local spending.
Operation of the Export Terminal, New Pipeline Segment, and associated facilities will provide long-
term benefits to surrounding communities and the states of Oregon and Washington. Property taxes paid
on the Export Project will result in increased revenues available to local jurisdictions. The new increase
in available energy in the form of natural gas could attract additional industry to the area, resulting in
an increase in available jobs beyond those provided directly by the Export Project. Additional
industry and jobs result in increased manufacturing output.

5.2.1        Population, Employment, and Economy
Oregon LNG contracted ECONorthwest to prepare An Economic Impact Analysis of the Oregon LNG
Project in Northwest Oregon (2012; see Appendix 5A) using data on the Project design, construction
estimates, and existing conditions, as described in Subsection 5.1.1. ECONorthwest conducted this
analysis using IMPLAN, an economic impact modeling tool, for the entire Bidirectional Project (the
proposed Terminal and Pipeline, including that which has already been filed under Docket Numbers
CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000). Oregon LNG decided not to divide the analysis into the different
dockets in order to understand the larger economic context of the Bidirectional Project, as well as
avoid the difficulty of separating the costs and benefits. The analysis resulted in the following
conclusions:
     The construction of the Bidirectional Project, spanning a 4-year period, will spend over $6.39
     billion on labor, materials, equipment, and services. Construction will take place in northwest
     Oregon and southwest Washington and will provide 3,011 average annual jobs with wages and

     benefits over $492 million. Of these jobs, 2,608 will be filled by Oregon and Washington
     workers, with average yearly wages over $429 million.
     Such a large construction project will, through local purchases and hiring, stimulate an additional
     $5.76 billion in economic output during the period and support another 1,477 average annual jobs
     in Oregon and Washington. Oregon, overall, currently has an 8.8 percent seasonally adjusted
     unemployment rate (USDOL, 2012). However, its resident workforce, at nearly 2 million
     including about 63,300 construction workers, should provide many of the construction workers
     for the Bidirectional Project.
     Once operating, the Bidirectional Project will contribute $6.359 billion in economic output, 147
     direct jobs, and $14 million in personal income locally (i.e., within Clatsop County for the
     Bidirectional Terminal and Tillamook, Washington, Columbia, and Cowlitz counties for the
     Bidirectional Pipeline). These benefits will occur every year that the facilities operate.
     Across Oregon and southwest Washington, the benefits of operations will be greater than the
     benefits to the counties directly crossed by the Bidirectional Project. Annual economic output will
     be nearly $6.55 billion more than if the Bidirectional Project was not built and the region will be
     able to support 1,591 additional jobs.

5.2.1.1 Bidirectional Pipeline
An Economic Impact Analysis of the Oregon LNG Project in Northwest Oregon prepared by
ECONorthwest (2012; Appendix 5A) provides additional detail on the economic impacts of the
Bidirectional Project. It is anticipated that construction of the Bidirectional Pipeline will take
approximately 4 years to complete (from about 2014 to 2018). This timeframe has the potential to
increase, depending on major rain events and topography. The portion of the Pipeline called the New
Pipeline Segment will be constructed in two separate segments called spreads: the first runs
approximately 34 miles to the Columbia River and the second runs approximately 5 miles to the
Williams Northwest Pipeline Interconnect. These spreads will be constructed at or near the same time
but by separate contractors. Each spread will include its own staging area, where pipe and other
construction materials will be stored. Oregon LNG expects to hire construction contractors that use
mostly union labor. Therefore, it is anticipated that hiring will occur within areas surrounding the
Project. Pipeline construction is highly specialized and requires highly trained and skilled workers
such as certificated welders. There is potential for other similar construction projects during the same
period, and thus employers and unions may have to bring in some workers from outside the Project
area. Oregon LNG will work with the selected contractors to optimize local hires, especially when
they possess the necessary skills for pipeline construction. It is expected that the increase in jobs
available during construction of the Bidirectional Project will cause a temporary decrease in
unemployment rates for the region.
Minor increases in population levels will occur as workers with specialized skills move into the area.
These increases will be limited to the duration of construction. Indirect hires are not expected due to
the short duration that workers will spend in any particular area. Upon completion of construction,
approximately four permanent workers will be required for operation of the Pipeline facilities,
primarily the electrically driven gas compressor station.

5.2.1.2 Bidirectional Terminal
Construction of the Bidirectional Terminal will require an average of 2,755 construction workers
during the 48-month construction period, beginning in 2014. Construction worker estimates are based
on Bidirectional Project-specific labor analyses of what is necessary to construct the Terminal
(ECONorthwest, 2012; see Appendix 5A). Oregon LNG expects to hire construction contractors that

                                                                     OREGON LNG EXPORT PROJECT

use mostly union labor. Therefore, given the large pool of available labor from trade unions, it is
estimated that of the 2,755 construction positions, 90 percent or 2,480 positions will be the result of
hires within Oregon and Washington. Local hires may travel to the site from areas such as Portland
and surrounding suburbs, and nearby counties such as Clatsop and Columbia in Oregon and Cowlitz
and Wahkiakum in Washington. It is anticipated that some workers will come directly from Clatsop
County. Some of the construction tasks will require workers with specialized skills such as the ability
to weld stainless steel pipe. Some of the workers who construct the LNG facilities are likely to
continue working on the proposed Pipeline installation. Based on estimates from CH2M HILL, the
payroll during construction of the Bidirectional Terminal is anticipated to total approximately $455.6
million annually (ECONorthwest, 2012; see Appendix 5A).
Operation of the Bidirectional Terminal will generate 643 new permanent jobs in Clatsop County. Of
those, 147 will work for Oregon LNG directly for an average annual wage of $96,000, and
approximately 266 jobs will be created elsewhere in the county due to increased demand for goods
and services by Oregon LNG. These additional jobs will include shipping and marine aspects of the
Bidirectional Project (e.g., marine pilots, longshoremen), as well as utility and municipal workers,
and others. Another 230 jobs will be created elsewhere in the county as a result of the additional
spending of incomes from direct hires at the Bidirectional Terminal. In addition, the Bidirectional
Project will generate additional income for local business owners through the increased spending by
direct hires (see Appendix 5A).

5.2.1.3 Payroll and Material Purchases During Construction
Construction of the Bidirectional Project will have a positive effect on the economies of the
individual counties where it is located, as well as on the overall economy of Oregon. Table 5.2-1
provides a breakdown of estimated construction expenditures for labor costs, material purchases, and
expenditures by construction works. The table also shows the total amount that will be spent on
construction compared to the total output of the economies in each county. Output is the sum of
intermediate purchases (i.e., goods and services that businesses purchase from other businesses) and
value added. In Table 5.2-1, total output was calculated by ECONorthwest using IMPLAN 2010 base
data and adjusted for 2012 dollars.

Pipeline. Data on construction payroll and expenditures for the Bidirectional Pipeline are shown in
Table 5.2-1. The construction expenditures shown in the table will improve the combined economies
of Oregon and Washington. Beneficial impacts will result from payments for construction materials,
as well as for the rental spaces for field offices and temporary storage of construction materials. The

lease and/or rental of facilities, office, and construction equipment will result in additional
expenditures within some of the counties to be affected by the Bidirectional Project.
Terminal. Construction of the Bidirectional Terminal is expected to require 4 years. Table 5.2-1
shows that the expected construction payroll for the Terminal will be approximately $2.266 billion, or
approximately $567 million annually ($2,266 billion / 4 years). The majority of this workforce will
consist of skilled laborers specializing in heavy construction and will include both local and nonlocal
workers. Construction will spend approximately $3.402 billion in materials and equipment.
Table 5.2-1 shows that the total construction spending for the Bidirectional Terminal is 0.6 percent of
the annual output in Oregon and Washington. Including the Bidirectional Pipeline, construction
spending would total 0.7 percent of annual output. Thus, the Bidirectional Project will greatly benefit
the regional economy.

5.2.1.4 Personal Income Tax Revenue
In Oregon, the incomes of construction workers are taxed regardless of the worker's residency
(Washington has no personal income tax). ECONorthwest estimated Oregon personal income tax
receipts for all work performed in the state. These include three categories of labor income. The first
is direct labor, which is the work done at the construction site for the Bidirectional Terminal and
Pipeline. The second is indirect labor, or the incomes earned at businesses as a result of construction.
The income of a steel worker in Portland who makes material for the Terminal is an example. The
third is induced labor, which is income earned elsewhere in the economy as a resulting of increased
consumer spending. The income of a grocer in Warrenton selling food to a construction worker is an
example.
Personal income taxes resulting from all the income caused by construction would range from
$25.4 million to $56.3 million annually over the five calendar years of construction. In total,
construction would yield $219.8 million in Oregon income tax.

The analysis also estimated the personal income taxes resulting each year from the operation of
Oregon LNG. These incomes are again categorized by type. Those taxes would total approximately
$4.6 million per year for the life of the Bidirectional Project, which is at least 60 years.

5.2.1.5 Government Revenue During Construction
Construction of the Bidirectional Pipeline will also result in government revenue from the clearing
and selling of merchantable timber and related forest products. The counties, school districts, and
other taxing districts along the Bidirectional Pipeline route, as well as the Oregon Department of
Forestry (ODF), will receive revenue from the sale of timber cleared from State Forestlands per
Oregon Administrative Rule 629-035-0010. There is no state forestland crossed by the Bidirectional
Project within Washington.
The ODF specifically requested an estimate of the loss of timber production, both short- and long-
term, from State Forestlands due to development of the Bidirectional Pipeline. By "short-term" and
"long-term," ODF is understand to mean the following:
     Short-term: the loss in net present value (NPV) of the current growing stock of trees due to
     harvesting prior to the economic maturity of the trees in order to develop the Bidirectional
     Pipeline.
     Long-term: the loss in NPV of future timber production due to permanently removing acres from
     the productive forestland base.
ECONorthwest conducted two separate analyses to provide estimates of the NPV of short- and long-
term losses from timber production for the areas crossed by the Bidirectional Pipeline within the
Clatsop and Tillamook State Forests. In the first analysis, ECONorthwest estimated the NPV loss in
revenue associated with harvesting the timber (in the permanent and temporary areas) before it
reaches its maximum economic potential (i.e., short-term). In the second analysis, ECONorthwest
estimated the NPV loss in bare land or soil expectation value (SEV) of the areas kept permanently out
of timber production (long-term).
Table 5.2-4 shows the approximate areas of permanent and temporary impacts within each state
forest, which were used by ECONorthwest in their analyses. These areas reflect what is needed for
the permanent Bidirectional Pipeline right-of-way and for construction in the temporary right-of-way.
The permanent areas will remain cleared of timber for the life of the Bidirectional Pipeline and the
temporary areas for construction will return to timber production.

Short-Term Loss. Short-term losses are those associated with the current stand of trees occupying
the permanent and temporary right-of-ways. The baseline for estimating short-term loss is the NPV of
the current stand if it was allowed to grow to the point of financial maturity. This is compared to the
value of the timber being harvested today. The difference is the foregone NPV associated with
immediate conversion of the stand.
Table 5.2-5 shows the results of ECONorthwest's analysis of the present value of timber revenue
foregone by cutting for the Bidirectional Pipeline before the timber reaches its optimal economic
potential. Table 5.2-5 is based on inventory and financial information in ODF's Harvest & Habitat
Model Project, Final Report (2006). For the purposes of this report, it was assumed that the age
distribution of the affected stands is the same as the age distribution of the entire forest. For both state
forests, the overwhelming majority of trees are in the older (40 years +) age classes, at or near
financial maturity. Thus, as the estimates of foregone NPV shown in Table 5.2-5 indicate, there is not
a substantial loss in NPV associated with harvesting the acres at this time. Furthermore, the values
presented in Table 5.2-5 potentially over-estimate the foregone NPV because they do not account for
a recent change in the Department of Forestry's management goals in the Tillamook and Clatsop state
forests. In 2009, the Board of Forestry voted to decrease the long-term goal for older forest types
(from 40 to 60 percent to 30 to 50 percent). In the short run, this change increases harvest rates and
decreases the NPV of foregone revenue (ODF, 2009).

The lower and upper bounds represent the different forest management strategies that are likely being
applied to the affected acres. The lower bound represents less revenue loss because it is based on the
Habitat Conservation Plan strategy. The upper bound shows greater revenue loss as it is based on a
timber production strategy. In conclusion, the timber revenue lost due to immediate conversion of the
permanent and temporary right-of-way areas is estimated between $68,000 and $157,000.
Long-Term Loss. Long-term losses occur when forestland is permanently removed from timber
production and is equal to the NPV of all future rotations of timber grown on the land. Long-term
losses will only occur on those acres associated with the permanent right-of-way (see Table 5.2-4).
Two alternative methods were undertaken to estimate the long-term losses. First, using inventory and
forestland value data from the Northwest Oregon State Forests Management Plan (ODF, 2001), the
average SEV of an acre of forestland was computed for each state forest by dividing, respectively, the
SEV of the entire forest by the number of acres in the forest. The resulting per-acre SEV estimates
were then multiplied by the number of acres to be permanently removed from timber production to
establish the lower bound in Table 5.2-6. Second, for an upper bound estimate of the per-acre value of
forestland, timberland valuation data from the 2003 U.S. Pacific Northwest Timberland Values Based
on Recorded Transactions were used (National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries
[NCREIF], 2003). The per-acre value, $2,000, and the total estimated value of all acres permanently
removed from production represent the upper bound in Table 5.2-6. Table 5.2-6 suggests that there is
not a substantial long-term loss associated with removing the permanent areas, especially in
comparing these figures to the property taxes that will result from the Bidirectional Pipeline paid out
to counties where the state forestlands are crossed.

The lower bound in Table 5.2-6 represents the ODF's own method of valuing state forestland. The
upper bound is based on data from actual real estate transactions of forestland in the Pacific
Northwest, which results in the higher per acre value. In conclusion, the loss from maintaining these
areas as permanent Pipeline right-of-way ranges from $36,000 to $124,000.
ECONorthwest's analyses provide estimates of the loss of production on state forestlands crossed by
the Bidirectional Pipeline. However, the Pipeline will also result in the return of property taxes to the
counties where the state forest is crossed. This gain offsets the estimated loss of production described
above. Section 5.2.1.6 below provides an estimate of the property tax revenue from the Bidirectional
Pipeline where it is within state forestlands.

5.2.1.6 Property Tax Revenue at Completion
The Bidirectional Terminal will create a significant source of property tax revenue upon completion.
Oregon LNG estimates that property tax from the Bidirectional Terminal will generate approximately
$51.9 million in annual revenue using the average tax for the City of Warrenton (Table 5.2-7). These
estimates are based on current property tax rates and taxable assessed values, which are assumed to
equal the hard construction costs. Actual property taxes levied, however, will depend on tax rates,
limits, and laws at the time.

The Bidirectional Pipeline will also result in property tax revenues. Pipelines are assessed by the
counties and their assessed values are allocated according to their total mileage in each county. Table

The total estimated property tax generated by the Bidirectional Pipeline on an annual basis equals
$4,911,852. This sum includes a low of $2,823 in Washington County and a high of $2,308,929 in
Columbia County.
The same methodology described above was used to estimate property tax revenue specifically
generated by the Bidirectional Pipeline where it is proposed across state forestlands. Again, taxes are
based on current (2010-2011) property tax rates and taxable assessed values, which are assumed to
equal the hard construction costs. Actual property taxes levied, however, will depend on tax rates,
limits, and laws at the time. Table 5.2-9 shows the estimated property tax resulting from the
Bidirectional Pipeline across state forestlands. The result is a new source of annual revenue across
state forestland, which previously did not occur.

5.2.2        Housing
5.2.2.1 New Pipeline Segment
Because most construction workers will be hired on a temporary basis from areas at least an hour's
drive away, it is anticipated that the majority of the workforce will commute daily to the construction
site from the municipalities closest to each of the two spreads for the New Pipeline Segment. For
example, workers constructing the New Pipeline Segment between mileposts 47 and 87 will likely
commute from lodging in St. Helens, Woodland, or Longview. Specific occupancy data for
hotels/motels and campsites is difficult to obtain, but occupancy rates are assumed to vary depending
on the season. Hotel occupancy by the construction workers will have a positive economic influence
on lodging establishments. Impacts will be short-term because construction will occur simultaneously
within the two construction spreads. Therefore, the total number of construction workers will be
spread across the entire length of the New Pipeline Segment, which would spread the need for
housing throughout the affected area.
A shortage of hotel rooms near the Export Project site is not anticipated. During the peak tourist
season, which typically occurs between Memorial Day and Labor Day, competition for local
accommodations may rise. In the event that local motels, hotels, and campsites become booked,
suitable housing can be found in towns adjacent to the Export Project. Information about available
motels, hotels, and campsites within and near the Export Project can be found in Table 5.1-4.

5.2.2.2 Export Terminal
During construction of the Export Terminal and associated facilities, there will be approximately
2,755 average annual jobs at the Terminal within the Warrenton area over a period of 48 months. It is
anticipated that a significant number of workers will be from Clatsop County. It is assumed these

workers have existing housing. A small percentage of the workers will likely come from areas within
commuting distance but potentially outside Clatsop County. The remaining workers coming from
outside the area are expected to rent apartments, houses, or hotel/motel rooms. In addition, some
workers may decide to purchase homes as a result of the length of the construction. Housing
characteristics, including rental and owner vacancy rates, are available in Table 5.1-2. The table
shows that the rental vacancy rate in Clatsop County is approximately 10 percent. In addition, the
vacancy rate in Tillamook County (16 percent), the county directly adjacent to Clatsop, has the
highest rental vacancy rate among neighboring counties. In addition, vacancy rates obtained from the
City of Astoria for 30 area hotels, motels, and B&Bs show that during 2011 a large number of rooms
was available. Thus, the rental market should provide adequate housing for the workers from outside
the local area.
Oregon LNG is unaware of any other large development projects within the general vicinity of the
Terminal that have established construction schedules. Conversations with City of Astoria, POA, and
Clatsop County officials identified two large projects in the region. They are a new campus for
Clatsop Community College and a conference center at the POA. The community college campus has
recently been constructed, and the conference center was determined to not be economically viable at
this time. Therefore, competition for available housing during the planned timeframe for the Export
Terminal is limited to tourism at this time.

5.2.3        Property Value and Tax Implications
Property Value Implications. Oregon LNG retained ECONorthwest, an economics consulting firm,
to evaluate the potential impacts of the Oregon Pipeline on the value of adjacent and nearby
residential properties (ECONorthwest, 2008a), filed under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-
000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).
ECONorthwest concluded that, "Based on the key findings of this study, the proposed Oregon
Pipeline project would have no impact on the value of adjacent or nearby residential properties. ...the
South Mist Extension has no statistically significant or economically significant relationship with
residential property values. The findings are supported by data from Clackamas County, Washington
County, and both counties combined" (page 13). This analysis included properties directly crossed by
the Oregon Pipeline.
Property Tax Implications. Oregon LNG retained ECONorthwest to conduct research on how
property taxes will change on properties crossed by the Oregon Pipeline. The results of this research
are included in a memorandum located in Resource Report 5 filed under Docket Numbers CP09-6-
000 and CP09-7-000 and indicate that the impact on property taxes will be negligible in the case of
the permanent right-of-way and presence of the subterranean Pipeline.
Land Use Implications. Land use implications for the Terminal remain unchanged from Resource
Report 5 under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000.

5.2.4        Transportation
Oregon LNG prepared a TIS (CH2M HILL, 2012; see Appendix 5B) that analyzes the existing
conditions and associated impacts of traffic anticipated from development of the Export Terminal and
New Pipeline Segment. The transportation system will be affected by construction and by the travel
of construction workers and equipment. Construction vehicles will be in operation during morning
and evening peak times on Monday through Saturday. Oregon LNG will consult with the Oregon
Department of Transportation (ODOT) to successfully mitigate for the addition of roadway traffic as
a result of construction of the Export Project.

The Export Project is accessible by state roadways as shown in Table 5.1-7. Temporary and minor
disruptions of traffic flow and pattern are expected to result from construction of the Export Project.
Impacts on marine traffic are discussed in Section 5.2.7.

5.2.4.1 New Pipeline Segment
Construction will occur within two spreads simultaneously along the New Pipeline Segment route,
over a period of approximately 4 years. Impacts to transportation remain unchanged from Resource
Report 5, filed under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).

5.2.4.2 Export Terminal
During Export Terminal construction, there will be an increase in heavy truck traffic and workforce
traffic to the site. King Avenue, which is identified by Clatsop County as a right-of-way for a public
street, will be used to access the Terminal site from Warrenton-Astoria Highway and the Oregon
Coastal Highway (U.S. 101/26). Subsection 5.1.4 explains that the existing ADT along Warrenton-
Astoria Highway 105 ranges between 8,700 vehicles west of King Avenue and 2,350 vehicles south
of Harbor Street on Marlin Avenue. The ADT on U.S. 101 ranges between 13,950 vehicles (west of
Marlin Avenue) and 19,300 vehicles on the Youngs Bay Bridge from Astoria. During the peak month
of construction, Oregon LNG expects that an average of approximately 1,235 workers will be onsite
per day. Approximately 55 trucks per day will be required for construction of the LNG tanks during
the peak months, while between 52 (assuming a 10-hour work day) and 65 (assuming an 8-hour work
day) trucks per hour will be necessary for excavation and dredging for marine facilities
(approximately 3 months of construction). These estimates were developed using the construction
schedule of the tasks required for the Export Terminal. These additional construction vehicles will
increase the amount of traffic on local surface roads throughout the duration of construction,
primarily between Warrenton and Astoria, Oregon, and the site. However, the amount of Project-
related traffic during the construction period is a small percentage when combined with existing
traffic on the surrounding roadways. Oregon LNG will encourage carpooling to reduce the passenger
traffic to and from the site. A new 20-foot-wide gravel road on the south side of the site will provide
primary access to the Export Terminal during construction and operation.
The POA plans to develop the ESP area south of the Export Terminal in the future. To develop this
area, King Avenue, which currently bisects the peninsula and provides direct access to the Export
Terminal location, would have to be closed. Therefore, access to the Terminal area on the northern tip
is proposed via a new road that extends north from Harbor Street, then turns west parallel to and just
north of Harbor Street, and finally turns north along the east bank of the Skipanon River to the
Terminal.
ODOT designated U.S. 101 as a State National Highway System highway in the 1999 Oregon
Highway Plan (OHP). This roadway, which is functionally classified as an arterial in the City of
Warrenton Transportation System Plan (TSP) (2004), includes bicycle facilities in both directions of
travel. The main function of U.S. 101 is to provide mobility; therefore, access to this roadway is
limited and speed limits are usually greater than or equal to 45 miles per hour (mph). U.S. 101 in the
vicinity of the study area is posted at 45 mph. Fort Stevens Highway 104 (also locally known as Main
Avenue in the vicinity of Harbor Street) and Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 (portions of Harbor
Street and Marlin Avenue) are designated by the OHP as district highways and as collector facilities
in the Warrenton TSP. Collector streets provide connections between local roads and arterials, usually
have more access locations, and operate at moderate speeds. Harbor Street (between Marlin Avenue
and U.S. 101) is classified as a collector roadway in the Warrenton TSP.

RESOURCE REPORT 5--SOCIOECONOMICS

The TIS includes an analysis of seven intersection locations, all within the city of Warrenton. Three
of the intersections are located on U.S. 101. These intersections are signalized and maintained by
ODOT. The remaining study intersections are located along Harbor Street and are unsignalized. All
but one of the study intersections (the intersection of Harbor Street and Neptune Avenue) occur on a
state highway. The study intersections are as follows:
     Harbor Street (Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105) and Main Avenue (Fort Stevens Highway 104)
     Harbor Street (Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105) and King Avenue
     Harbor Street (Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105) and Marlin Avenue
     Harbor Street and Neptune Avenue
     U.S. 101 and Harbor Street
     U.S. 101 and Neptune Avenue
     U.S. 101 and Marlin Avenue
Because all but one of the study intersections involve a state highway, the TIS uses the mobility
standards from the 1999 OHP, expressed as volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratios based on facility
classification, area type, and speed zones for roadways intersecting state highways. The TIS reports
the v/c ratio, level of service, and delay time at each study intersection for existing conditions (2012),
the year of peak construction (2015), the year of opening (2018), and a 20-year horizon year analysis
(2032).
The transportation effects of the Export Terminal were analyzed using vehicle truck and personnel
trips necessary during the peak of construction (2015) estimated from trips generated by similar LNG
import terminals. Operational vehicle trips for the year of opening (2018) and a 20-year horizon
(2032) were also estimated in the same manner.
The TIS concluded that the intersection of Harbor Street and King Avenue will perform worse than
the OHP mobility standard with the addition of Export Terminal operational trips. However, this
intersection will perform better with the Export Terminal under the future mitigated scenario
presented in the TIS because traffic would be redirected away from King Avenue to a new connection
at Marlin Avenue. The intersection at Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue is expected to perform better
than the existing conditions and shows no further degradation of its v/c ratio, even with the addition
of Export Terminal operational trips. Furthermore, with mitigation measures, an Export Terminal
would have the following effects:
     Would not change the functional classification of an existing or planned roadway
     Would not change standards implementing the functional classification system
     Would not allow levels of development yielding levels of travel or access that are inconsistent
     with the intended functional classification of existing or planned transportation facilities
     Would not worsen the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility that is
     projected to perform below the minimum acceptable performance standard identified in the
     Warrenton TSP
Because mitigation measures will either improve or maintain traffic operations, trips attributed to
operation of the Export Terminal would not adversely affect traffic operations on the ESP with the
implementation of the mitigation measures described in the "Proposed Mitigation" section of the TIS.

5.2.5        Public Services
5.2.5.1 New Pipeline Segment
The effect of in-migration on local government expenditures and municipal services as a result of
construction of the Oregon Pipeline and New Pipeline Segment will be minimal as described in
Resource Report 5, filed under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).

5.2.5.2 Export Terminal
During construction of the Export Terminal, local government expenditures will slightly increase
within the 4-year schedule. The estimated population within the Astoria-Warrenton area is 14,500
(Astoria Warrenton Area Chamber of Commerce, 2012). Between the two cities, there are
approximately 30 paid and reserve police officers and four operating fire stations with approximately
70 paid and volunteer firefighters. The Astoria and Warrenton-Hammond school districts operate with
student-to-teacher ratios of 19.5:1 and 17.3:1, respectively. During the 4 years of construction of the
LNG facilities, the temporary addition of 2,755 construction workers may cause a strain on the
availability of local law enforcement and emergency response workers as well as a slight increase in
the number of students in the local school districts. During both construction and operation, Oregon
LNG will provide onsite security 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which will minimize dependence on
local law enforcement. The Export Project will also have an onsite firewater system with sufficient
capacity to respond to fire events within the facility boundaries, which will also minimize need for
local services.
The addition of approximately 2,755 workers on an average annual basis will create a local
population increase of about 19 percent. Because this is a temporary increase, it is not anticipated that
the local government or public services will need to hire additional support. In the event that
additional jobs are necessary within the local governments and public services, the increase in
employment levels will be a positive impact for the area. Any increase in local government
expenditures during construction will be negated by the state and local tax collected as estimated in
Section 5.2.1.4, and by local revenue created from construction expenditure and the purchase of
construction supplies. Operation of the Export Terminal will affect local government expenditures
less than construction and will be covered by annual property tax revenue as described in Section
5.2.1.5.

5.2.6        Environmental Justice
The Export Project is not expected to result in adverse, disproportionate impacts to low-income or
minority communities, including Hispanic or Native American populations.

5.2.6.1 New Pipeline Segment
The location of the New Pipeline Segment and associated facilities was chosen without preference for
or intentional impacts to any particular social or economic segment or group. The New Pipeline
Segment and facilities were sited to minimize impacts, as much as practicable, to human
considerations, engineering constraints, and environmental resources as described in Section 10.5 of
Resource Report 10.
Contractors will be required to comply with applicable equal opportunity and nondiscrimination laws
and policies. The criteria for positions will be based on qualifications without regard to age, race,
creed, or sex, and in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local employment laws and
policies.

RESOURCE REPORT 5--SOCIOECONOMICS

The New Pipeline Segment will be placed in predominantly rural, sparsely populated regions as
shown by the low number of residential and commercial areas located near the Pipeline (see
Subsection 8.1.1 in Resource Report 8). Specialized construction methods will be employed in areas
where residential structures are within 50 feet of the construction work area.
The data in Section 5.1.6 show that the Export Project will not pose any disproportional adverse
impacts on, and does not discriminate against, minority populations. Tables 5.1-12 and 5.1-13 provide
a comparison of racial/ethnic mix statistics by county and census tracts crossed by the Export Project.
A few of the tracts have a larger percentage of Hispanic populations, but the highest (census tract
001502 in Cowlitz County) is only 14 percent.
The data in Subsection 5.1.6 show that the Export Project will not pose any disproportional adverse
impacts on, and does not discriminate against, low-income populations. Tables 5.1-14 and 5.1-15
provide a comparison of poverty statistics by county and census tracts crossed by the Export Project.
Data at the county level show that the average percentage of low-income households in the Export
Project area is only slightly more than the average in the two states overall. Table 5.1-15 shows that
only one census tract surpasses the 20 percent threshold used to define low-income areas. A further
analysis of the census tract shows that the areas crossed by the New Pipeline Segment have a lower
poverty level. Thus, the Export Project does not disproportionately affect low-income populations in
this area.
On average, children under the age of 18 account for approximately 27 percent of the population
within the counties associated with the Export Project, which is similar to the Oregon and
Washington state averages as depicted in Table 5.1-18. Oregon LNG does not anticipate any adverse
impacts to children in the area as a result of the Export Project.

5.2.6.2 Export Terminal
Workforce fluctuations and demographic shifts are expected locally in the vicinity of the Export
Terminal in Clatsop County, as described in Section 5.2.5.2 of Resource Report 5 filed under Docket
Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).

5.2.7        Marine Activities
Consultations with local authorities, including the USCG, Port Authority, and Bar Pilots, are ongoing
regarding potential short-term influx of marine traffic for construction of the Project as well as
ongoing operations. In addition, a Waterway Suitability Assessment (WSA) was prepared by
Halcrow, Inc. (2008) in consultation with the USCG to analyze a multitude of elements from the
entrance of LNGCs into U.S. territorial waters through their transit to and from the Terminal,
including operations at the vessel/facility interface. The WSA was prepared in compliance with the
USCG's Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular No. 05-05 ­ Guidance on Assessing the
Suitability of a Waterway for Liquefied Natural Gas Marine Traffic (USCG, 2005).
Resource Report 11, Section 11.3, examines potential hazards associated with the Export Terminal.
The hazards would arise from failure of facility components resulting from accidents or natural
catastrophes. Resource Report 11 also evaluates the effect of such events on the reliability and safety
of the Export Project, and the procedures and design features proposed to reduce potential hazards.

5.2.7.1 Ports and Marinas in the Export Project Area
Direct impacts to operations at the POA will not occur. The only change to the information provided

pertains to the 2012 schedule for the POA provided in Subsection 5.1.7.2, which shows that only 10
cruise ships are currently scheduled.

5.2.7.2 Vessel Traffic in the Export Project Area
Although tonnages of cargo moving on the Columbia River have increased in the last few decades,
the cargo is moving on fewer vessels. As noted above (Subsection 5.1.7.2), the average number of
vessels crossing the Columbia River Bar each month has dropped by almost 50 in comparison to the
1990s. Thus, the Columbia River maritime transportation system has already demonstrated its ability
to handle the proposed two to three LNGCs per week.
The estimated 125 LNGCs per year will not represent a large percentage increase in shipping in the
Columbia River, compared to current shipping in the river. This number of new ships represents only
a 1 to 2 percent increase in bar crossings over average levels since 2000. Some ships may need to
wait for a pilot if too many arrive at the mouth of the river within the same timeframe.
Vessel traffic in the Skipanon River will not be affected except while LNGCs are docking or
undocking from the Terminal berth, as described in Resource Report 5 under Docket Numbers CP09-
6-000 and CP09-7-000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).

5.2.7.3 Commercial and Recreational Fishing
Oregon LNG does not expect to have a direct or indirect impact on the fishing industries with
construction and operation of the Export Project. Commercial and recreational fishing impacts at the
Export Project are as described in Section 5.2.7.3 under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-
000 (Oregon LNG, 2008).

5.2.7.4 Native American Fishing Treaty Rights
As described in Section 5.2.7.4 under Docket Numbers CP09-6-000 and CP09-7-000 (Oregon LNG,
2008), no significant adverse impacts on Native American fishing treaty rights are expected as a
result of LNG tanker traffic.

An Economic Impact
Analysis of the
Oregon LNG Project
in Northwest Oregon




April 9, 2012
Section I                             Introduction
                         This report summarizes an economic impact analysis of a proposed natural
                     gas project in Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington. LNG Development
                     Company, LLC (d/b/a Oregon LNG) and Oregon Pipeline Company, LLC plan to
                     build and operate liquefied natural gas ("LNG") exporting/receiving terminal and
                     natural gas pipeline (collectively, the "Oregon LNG" project). ECONorthwest
                     was retained by Oregon LNG to determine the economic impacts from the
                     construction and a typical year of full operations of the project.

      The Oregon LNG Project
                         Oregon LNG can operate as either an importer or exporter of natural gas,
                     depending on market conditions. As an importer, the terminal would receive LNG
                     from oceangoing vessels, gasify the LNG into natural gas, and send the natural
                     gas through the Oregon Pipeline onto interstate pipelines. The gas would
                     eventually be consumed by end-users mostly in the United States.

                         As an exporter, natural gas originating from domestic and Canadian wells
                     would be shipped through interstate pipelines into the Oregon Pipeline, and then
                     delivered to the LNG Terminal. There the natural gas would be cooled down into
                     liquefied natural gas and loaded onto oceangoing vessels for export.

                         Given current market conditions and the abundance of developable natural gas
                     reserves in western Canada and the United States, Oregon LNG anticipates that it
                     would operate primarily as an exporter. This analysis is based upon that model.

                         The LNG Terminal would consist of equipment to support ship berthing for
                     LNG loading and offloading, two containment LNG storage tanks, equipment to
                     vaporize imported LNG, equipment to liquefy the natural gas for export,
                     equipment to treat the natural gas prior to liquefaction, and a variety of
                     administrative and support facilities. The LNG Terminal is proposed on the East
                     Skipanon Peninsula ("ESP") in the City of Warrenton, Oregon at river mile
                     eleven ("RM 11") along the Columbia River.

                         Natural gas will flow to and from the terminal via an 86-mile long pipeline,
                     which will interconnect with downstream pipelines and markets. The 36-inch-
                     outside-diameter pipeline, buried approximately five-feet underground, will
                     extend from the LNG Terminal to the proposed point of interconnection with the
                     interstate natural gas pipeline system of Williams Northwest Pipeline Company in
                     the vicinity of the City of Woodland, Washington.

                         The pipeline also includes an electrically driven gas compressor station at
                     approximately pipeline milepost 81 on the south bank of the Columbia River in
                     Columbia County, Oregon. The aboveground compressor station ensures the
                     desired pressure is available for liquefaction.

                       Frequently Asked Questions
This section provides an executive summary of the Transportation Impact Analysis through a
set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).


Where is the project located?
The site is located along the northeast quadrant of the proposed SW Blake Street / 115th
Avenue SW intersection in Tualatin, Oregon.


What is the project land use and trip generation?
The project includes the construction of two light industrial buildings totaling approximately
100,000 gsf. The project is estimated to generate 92 trips during the weekday AM peak hour
and 97 trips during the weekday PM peak hour utilizing ITE land use 110.


What are the existing and future without-project conditions in
the study area?
The study area was defined through coordination with Washington County and the City of
Tualatin to include the intersection of 115th Avenue SW / Tualatin-Sherwood Road. During
existing and without-project conditions the study intersections currently operate within County
standards with V/C ratios below 0.99 during the weekday AM and PM peak hour.


Would the project have any transportation impacts?
With the addition of project related traffic, the intersection V/C ratio is below 0.99 for both the
weekday AM and PM peak hour during the with-project condition. The V/C ratio increases by
0.04 between without and with-project conditions.


What mitigation measures are recommended?
Specific off-site mitigation measures are not recommended nor required to reduce/offset
potential site-generated traffic impacts.

                                           Introduction
This Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) summarizes the potential transportation-related
impacts associated with the proposed Koch Corporate Center (Building 5 and 6) located in
the City of Tualatin. The analysis was conducted to evaluate the project’s impacts on
roadways and intersections within the vicinity of the site and to recommend, if necessary,
mitigation measures that would reduce or otherwise offset these impacts. This report has
been prepared in coordination with both the City of Tualatin and Washington County staff.


Project Description
The site is located along the northeast quadrant of the proposed SW Blake Street/SW 115th
Avenue intersection in Tualatin, Oregon. The project’s site vicinity is shown in Figure 1. The
primary access to the project will be via the SW 115th Avenue/Tualatin-Sherwood Road
intersection. The project includes the construction of two industrial buildings totaling
approximately 100,000 gsf. A preliminary site plan showing the subject project and access
points are included in Figure 2. The project is anticipated to be built and fully occupied by
2014.


Analysis Approach and Study Area
This analysis was prepared through coordination with City and County staff and reviewing the
City’s and Washington County’s road standard requirements. The study area was
determined based on coordination with City and County staff and includes one intersection,
SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road / SW 115th Street. Since Tualatin-Sherwood Road is
maintained by the County, the potential “Impact Area” of the project was reviewed based on
the projected average daily traffic (ADT). The intersection is operated by Washington County;
therefore Washington County standards were used for analysis.

Based on discussions with City and County staff, intersection operations are evaluated for the
existing, without-project and with-project weekday AM and PM peak hour conditions. Site-
generated impacts are determined by comparing without- and with-project traffic conditions.

Transportation Impact Analysis
Koch Corporate Center (Building 5 and 6)                                                July 2012



                 Existing and Baseline Conditions
This section describes both existing conditions and 2014 without-project conditions within the
identified study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the roadway network,
planned improvements, existing and forecasted without-project volumes, traffic operations,
and non-motorized facilities.


Roadway Network
The primary roadways within the vicinity of the site include the following:

SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road is a two-lane major arterial with a posted speed limit of 45
miles per hour (mph). Traffic signals exist at major intersections near the site including SW
115th Street / SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road and SW Avery Road / Tualatin-Sherwood Road.
Bike lanes are provided near the project site. Sidewalks are provided where development
has occurred.

SW 115th Avenue is a two-lane local commercial industrial roadway with a posted speed
limit of 25 mph. Sidewalks are located where development has occurred.


Planned Improvements
The City of Tualatin Transportation System Plan (June 2001) and the Washington County
2020 Transportation Plan (October 2002) were reviewed to identify any planned
improvements within the 2014 horizon year. One improvement identified within the Tualatin
Transportation System Plan is within the study area. This improvement includes the
extension of SW 115th Avenue south to McCamant Road. This improvement is not
scheduled to be completed within the study period and therefore was not included in the
analysis.


Traffic Volumes
Weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersection were collected in
March 2012. The existing weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in
Figure 3. The detailed traffic count worksheets are provided in Appendix A.

Consistent with other studies in the area, an annual growth rate of 3 percent was utilized for
estimating future without-project traffic volumes. In addition to an annual growth rate, five
pipeline projects were included in the 2014 without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour
traffic volumes. The pipeline projects include: 115th Commerce Park, Pacific Coast Fruit,
Powin Phase 2, Tualatin Business Park (92 percent occupied), and Itel Corporate Center.
Figure 3 illustrates the resulting 2014 without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic
volumes.

Traffic Operations
A level of service (LOS) analysis was conducted for the study area intersections for the
weekday AM and PM peak hour. The signalized intersections were analyzed using Synchro
7.0. This software program provides an analysis based on methodologies presented in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (Transportation Research Board, 2000 Edition).

LOS values range from LOS A, which indicates good operating conditions with little or no
delay, to LOS F, which indicates extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. LOS is
measured in terms of total average intersection delay for signalized and all-way stop-
controlled intersections. A more detailed explanation of LOS criteria is provided in
Appendix B.

Existing and without-project (2014) LOS results are summarized in Table 1 and LOS
worksheets are provided in Appendix C. The signal timing splits and offsets were optimized
during the without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour.

The study intersection is under Washington County jurisdiction. Washington County has
identified their LOS standard as a volume-to-capacity ratio equal to or less than 0.99 for the
overall intersection. Since the Tualatin-Sherwood Road is a County facility, the Washington
County standard is being considered. Based on discussions with County staff, the use of the
peak hour volumes with the peak hour factor satisfies the first and second hour operational
standards defined by the County.

Non-Motorized Facilities
Non-motorized facilities exist within the study area in the form of sidewalks and bike lanes.
Bike lanes are provided along SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road.


Traffic Safety
Collision data was reviewed and summarized at 115th Avenue SW / Tualatin-Sherwood
Road. This includes data between 2008 and 2011 and is shown in Table 2. Accident data
received from the State is shown in Appendix D.

1. Collisions per year based on average between 2008 and 2011.


As shown in Table 2, collisions at the intersection of 115th Avenue SW / Tualatin-Sherwood
Road total approximately three per year. The most frequent collision type was rear end
collisions.

Per Washington County requirements, a benefit-cost analysis was completed to determine if
a capacity improvement is necessary based on the collision history at the intersection. A
benefit to cost analysis of the collisions compared to a potential capacity improvement was
completed using guidelines within the Determining Traffic Safety Improvements Under The
Traffic Impact Fee Ordinance (July 1986). As discussed in this document, if the benefit-cost
ratio is less than 1.0, no improvements are required to offset the impacts of collisions.

The capacity improvement considered for 115th Avenue SW / Tualatin-Sherwood Road was
an additional westbound left. The benefit to cost ratio was calculated using the following
formula:

B/C = (Annual Benefits)*(Series Present Worth Factor (20 yrs @ 10%) / Estimated Improvement Cost

Annual Benefit = $21,773 (Collisions included 4 Property Damage Only and 6 injury)
Improvement Cost = Approximately $200,000
Present Worth Factor = 8.5136

B/C = 0.93

Based on the Benefit-cost ratio of less than 1.0, no improvement is triggered through a review
of the safety analysis.

                                             Project Impacts
This section of the report documents the site-generated impacts of the proposed project on
the surrounding roadway network, including impacts to traffic volumes and intersection
operations. Project-generated weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are estimated,
distributed, and assigned to the surrounding roadway network. Future with-project traffic
volumes are projected and intersection peak hour operations are evaluated. 2014 without-
and with-project conditions are compared in order to identify transportation impacts
associated with the project.


Trip Generation
The following trip generation estimates were developed using rates identified in the ITE Trip
Generation Manual, 8th Edition. The trip generation rates used for the proposed site are
based on ITE Land Use #110 (General Light Industrial). Trip generation estimates for the
weekday AM and PM peak hour and average daily conditions are noted in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, based on ITE rates the weekday AM and PM peak hour trip generation
totals 92 and 97 net new trips, respectively.


Trip Distribution
A review of the existing turning movement counts at the SW 115th Avenue/SW Tualatin-
Sherwood Road intersection and anticipated travel patterns to/from the site were used to
generate the distribution of project trips within the study area. In general, 35 percent of the
trips are oriented to/from the west and 65 percent of the trips are oriented to/from the east.
Figure 4 illustrates the trip distribution and assignment of project trips within the study area.


Traffic Volumes
Year 2014 with-project traffic volumes were estimated by adding site-generated traffic
volumes and year 2014 without-project traffic volumes. The resulting weekday AM and PM
peak hour 2014 with-project traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 5.

Traffic Operations
The with-project analysis reflects the project impacts of adding additional project related trips
to the study intersections. The results of the LOS analysis are summarized in Table 4. The
results of the 2014 without-project analyses have also been included as a comparison. The
signal timing was optimized during the with-project weekday AM and PM peak hour. Levels of

As shown in Table 4, intersection V/C ratio is below 0.99 for both the weekday AM and PM
peak hour during the with-project condition. The V/C ratio increases by 0.03 and 0.04between
without- and with-project conditions for the weekday AM and PM peak hours, respectively.


Queuing Analysis
A queuing analysis focusing on the westbound left-turn lane was performed at the 115th
Avenue SW / Tualatin-Sherwood Road intersection for the weekday AM and PM peak hour
with-project conditions using Poisson queuing methodology. Since the V/C ratio for the
westbound left-turn lane is less than 1.0, the use of the Poisson methodology is appropriate
and meets Washington County standards. An average vehicle length of 25 feet was assumed
in the calculations. This vehicle length is representative of the mix of cars and trucks
anticipated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.

The existing turn pocket length for the westbound left-turning movements is approximately
290 feet. Table 5 shows the results of the queuing analysis for the westbound-left turning
movement at 115th Avenue SW / Tualatin-Sherwood Road. Detailed worksheets are shown

As shown in Table 5, the queues during both the weekday AM and PM peak hour are 110
feet and 250 feet, respectively, and are anticipated to be accommodated within the existing
turn pocket length.

                  Findings and Recommendations
This transportation impact study summarizes the project traffic impacts of the proposed Koch
Corporate Center development. The following outlines the general findings of the study.

          The project includes the construction of two industrial buildings totaling
           approximately 100,000 gsf.
          The project is estimated to generate 92 weekday AM peak hour trips and 97
           weekday PM peak hour trips.
          The study intersection is anticipated to operate equal to or below a V/C ratio of
           0.99, within Washington County standards for both the weekday AM and PM peak
           hour.
          Specific off-site mitigation measures are not required to reduce/offset the potential
           site-generated traffic impacts as all locations comply with local agency
           requirements.

Appendix B:   LOS Criteria
                                          Highway Capacity Manual, 2000

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

                     Average Control Delay            General Description
Level of Service           (sec/veh)                  (Signalized Intersections)

        B                     >10 - 20                Stable Flow (slight delays)
        C                     >20 - 35                Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                             Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait through
                              >35 - 55
                                                      more than one signal cycle before proceeding)
        E                     >55 - 80                Unstable flow (intolerable delay)
        F                       >80                   Forced flow (jammed)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

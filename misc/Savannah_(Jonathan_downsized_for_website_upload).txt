EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The SR 69/128 Corridor Study was initiated by the City of Savannah, in conjunction
with the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) utilizing TDOT’s
Tennessee Community Transportation Planning Grant (CTPG) funds. The study
developed projects that would meet the City’s vision and goals for the study. The
three goals for the project were:
      Goal 1: Enhance the functionality of the routes for all users through
      geometric and operational improvements to address access management
      issues, capacity deficiencies and safety concerns.
      Goal 2: Provide for the efficient movement of people and goods from
      developing industrial and commercial areas south of Savannah into the city.
      Goal 3: Ensure compatibility of future development with the transportation
      network through appropriate land use planning.
The study area includes a portion of the SR 69/128 corridors including areas within
the City of Savannah and Hardin County. It begins at the intersection of SR 128
and SR 206, north to SR 15, east to SR 69, and ends at the intersection of SR
69 and SR 206.
The first step of the SR 69/SR 128 Corridor Study was a thorough review of existing
data and a public input session to solicit input about the issues in the study area.
Next, peak-hour turning movement traffic volumes were collected at 30 key
locations throughout the study area. Concurrently, an inventory of basic roadway
information was compiled for use in the traffic analyses.
Capacity analysis indicated six intersections operated poorly in the morning and
three performed poorly in the afternoon. Future traffic projections to the 2040
planning horizon year were made for intersections in the study area based on
anticipated growth rates provided by TDOT. Based on this information traffic on
corridors was not expected to grow more than 5% over the 25-year period on either
corridor. Even under the added growth scenario, no additional intersections are
anticipated to perform at unacceptable levels-of-service.
The analysis also considered crash history based on review of crash data provided
by TDOT for the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. The majority
of the crashes analyzed involved rear end accidents, the second highest type was
angle crashes, and the third most prominent type of crash was “No Collision with
Vehicle.” Although bicycle and pedestrian safety were named as relatively high-
ranking concerns from the public input session, there were no recorded crashes
involving these users during the analysis period. There were no bike lanes and
few sidewalks in the study area at the time of data collection which would curtail




                                                                                  4
usage of the corridor by these user groups. A preliminary planning level
environmental screening was conducted for areas along the study corridors to
identify potential environmental constraints. No environmental issues were
identified that would impact recommendations.
The study included two public meetings as well as a presentation to the Planning
Commission which was also open to the public. At the first public meeting the
Study Team sought information on the perceived issues within the corridors. At
the Planning Commission meeting draft recommendations were prioritized. At the
final public meeting feedback was requested on proposed recommendations. The
feedback received indicated that local officials and the general public were
supportive of the recommendations.
The CTPG program specifically calls for studies to consider recommendations to
address land use and access management, identify transportation improvements,
and serve as an overall guide for future implementation. The land use planning
suggestions are intended to guide zoning and land development decisions
including access management policies for new development, as well as, for
retrofitting existing access; spot improvement plan address specific safety and/or
operational issues; and new connectors and corridor projects require right‐of‐way
acquisition and more extensive construction. The land use recommendations
included the following items:

      Short-Term: Use Access Management as a Land Use Strategy
      Short-Term: Adopt Traffic Impact Analysis Requirements
      Mid Term Action: Adopt Subdivision Regulations
      Mid-Term Action: Adopt goals to guide all land use decisions
      Long-Term: Adopt a Comprehensive Plan
The recommended transportation improvements are included in Figure E-1 and in
Table E-2 below. The priorities for the project are based upon the benefits derived
from the project, as well as, impact as indicated by local officials.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Savannah and the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT)
initiated the SR 69/128 Corridor Study in March 2016 after the City made a
successful application for Tennessee Community Transportation Planning Grant
(CTPG) funds. This document identifies the vision and goals for the study and
presents the findings of the study team in the form of a data inventory, existing
conditions review, traffic analysis, future conditions projections, and
recommendations for improvements and policy guidance. An overview of public
involvement is also included.
Savannah, located in southwestern Tennessee, is a popular destination for tourists
and retirees due to its close proximity to the Tennessee River and other
recreational sites. The City has all the charm and amenities expected by both
groups with the exception of the transportation infrastructure. Like most cities,
Savannah is very car-centric, with virtually no safe biking facilities, no public
transportation, and incomplete, missing or inaccessible sidewalks. Because of the
City’s desire to continue to attract retirees and tourists, these multimodal
alternatives would further enhance the City’s appeal as a destination.
Both SR 128 and SR 69 are important arterials in Savannah, Hardin County and
West Tennessee. The two corridors provide connectivity to and from SR 15 (US
Hwy 64), which is the primary east‐west arterial across the southern part of West
and Middle Tennessee. The corridors provide key connectivity to industrial and
recreational areas, as well as, activity areas in the adjacent states.
The corridor study and resultant plans will preserve and enhance the operational
and safety performance of the SR‐128 and SR 69 routes in and around Savannah.
The greatest impact of the study on the state transportation system will be
preservation of roadway capacity through greater compatibility between future
development and the transportation system.
Traffic congestion and safety are primary concerns for citizens of Savannah,
particularly in the downtown area along SR 15/Main Street and along SR
128/Pickwick Street near the schools. Outside of school arrival and dismissal
times, most of the study area south of downtown is not congested. South of
downtown, traffic is generally only restricted on both SR 128 (Pickwick Street) and
SR 69 (Florence Road) by turning vehicles (especially left turns) and oversized
vehicles. However, during the evening peak hours backups occur along, not only
along SR 128 and SR 69 in the downtown area, but also along SR 15 (Main Street)
and US 64 (Wayne Road). A major contributing factor to this congestion is the
relatively short left-turn lanes and the short spacing between signals in this area,
which create gridlock at this time of day.




                                                                                  8
This gridlock, coupled with the difficulties in turning left at some intersections,
poses safety concerns for motorists. At the location of the schools concerns
abound due to the congestion, increased turn movements from many driveways
and streets, and presence of students either walking down SR 128 or crossing the
street without the benefit of a signalized crosswalk.
Two tools that can assist communities in the development of safe and attractive
transportation are access management plans and land use plans. Access
management plans impact safety by controlling the placement and access of
driveways. By consolidating the length or number of driveways, it becomes safer
for vehicles to enter a property and for cyclists and pedestrians to pass by a
property by reducing conflict points with vehicles. Much of the SR 69 corridor and
some parts of the SR 128 corridor lack access control and have curb openings
along the entire frontage. Properly implemented, access management measures
not only enhance safety, but can add to the attractiveness of roadway facilities.
Land use and zoning allow for compatible uses of property next to one another.
Zoning approvals are generally tied to transportation improvements especially
sidewalks, controlled entrances and turn lanes, which are needed to improve the
capacity and safety of the transportation system based upon the additional impacts
of new development.

1.1 Study Project Area
The study area includes a portion of the SR 128/ SR 69 corridors beginning at the
intersection of SR 128 and SR 206, north to SR 15, east to SR 69, and ending at
the intersection of SR 69 and SR 206. The study area includes areas within the
City of Savannah and Hardin County. A detailed map of the study area is included
as Figure 1.1.




                                                                                 9

1.2 Grant Application Background

The purpose of the grant
application was to seek funds for a
study to identify strategies to
improve multimodal transportation
operations within the study area for
vehicular     traffic,   pedestrians,
bicyclists and freight movement.
Specifically, the study would analyze
the corridors to identify deficiencies and develop improvement strategies for:
         Safety improvements at intersections and identified high accident
          locations
         Operational improvements at critical areas
         Accommodation of all travel modes as appropriate
         Access management on developed properties
         Land use plans for undeveloped properties
         General roadway capacity improvements
The benefits to the community will take the form of visible, near‐term improvements
as well as longer‐ term improvements through the corridor planning and land‐use
plan components. Immediate benefits will come from operational modifications and
minor construction projects for spot improvements.
The intent of this corridor study is to develop four distinct but related plans: a land‐
use plan, an access management plan, spot improvement plans, and an overall
corridor plan.
          The land use plan portion of the study can be presented to local planning
           authorities for adoption immediately upon conclusion of the study. Once
           adopted, the land‐use plan will guide zoning and land development
           decisions as the subject properties develop throughout the life of the
           plan.
          The access management plan will be implemented both through
           adoption of access management policies for new development along the
           corridor, as well as, retrofit of existing access as a series of small
           projects as funding is available or when opportunities present
           themselves through redevelopment of properties abutting the routes.
          The spot improvement plans include both operational improvements, as
           well as, slightly more involved projects, which may require right‐of‐way




                                                                                     11
          acquisition and more extensive construction than the access
          management projects. The study will provide adequate information
          regarding these projects, including functional plans and cost estimates,
          to allow them to be developed either as locally funded projects, through
          the TDOT Locally Managed Projects process, or through traditional
          TDOT project development channels.
         The overall corridor plan will be used to guide implementation of the
          other phases to ensure that future improvements are done in a way that
          is logical for the planned future development of the corridor.

1.3 Vision
The vision of the Savannah SR128/69 Corridor Study is to develop a
comprehensive transportation plan for the corridors that addresses current
deficiencies in capacity and safety, provides guidance for improvements to
address existing access management issues, and creates a framework to guide
future development and public investment through land use policy and access
management policy for the subject routes.

1.4 Goals
Goal 1: Enhance the functionality of the routes for all users through geometric and
operational improvements to address access management issues, capacity
deficiencies and safety concerns.
          The SR 69 and SR 128 corridors suffer from recurring congestion due
          to inadequate capacity, lack of turn lanes, and poor access
          management. Design of street intersections in several locations creates
          serious operational and safety concerns. The plan will identify
          deficiencies and develop both near-term and long-term solutions to
          address those issues.


Goal 2: Provide for the efficient movement of people and goods from developing
industrial and commercial areas south of Savannah into the city.
          SR 128 and SR 69 are both important arterials in Savannah/Hardin
          County, providing links from the City to the Savannah-Hardin County
          Airport, the Florence/Muscle Shoals, Alabama area to the southeast,
          and Pickwick Dam and the industrial facilities along Yellow Creek and




                                                                                12
          the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in Mississippi. The plan will
          address improvements needed to support and enhance the ability of the
          corridor to accommodate anticipated growth in demand in these areas.
Goal 3: Ensure compatibility of future development with the transportation network
through appropriate land use planning.
          In the southern portion of the study area, traffic operations are presently
          not a problem since much of the abutting property is currently
          undeveloped. However, given the presence of the Savannah/Hardin
          County Airport, major gas and electric transmission lines, and access to
          the Tennessee River, there is a high potential for rapid development by
          commercial, industrial, or residential land uses. The plan will develop
          land-use policy guidance and access management guidance for these
          areas to ensure that development occurs in a way that is integrated with
          the ability of the transportation network to support the increasing
          demand.

1.5 Study Team
Individuals representing TDOT and the City of Savannah comprised the Study
Team. A consultant team of Neel-Schaffer, Inc., Younger Associates and Quality
Counts assisted in the process. TDOT representatives included Calvin Abram
and Nicole Seymour from the Office of Community Transportation. The City’s
representative on the project was Tom Smith, Project Manager for the City of
Savannah. The consultant leads at Neel-Schaffer were Barry Alexander, PE,
PTOE, and Karen Mohammadi, PE, AICP, PTOE.




                                                                                  13
2. DATA COLLECTION AND INVENTORY
The first step of the SR 69/SR 128 Corridor Study was a thorough review of existing
data pertaining to the road network and collection of traffic counts at key
intersections and driveways.

2.1 Corridor Description
SR 128/Pickwick Street
SR 128 within the study limits is a two‐lane roadway with traffic volumes ranging
from 11,370 vehicles per day at the northern end of the study area to 4,360
vehicles per day near the southern end of the study area. Sections of two‐way left‐
turn lane are present near Hardin County High School and near the northern end
of the study area from Malcomb Street to SR 15 but otherwise it is predominantly
two‐lane cross section. The roadway is a rural section (no curb‐and‐gutter)
throughout most of its length with a posted speed limit ranging from 35 mph near
downtown Savannah to 55 mph in the more rural sections. This corridor has narrow
shoulders of less than two feet in the county and widening to full, eight foot
shoulders in the city. The terrain is rolling, particularly to the south. There are no
major horizontal curve issues with the largest horizontal curve deflection being 20
degrees. No bicycle lanes or significant reaches of sidewalk are present, although
pedestrians are often seen on the corridor. The corridor has two signalized
intersections at Water Street and at SR 15 (Main Street).
Key properties include River City Concrete Plant, the Hardin County Library, Parris
Elementary School, Hardin County Middle School, Hardin County High School and
numerous large churches. A major reconstruction project was underway during
the course of the study to widen the corridor from SR 15/Main Street south to Opel
Loop from two lanes to five lanes including a center turn lane, sidewalks, and
shoulders that could accommodate bicyclists. Construction plans exist to widen
the corridor in the future from Opel Loop to the City/county line. Table 2.1 shows

SR 69/Florence Road
SR 69 within the study limits is generally a two‐lane roadway with traffic volumes
ranging from 9,380 vehicles per day near the intersection with SR 15 in Savannah
to 3,100 vehicles per day near the southern end of the study area. The road is two‐
lane, with a rural section (no curb‐and‐gutter) throughout most of its length. No
bicycle lanes or significant reaches of sidewalk are present. The posted speed limit
ranges from 35 mph near the intersection with SR‐15 to 50 mph outside of the
Savannah city limits. Shoulders are generally less than two feet wide throughout
the corridor. SR 69 also has a rolling terrain in the south. The corridor has three
signalized intersections, one at SR 15/US 64, one at Water Street and one at
Higgins Drive/Freewill Lane.




                                                                                                            15
The north section of the corridor is fairly heavily lined by commercial and light
industrial uses. Key facilities along the corridor include the Hardin County
Industrial Park, East Hardin Elementary, and the Savannah Health Care and
Rehabilitation. The Savannah/Hardin County Airport and Clayton Homes are
located just off the corridor near Airport Road. Clayton Homes use wide load semi-
trucks along SR 69 to transport manufactured houses. Table 2.2 shows the
roadway features for the SR 69 corridor by segment.

2.2 Connectors
The number of connector routes between SR 128 and SR 69 are good, but their
usefulness in carrying traffic is limited due to roadway widths and surrounding land
uses, as well as, the access points at each end. There are thirteen cross streets
as shown in Figure 2.1. At the southernmost end of the study area is SR
226/Airport Road. Airport Road is a two lane road with primarily residential land
uses. Once SR 128 is reconstructed, it is anticipated that more trucks from Clayton
Homes and from the Industrial Park will use SR 128 instead of SR 69.

Cross access between the corridors is lacking near the Industrial Park. Dodd Road
off SR 128 connects to Discount Drive at the Industrial Park entrance. Dodd Drive
is very narrow, has rough pavement conditions, adjacent ditches, and two ninety
degree horizontal turns. It is difficult for cars to pass one another on this road and
impossible for trucks to pass any other vehicles. While there is no direct access
to the Industrial Park from Dodd Road, the layout of the Industrial Park would allow
for additional access points to be developed here relatively easy. In fact, it appears
that some vehicles may have previously accessed the road by crossing the
unpaved shoulder.




                                                                                                    16
The next connector is One Stop Drive. This two lane roadway provides very good
access between SR 128 and SR 69. One Stop Drive primarily serves residential
traffic, but is also used as a through route for trucks likely coming from the Industrial
Park. Just north of One Stop is Walkertown Drive. It is also two lanes and serves
residential traffic.

To the north of Walkertown Drive is Higgins Road. East Hardin Elementary School
is located on the southeast corner of SR 69 and Higgins Road. This road is lined
with homes and serves residential and school traffic. A signalized intersection at
Higgins makes this an attractive connector for those drivers coming from SR 128.
The road is also relatively short and straight.

Eureka Street is the next connector. This is a popular connector for those wishing
to access the schools on SR 128, as well as, the Hardin County Library. It is
located just north of Parris Elementary School and Hardin County Middle School
and just south of Hardin County High School. This road is heavily used by school
traffic. Ranch Street is also a popular connector for school traffic. It is located
directly across from the High School. During the morning school arrivals and
afternoon departure this road is very busy and experiences major backups at both
intersections. Neither intersection is signalized. Visibility is not good for vehicles
turning left from Ranch Street onto SR 128 or SR 69. Poor access management
at this location leads to vehicles cutting across the gas station’s lot. In addition,
the lot blends with the intersection. Overhead utility lines running along the road,
a utility power pole on the corner, and a gas station at the SR 69 intersection may
make any improvements difficult or expensive.

To the north of Ranch Street are Lewis and Hickory Streets, which also provide
access to Kroger and the Tennessee Valley Electric Co-Op. To the north of these
streets is Malcomb Street. Malcomb Street is a popular connector since it also
connects to Pinhook Drive/SR 203 and, therefore, provides access to east
Savannah. Neither end is signalized despite the volume of cross traffic at SR 69.

Water Street is the next connector and provides access to a major shopping
center, to Wayne Street and to north Savannah. Water Street is the designated
truck route used to keep heavy vehicles off of Main Street. It has signalized
intersections with both SR 128, Wayne Street and SR 69. The grade at SR 128
impacts the effectiveness of the signal at that intersection when heavy trucks are
present. Water Street has some sidewalks although there are gaps.




                                                                                      17
Figure 2.1 Corridor Connectors




                                 18
The final connector in the study area is SR 15/Main Street. This is a popular
destination since City Hall, Veterans Park, and several fast food restaurants are
located on this road. The road has two lanes in each direction and left turn lanes.
SR 15/Main Street has sidewalks in some locations, but they are not compliant
with the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) requirements.             Given the
attractiveness of the downtown shopping district immediately west of this area,
having accessible sidewalks and ramps would allow more shoppers to visit the
restaurants and other stores in the study area and provide better access to City
Hall.

2.3 Existing Traffic Conditions
In order to assess and confirm traffic conditions within the study area, traffic counts
were conducted in the hours of 7:00–9:00 AM and 4:00-7:00 PM on February 16
and February 17, 2015. The count data was conducted using video cameras and
processed in the office manually. The counts included passenger vehicles, heavy
trucks and buses, pedestrians and cyclists. The traffic count data was also used
to determine the peak hour of travel in both the morning and evening and to
calculate truck percentages. The locations of the counts are shown in Figure 2.2.
The traffic data was recorded on site and manual counts were performed using the
footage. The counts are included in Appendix B.

TDOT provided the Study Team with Average Daily Traffic for the base year (2016)
as well as the future year existing plus committed traffic (2040). The existing plus
committed network includes funded projects. These are shown in Figure 2.3 and
Figure 2.4. Based on this information traffic on SR 128 is not expected to grow
south of Walkertown Drive and is expected to grow 2.10% north of Walkertown
Drive. On SR 69 traffic is expected to grow 4.94% south of Walkertown Drive and
3.25 % north of Walkertown Drive. Traffic analyses are included in Chapter 3.




                                                                                    19

2.4 Crash Data
The next type of data collected was crash information for the study area. This
involved crashes on both SR 128 and SR 69, and other locations within the
boundaries of the study area. Crash locations are shown in Figure 2.5. Fatal
crash locations are shown in Figure 2.6. While fatal crashes do not necessarily
indicate a roadway concern, they often give insight into the public’s perception
regarding a given roadway. This crash data includes all reported crashes that
occurred over a three year period between January 1, 2013 and December 31,
2015 based on data provided by TDOT. The crash analysis is included in Chapter
3.

2.5 Multimodal Opportunities
Based on conversations with the Study Team, bike lanes and pedestrian facilities
are desired in the area to make it more attractive to tourists and residents however
there are not many current users. Completed peak period traffic counts (AM and
PM) indicated that some pedestrians are present during those hours. Table 2.3 is
a list of the pedestrian counts that indicates which side of the intersection they
were crossing. There were very few pedestrians noted except at the High School
and most of those (68) were in the PM Peak coinciding with school dismissal.
There was only one bicycle counted in the entire study area. These pedestrian
and bicycle counts were also consistent with the Study Team’s field observations.
Pedestrians were noted walking on shoulders or in areas adjacent to the roadways
including through parking lots. The current design plans for SR-128/Pickwick
Street will provide accommodations for pedestrians (sidewalks) and bikes
(shoulders), but will not include any new pedestrian signals with crosswalks.

The Hardin County School District and the City have both expressed an interest in
the addition of a traffic signal in the area of the High School that would provide for
safer pedestrian crossings and allow drivers to safely turn out of the side roads or
driveways. Both crossing the street and making safe turns will be a bigger concern
when the road is widened to five lanes.

SR-69/Florence lacks any bike or pedestrian amenities. Because the corridor has
many driveways with full access across the frontages it is not considered safe for
pedestrians and the travel speeds and very narrow shoulders make the corridor
not suitable for cyclists as well. Neither the City nor the County has a Bike and
Pedestrian Master Plan.

2.6 Existing Land Use and Zoning
The City does have a current Land Use and Zoning Map. It was recently updated
and is shown in Figure 2.7. The land use map is used by transportation planners
to determine which areas may be more likely to develop and need transportation
infrastructure support for the growth. Coupled with other statistics such as
population growth, a picture of how likely growth is to occur develops. Savannah’s
population has grown 2% since 2000. AS shown in Figure 2.8 the City’s growth
has been rather flat which is also reflected in the low traffic growth rates.
Savannah/Hardin County Industrial Park has room for expansion with nine acres
of land and two buildings available. In addition, there is another property on SR
69 that was briefly considered for a major manufacturing facility that chose to
locate elsewhere. A final key element to growth is the presence of utilities. Sewers
exist within the City limits and in the industrial park. An analysis of land use and its
impacts on transportation alternatives is included in Chapter 3.

At the onset of the study, development plans were provided to the Study Team.
These consisted of several redevelopment projects that would add little or no
additional traffic to the corridors, as well as, alternatives developed as part of a
bypass study. These are shown in Figure 2.9.

The bypass is an unfunded project and not expected to develop into a construction
project. As shown in Figure 2.9, two different locations were considered for the
bypass. Either project, if funded and constructed, would have impacted traffic on
both SR 128 and SR 69.

Of more consequence to this study are the industrial parcels discussed in the
previous section. Development at these locations could impact truck volumes and
cross connectivity between the corridors as a newly widened SR 128 may attract
more truck traffic. In addition, the shopping center at Water Street is in a prime
location for redevelopment, potentially attracting a “big-box” retailer. Should this
happen, it could significantly impact both corridors, as well as, SR 15, Water Street
and Wayne Street.

2.8 School Access
School traffic is generally a problem in most cities given the ever increasing trend
of parents electing not to use school bus transportation. The result is congestion
on the effected corridors, increases in crashes and more conflicts between
vehicles and pedestrians. Exacerbating the situation in Savannah are the facts
that three of the schools, Hardin County High School, Hardin County Middle
School, and Parris South Elementary School are located in very close proximity
along SR 128 and that the schools’ start and dismissal times are only separated
by minutes. The corridor does contain flashing reduced speed school traffic signs
that are somewhat effective. A full understanding of the each school’s traffic plans
is necessary in order to development any recommendations for this traffic issue.
However, internal circulation is beyond the scope of this study. Recommendations
for external school access as it affects the corridors is included in Chapter 5.

Hardin County High School (HCHS)

HCHS is the northern most school campus and includes the main building, several
parking lots and athletic facilities. The School District would like to add
baseball/soccer/softball fields to the campus in the future. Student parking is
located in the northern lot. Student drop offs/pick-ups takes place at the main
entrance. Due to limited on-site storage, vehicles line SR 128, primarily on the
shoulder, to wait their turn in the pick-up line. Teachers park in the south lot and
can leave from a driveway at that location or at Stadium Drive. Buses load and
unload students near the gym location and exit onto Stadium Drive. None of the
driveways at the school are signalized and there are no crossing guards to assist
with traffic control. Some parents opt not to follow school policy and pick up their
students from the Savannah Church of Christ parking lot directly across from the
school. When available, the security guard does assist the student with crossing,
but the guard is neither attired in reflective clothing nor does he carry signs and
wands to assist in stopping traffic. Figure 2.10 shows the traffic patterns at HCHS.




                                                                                 30

Parents wishing to transport their children to and from HCMS or Parris South
Elementary School access the schools via Lacefield Drive. The parents then drive
around the school to pick up or drop off their children and exit at the driveway just
south of Lacefield Drive. Previously this location had a crossing guard to assist
with traffic control. Due to the widening of the corridor the City no longer felt they
could safely control this intersection with a crossing guard. Figure 2.11 shows the
traffic patterns at HCMS.
Recommendations for traffic improvements at both schools are discussed in
Chapter 5.




                                                                                   32

3. EXISTING CONDITIONS
3.1 Traffic Analysis
To determine how well the intersections within the
study area were operating, Highway Capacity
Software was used to determine intersection delay
and the corresponding level of service (LOS). The
image to the right shows how delay corresponds
to LOS at intersections that are signalized (traffic
lights)    and      un-signalized   (stop   signs).
Intersection LOS range from A to F. Ranges A
through C represent free flowing conditions and
are considered desirable LOS. Under LOS D,
congestion is occurring, but considered tolerable.
Congestion and delay increases under LOS E to a
level that is considered at capacity. LOS F ranks as the least functional level of
traffic movement, and is considered serious congestion. The LOS levels are
illustrated in the bottom right image.

HCS intersection analyses were completed for 27 locations, including seven
signalized intersection and 20 un-signalized
locations. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show the LOS
for each intersection in the AM and PM peaks
respectively for which traffic counts were
obtained. Because most of SR 128 was under
construction during the course of the study, the
analysis for existing LOS was conducted using
proposed lane configurations from the widening
project.

Growth rates were obtained from TDOT based
upon their traffic model. On SR 128 the
maximum growth between 2016 and 2040 was
2.10% over 24 years. This growth is expected
to occur north of Walkertown Road. South of Walkertown Road no growth was
projected. On SR 69 between Airport Road and Walkertown Drive a growth rate
of 4.94% was calculated and between Walkertown Drive and Main Street the
growth rate dropped to 3.25%. These growth rates were used to determine Future
(2040) LOS for each intersection. Figures 3.3 and 3.4 show the projected LOS
for each peak respectively for the intersections on the corridors.




                                                                               34

Traffic counts and intersection design-year (2040) forecasts indicate that at five (5)
intersections the side streets are performing at an LOS of D or worse today. These
are SR128/Parris South Drive (AM and PM), SR 128/Lacefield Drive (AM and PM),
SR 128/Eureka Street (AM), SR 128/Sevier Street (AM), and SR 69/Eureka (AM).
As of 2040, without further improvements, the same five intersections in the
corridors will be performing poorly. More discussion about these intersections is
in Section 5.3.

3.2 Crash Analysis
An extensive review of the crash data, including field reviews with crash
information in hand, was completed as part of this study. The tables on the
following pages reflect the findings of the analysis. The data represents three
years of crash data history (2013-2015).

Table 3.1 shows total crashes by severity for both the study area and for Hardin
County, and Table 3.2 shows the number of total injuries/severities. The numbers
in these tables are not identical since one crash resulted in more than one
incapacitating injury. The crash severity data resonates most with the public as
crashes resulting in fatalities and serious injuries are more memorable. Roadway
geometrics did not appear to be a contributing factor in either of the fatality crashes.
One occurred on Main Street and one occurred on SR 226/Airport Road. In the six
crashes involving incapacitating injuries, three occurred at signalized intersections.
The other three occurred on SR 128/Pickwick Street in the area being
reconstructed in 2016.

The next part of the analysis involved looking at crashes by type. Given the
comments received through the public outreach efforts (see Chapter 4) about the
difficulties in making turns onto SR 128 and SR 69, as well as, the impacts of
vehicles turning left on both streets, it is not surprising that the majority of the
crashes (237) involved rear end accidents. The second highest type was angle
(124) crashes. The third most prominent type of crash was “No Collision with
Vehicle, ” which are generally single vehicle accidents that are often the results of
driver inattention, speeding and animals in the roadway such as deer. The fourth
most common type of crash is the sideswipe crash. The same direction sideswipes
crashes usually occur when a vehicle is changing lanes although it may also occur
with passing vehicles. Both types of behaviors contribute to crashes in the study
area although the crashes due to changing lanes are more prominent in the
downtown area where there are two lanes in each direction and turning lanes.

Specific countermeasures should be considered for each type of crash and are
reflected in the recommendations section of the report. Table 3.4 on the following
pages reflects countermeasure guidance provided by the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). To reduce rear end and




                                                                                  40
angle crashes at signalized intersections improvements to the signal timings and
the visibility of the traffic signals can be an effective tool. In areas where there are
no signals, but significant rear end and angle crashes, adding turn lanes and
improving curb radii can be effective in reducing crashes. Advanced warning of
signalized intersections, overhead signs and better pavement markings may help
in channeling vehicles to the proper lanes and reduce sideswipe crashes in
signalized intersection areas.
Specific recommendations are also provided in Table 3.4 for light conditions and
weather conditions. However, since 85.6% of all crashes occur in either daylight
or lighted conditions, this does not appear to be a factor in crashes in the study
area. (See Table 3.5.) Wet or foggy conditions were present for 14.2% of
crashes. While this number seems significant, the crashes were not clustered in
specific areas signifying that poor or slippery pavement conditions did not likely
play a role in the number of crashes. The exception to this was Airport Road (SR
226) where four of the ten reported crashes occurred during rainy conditions.
However, even in this location crashes were not concentrated in one specific area.
The concentration of crashes in the downtown area along Main Street are the most
prominent in the study area. This also represents the most congested part of the
study area. Improvements to the signal timings will help congestion and could
reduce crashes.
Over half of the crashes on SR 128/Pickwick Street are rear-end crashes caused
mostly by turning vehicles. The current construction project on SR 128 should
diminish the number of these crashes on the corridor in the area to be widened.
The new two-way left turning lane will also help to reduce angle crashes. However,
it should be noted that it may be more difficult for drivers to cross SR 128 with the
additional lanes and this could increase some types of crashes.
SR 69/Florence Road also experiences many rear end crashes. Over half of all
crashes on this road are rear-end crashes and a quarter are angle crashes.
Additional turn lanes and a center turning lane through the developed area of the
corridor could reduce these types of crashes.

3.3 Environmental Overview
A preliminary environmental screening for areas of land along the study corridors
was conducted on a planning level to identify potential environmental constraints
within the project area.
Potential wetlands exist along streams and in low-lying areas within the proposed
project corridor. Current and potential historic architectural structures and districts,
as well as, hazardous sites were also identified within the proposed project
corridor. Endangered and sensitive species could potentially be located within or
near the proposed project corridor and could be impacted by proposed activities.
As part of the project development for any proposed improvements in Chapter 5,
appropriate environmental reviews through state and federal agencies should be
performed to ensure these sensitive resources will not be affected as a result of
construction activities.
Maps of the environmental review are included in the Appendix C.
Right-Of-Way
The amount of land to be acquired as a result of any proposed improvements has
not yet been determined. The potential for the acquisition of more than one acre
of right-of-way and/or the displacement of any commercial or residential occupants
is still under review. Once the project limits have been determined, these criteria
along with temporary easement locations should be presented to the Tennessee
Department of Transportation (TDOT) point of contact (POC) for further
recommendations.
Streams/Wetlands
According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National
Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Digital Wetlands Mapper, no wetlands exist within the
proposed project area corridor. However, the potential exists for the presence of
wetland indicators along existing streams and in low-lying areas throughout the
project corridor.
The following streams should be evaluated for the presence of potential wetlands:
    Town Branch (SR-128, SR-15, and Water Street crossings)
    Hima Branch (SR-69 crossing)
    Ross Branch (SR-69 crossing)
    Barnhill Branch (SR-69 crossing), and
    Six unnamed tributaries (SR-128 and SR-69 crossings).
Hima Branch, Ross Branch, and Barnhill Branch flow into Horse Creek located to
the east of the study area and SR-69. Town Branch flows directly into the
Tennessee River located approximately 3,500 feet west of SR-128. The




                                                                                     47
Tennessee River is designated as a navigable waterway by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Nashville District. Obstructions to Town
Branch, as well as other crossings and low-lying areas within the project corridor,
could be subject to regulations in accordance with the Rivers and Harbors Act of
1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The USACE Nashville District
should be consulted prior to proposed corridor actions.
The study area is located in the Lower Tennessee-Beech watershed, U.S.
Geological Service (USGS) hydrologic unit code (HUC) 06040001. The Lower
Tennessee-Beech watershed is a subbasin of the Lower Tennessee basin, HUC
060400.
Endangered Species
The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) maintains
an online database of federal and state-listed rare, threatened, and endangered
species. The results of the database search are show in Table 3.7. The USFWS
and TDEC should be contacted prior to work along the corridor for a determination
of the presence of listed species along the corridor and the impact to those species
in accordance with the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, Fish and
Wildlife coordination Act, Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management,
Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, Tennessee Non-game and
Endangered or Threatened Wildlife Species Conservation Act of 1974, Tennessee
Rare Plant Protection and Conservation Act of 1985, and the Tennessee Water
Quality Control Act of 1977.

RE: Transportation Assessment Letter for the Proposed Woodburn Commercial Development –
Woodburn, Oregon

Dear Jim,

Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) prepared the following transportation assessment letter for the
proposed Woodburn Commercial development project. In 2012, we prepared a letter to support the
removal of a zoning overlay on the property. This letter documented trip generation potential of the
site and the compliance of the proposed zoning modification with the Transportation Planning Rule
(TPR). As documented in the enclosed letter, the current proposal for site development is less than that
estimated previously. Given that no additional off-site impacts are anticipated beyond those previously
evaluated, the scope of this letter is limited to a trip generation estimate, an evaluation of the
operations at the proposed site driveways, and recommended improvements for enhanced site
circulation, access, and safety. Further details of the study methodology and findings of this analysis are
presented herein.


BACKGROUND
In 2012, KAI prepared a detailed transportation analysis for the proposed commercial site. The location
of the site is illustrated in Figure 1. The purpose of the 2012 analysis was to support a proposal for the
removal of an overlay zone that limited the site to auto-oriented sales and related uses1.



1
    At the time of the proposed 2012 zone modification, Woodburn staff noted that the site was located within the
Woodburn Interchange Area Management Plan (IAMP) study area. With the proposed removal of the auto-oriented
overlay zone, it was recognized that there was a potential for increased automobile trips to/from the site which were
not specifically studied as part of the underlying IAMP. As such, a detailed Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) analysis
was required to demonstrate that the planned and funded improvement project for the I-5/OR 214 interchange and
supporting local roadway network could accommodate the additional traffic generating potential associated with the
removal of the overlay zone without requiring additional improvements. The TPR study subsequently concluded that
the additional trip-generation potential of the site could be accommodated by the planned interchange and local
circulation improvement project. A copy of the previous TPR analysis is provided in Attachment A.

Following the formal land use review process, the City of Woodburn officially approved and removed
the auto-oriented overlay designation from the site, maintaining the General Commercial (GC) site
zoning with no overlay.


TRANSPORTATION ASSESSMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL
Since the formal removal of the auto-oriented overlay zone in 2012, the site has remained vacant. A
redevelopment proposal led by Master Capital Management is being proposed for the site that includes
a combination of commercial retail uses and restaurants. To support the development review
application, KAI has prepared the following transportation assessment for the site. This assessment
includes a detailed trip generation analysis for the purposes of documenting that the new development
proposal is consistent in scale to the assumed land uses included in the 2012 TPR analysis associated
with the removal of the overlay. This assessment is appropriate given the consistency with our 2012
analysis, and in recognition that the on-going construction of the I-5/OR 214 interchange improvement
project has likely impacted current interim traffic patterns in the larger interchange influence area. The
temporary construction disruptions limit the ability to reassess current existing traffic conditions
associated with the proposed development.


Development Proposal
Master Capital Management is proposing to redevelop the site into a commercial retail center. The
proposal includes a 6,400 square foot high-turnover sit-down restaurant, a 3,150 square foot coffee
shop with drive-through window, and 42,767 square feet of miscellaneous retail commercial space2.
Two full-movement driveways are proposed to serve the site; one driveway is located off of N. Arney
Road and one driveway is located off of Robin Avenue. The proposed site plan is shown in Figure 2.

    The square footages identified in this development proposal are preliminary and conservatively high. Based on
discussions with the design team, further architectural refinements will likely result in slightly lower overall square
footages.

Trip Generation
A trip generation analysis was prepared comparing the proposed commercial retail center to the
previous land use scenarios studied in the 2012 TPR analysis. Table 1 summarizes the assumed “worst-
case” land use and associated trip generation profile documented in the 2012 TPR analysis. As shown in
the table, the assumed mix of maximum allowed retail uses under the GC zone was estimated to
generate approximately 3,760 net new daily trips and 350 net new trips during the weekday p.m. peak
hour (175 trips in, 175 trips out).

For comparison to the 2012 study, trip generation estimates for the proposed commercial retail center
were prepared using Trip Generation, 9th Edition (Reference 1). Table 2 summarizes the daily and
weekday p.m. peak-hour trips for the proposed development. As shown in the table, the proposed mix
of restaurants and retail space is estimated to generate approximately 15 fewer net new trips during
the weekday p.m. peak hour when compared to the 2012 study.

With an estimated trip generation profile that is consistent with and approximately equal to the 2012
TPR analysis during the critical weekday pm peak hour, it can reasonably be concluded that the findings
of the 2012 TPR analysis remain applicable.


SITE ACCESS ANALYSIS
As shown in Figure 2, access to the site is proposed via two full-movement driveways. The following
sections discuss the design and anticipated operational characteristics of each as well as
recommendations to enhance site circulation, access, and safety.


Arney Road Site Driveway
The existing site currently has an access driveway located along the Arney Road site frontage. As a
result of the recent roadway improvements made along Highway 219 to the south3, this driveway is
now located only 130 feet to the north of the Highway 219/Arney Road intersection. In recognition of
this short distance and the number of northbound left-turn vehicles that are anticipated to use this
driveway for site ingress purposes, the existing site driveway is proposed to be closed and a new site
driveway constructed further to the north. This new site driveway would be located approximately 230
feet north of the Highway 219/Arney Road intersection.

To accommodate the anticipated demand at the proposed driveway, the following striping
modifications are proposed along the existing Arney Road cross section:

                Provide a northbound left-turn lane with 75 feet of storage and appropriate tapers at the
                 proposed site driveway to accommodate site ingress movements.
                Include additional roadway striping (that is complimentary to the planned raised
                 channelization island) to guide the westbound right-turn vehicles on Highway 219 into the
                 northbound through lane on Arney Road and provide a transition for the left-turn pocket at
                 the proposed site driveway.
                Maintain dual double yellow lane striping on Arney Road to delineate northbound and
                 southbound movements and discourage left-turn movements at the existing driveway
                 located on the east side of Arney Road.4


3
    As part of the I-5/OR 214 interchange modification project, Highway 219 has been widened to provide two eastbound
and two westbound travel lanes that are separated by a raised median. In addition, a westbound right-turn lane has
been constructed at the Highway 219/Arney Road intersection to better facilitate inbound vehicle trips to the
commercial and retail uses located northeast of the site.

4
    The existing Arney Road segment has dual double yellow striping from the Highway 219/Arney Road intersection to
just north of the existing site driveway.

October 6, 2014                                                                                                  Page: 7


                Connect the proposed lane striping to the existing separate northbound left- and right-turn
                 lanes at the Arney Road/Robin Avenue intersection.
                Modify the existing Stop signs (with their secondary signs) on the northbound and
                 eastbound approaches at the Arney Road/Robin Avenue intersection. These new stop signs
                 should meet the MUTCD standards that require 7 feet of clearance beneath the secondary
                 signs. The existing Stop signs do not meet this requirement as the secondary signs have less
                 than 7 feet of clearance.
A conceptual illustration of these proposed striping changes is provided in Figure 3. These striping
modifications are consistent with the on-going I-5/OR 214 interchange modification project and the
remaining modifications identified for Arney Road.

To assess the adequacy of the proposed northbound left-turn lane at the Arney Road site driveway, a
vehicle queuing analysis was performed during the weekday p.m. peak period based on existing
roadway traffic volumes (provided in Attachment B) and the projected number of northbound left-turn
maneuvers. As shown in Table 3, the estimated 95th percentile queue for the northbound left-turn
movement is projected to be minimal during the weekday pm peak hour, and can be accommodated
within the proposed storage area. The queuing analysis worksheets are provided in Attachment C.

Sight Distance
Based on the location of the proposed site driveway, the horizontal and vertical geometry of Arney
Road is such that adequate departure sight triangles can be achieved for vehicles exiting the site onto
Arney Road. To ensure that the maximum intersection sight distance is maintained at this driveway, it is
recommended that all street trees and above ground utilities be kept clear of the departure sight
triangles and that any landscaping be limited to low-lying groundcover.

Robin Avenue Site Driveway
In addition to the proposed Arney Road site driveway, a full-movement driveway is being proposed
along the Robin Avenue site frontage. This driveway would be located approximately 250 feet east of
the Woodland Avenue/Robin Avenue intersection and 150 feet west of the Arney Road/Robin Avenue
intersection.

Today, Robin Avenue accommodates a significant amount of westbound traffic generated by the
Woodburn Company Stores complex and other adjacent retail uses. During periods of a typical
weekday and for longer periods of time on the weekends, traffic volumes can queue back along Robin
Avenue from the downstream Robin Avenue/Woodland Avenue intersection. To assess the impacts of
this queuing condition on the proposed site driveway, traffic counts and queuing data were collected
during the heaviest traveled weekend time period. As a result of this effort, the following conditions
were observed:

                Vehicle queues do not consistently build up and block the proposed driveway location
                 before 2:00 or after 6 p.m. on a typical weekend day. When queues do form during these
                 periods, they are sporadic and tend to dissipate quickly.
                Westbound traffic volumes are highest along Robin Avenue between the 2:00 p.m. - 6:00
                 p.m. time period. This corresponds to the typical weekend peak shopping hours. During this
                 peak time period, westbound vehicle queue lengths were observed to be either near or at
                 the proposed driveway location. Over this four hour period, these conditions were observed
                 for a cumulative total of 55 minutes (e.g., approximately 25 percent of the time). During all
                 other times, the westbound vehicle queue was either short or it dissipated prior to
                 extending beyond the proposed driveway location.
                       o The duration of vehicle queues observed that built up to or beyond the proposed
                         driveway location ranged from a minimum of 2 minutes to a maximum of 13
                         minutes.
                       o The mean observed queue duration is approximately 6 minutes.
Based on these weekend observations, it is recognized that there are times when vehicle queues will
build up and block the proposed site driveway off of Robin Avenue. When these conditions occur, it is
likely that vehicles exiting the site onto Robin Avenue westbound will experience some periods of long
delay. However, the following site layout features will help mitigate this delay and provide options for
egress purposes:

                The site has a separate access onto Arney Road. When the Robin Avenue driveway is
                 blocked, the Arney Road driveway can be utilized to access Robin Avenue further to the east
                 to get behind the Robin Avenue vehicle queue.
                The Robin Avenue driveway has separate northbound left- and right-turn lanes to facilitate
                 multiple means of egress movements onto Robin Avenue. The Robin Avenue queuing

Woodburn Commercial Development                                                                     Project #:17858

                 condition is primarily limited to the westbound direction so exiting vehicles can still make a
                 right-turn to leave the site without delay.
                The Robin Avenue driveway throat depth has been maximized to better accommodate on-
                 site queue storage for exiting vehicles and help manage internal circulation. This layout will
                 provide exiting vehicles a view of the Robin Avenue queuing conditions and a means of
                 circulating on-site to other egress options.


Sight Distance
Due to the horizontal curvature of Robin Avenue along the north site frontage, it is important to ensure
that there is an adequate departure sight triangle for the northbound left- and right-turn exiting lanes.
The departure sight triangle for each movement is shown in Figure 2. To ensure the maximum amount
of intersection sight distance for these two movements, it is recommended that all street trees and
above ground utilities be kept clear of the departure sight triangles and that any landscaping be limited
to low-lying groundcover.


CONCLUSIONS
As documented herein, the trip generation of the proposed development is consistent with that
previously analyzed for the site. Further, the following recommendations can help ensure acceptable
operations at the site driveways:

                Implement the proposed striping modifications along Arney Road.
                All street trees and above ground utilities should be kept clear of the departure sight
                 triangles and any landscaping be limited to low-lying groundcover at the site access points
                 on both Arney Road and Robin Avenue.
                Implement the recommended site plan layout to ensure adequate queuing and circulation is
                 provided on-site.
We trust this letter adequately addresses the traffic impacts associated with the proposed Woodburn
Commercial Development. Please contact us if you have any questions.

RE: Transportation Planning Rule Compliance for the Proposed Auto Overlay Zone Restriction
Removal for Tax Lot 6600 – Woodburn, Oregon

Dear Jim,

Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) has prepared this letter summarizing the compliance of the proposed
removal of the auto-related land use zoning restriction on tax lot #6600 with the requirements of the
Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) analysis. Tax Lot #6600 is located in the northwest quadrant of the
Arney Road/Highway 214 intersection in Woodburn, Oregon. As discussed in this letter, the funded
improvements associated with the upcoming Highway 214/I-5 Interchange Project can support the
proposed unrestricted commercial zone within and beyond the horizon years of Woodburn
Interchange Area Management Plan (IAMP) and the Transportation System Plan (TSP). Details of the
TPR analysis and results are documented herein.


BACKGROUND
This letter report addresses the transportation issues related to the Ensign Property (Tax Lot 6600) in
Woodburn, Oregon. The subject site is approximately 5.04 acres and is located west of the I-5/Highway
214 interchange and is bordered by Woodland Avenue to the west, Robin Avenue to the north, Arney
Road to the east, and Highway 219 to the south. The site was previously occupied by a Chevrolet
vehicle dealership and has also operated as an Enterprise Rent-a-Car. Currently, the building on-site
(approximately 30,000 square feet) is not occupied. The site is located in proximity to the Woodburn
Company Stores and the associated retail uses as well as adjacent to a single family neighborhood to
the west. A site vicinity map is shown in Figure 1.

The site is currently zoned General Commercial (CG) with an overlay zone that limits the commercial
development opportunities to land uses that are primarily auto-oriented. The overlay zone limitation
and the site’s inclusion in the Woodburn Interchange Area Management Plan (IAMP) dictate the need
for the provided TPR analysis to support the removal of the overlay zone.

September 27, 2012                                                                                            Page: 3



TRANSPORTATION PLANNING RULE
The TPR institutes criteria under which the transportation impacts of a post-acknowledgement plan
amendment and zoning map amendment must be evaluated (Reference 1).

OAR 660-012-0060(1) states:

           (1) If an amendment to a functional plan, an acknowledged comprehensive plan, or a land use
           regulation (including a zoning map) would significantly affect an existing or planned
           transportation facility, then the local government must put in place measures as provided in
           section (2) of this rule, unless the amendment is allowed under section (3), (9) or (10) of this
           rule.

                 (a) Change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility
                 (exclusive of correction of map errors in an adopted plan);

                 (b) Change standards implementing a functional classification system; or

                 (c) Result in any of the effects listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this subsection based
                 on projected conditions measured at the end of the planning period identified in the
                 adopted TSP. As part of evaluating projected conditions, the amount of traffic projected to
                 be generated within the area of the amendment may be reduced if the amendment
                 includes an enforceable, ongoing requirement that would demonstrably limit traffic
                 generation, including, but not limited to, transportation demand management. This
                 reduction may diminish or completely eliminate the significant effect of the amendment.

                       (A) Types or levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the functional
                       classification of an existing or planned transportation facility;

                       (B) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility such that
                       it would not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive
                       plan; or

                       (C) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility that is
                       otherwise projected to not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or
                       comprehensive plan.

The Ensign property is within the existing Woodburn Interchange Area Management Plan (IAMP) which
has been adopted as part of the City’s Transportation System Plan (TSP). The proposed removal of the
auto-oriented overlay zone will result in the potential for increased automobile trips which were not
specifically studied as part of the underlying IAMP. Given that there is a planned and funded
improvement project for the adjacent interchange and roadway network, a TPR analysis has been
prepared to demonstrate that these improvements can accommodate the removal of the overlay zone.

WOODBURN INTERCHANGE IMPROVEMENTS
The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is planning to reconstruct the existing I-5/OR 214
interchange. This reconstruction project will generally include the following key elements:

                Reconstruct the interchange to a partial cloverleaf with loop ramps;
                Lengthen the ramps to meet current design standards;
                Widen the existing over-crossing structure (bridge) to the north;
                Raise the profile of the bridge approaches in order to improve sight lines;
                Widen Oregon 214 and 219 equally or northerly of the existing centerline
                Provide new 6-foot sidewalks with an additional 6 foot-wide landscaped buffer between
                 the sidewalk and the curb;
                Provide one bicycle lane in each direction along Oregon 214 and 219;
                Add a raised median to control turning movements;
                Modify access for local city streets at Oregon Way, Evergreen Road and Lawson Avenue;
                Construct a Transit Facility (Park & Ride) and extend Evergreen Road north of Oregon 214
                 for neighborhood access to the public transit lines listed above.
Figure 2 below graphically illustrates the extent of the interchange improvements and Figure 3 shows
the planned lane configurations and traffic control devices.

The improvement of the interchange is being funded, in part, by Oregon’s Jobs and Transportation Act
(JTA) and is scheduled for completion in 2015. For the purposes of the TPR analysis, it is appropriate to
include these improvements in the evaluation of the proposed removal of the zoning overlay on the
Ensign property.


TPR ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
The TPR requires evaluation of the forecast transportation system operations in the TSP horizon year or
a minimum of 15 years from the proposal, both with and without the proposed overlay removal. The
analysis years included in the TSP and IAMP are less than the 15-year minimum horizon year
requirement within the TPR so the analyses contained in this letter focus on 2027 forecast conditions.
A discussion of the methodology, assumptions and findings of year 2027 conditions is provided below.


TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 3) and ODOT’s Analysis and Procedures
Manual (APM).

All intersection evaluations used the peak 15-minute flow rate during the weekday p.m. peak hour.
Using the peak 15-minute flow rate ensures that this analysis is based on a reasonable worst-case
scenario. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to occur for 15 minutes out
of each average peak hour. The transportation system will likely operate under conditions better than
those described in this report during other time periods.

Per the 1999 Oregon Highway Plan (OHP) classification maps, Highway 214/219 is classified as a District
Highway and I-5 is classified as an Interstate Highway. As such, the mobility standards for each of these
facilities are summarized in Table 1 below.

FORECAST TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Forecast Methodology
Year 2027 traffic volumes were developed from the 2020 traffic volumes documented in the Woodburn
Transportation System Plan (TSP) (Reference 4). The 2020 TSP volumes were increased by an annual
percentage based on Future Volume Tables data1 for specific segments of roadways in the vicinity of
the Ensign Property along Highway 214/219. The data is summarized in Table 2 below.

Table 2           TPAU Future Volume Forecasts

                           0.1 Mile West of I-5   Annual   0.01 Mile East of I-5   Annual   0.3 Mile South of OR 219      Annual
                                                  Growth                           Growth                                 Growth
        Highway            2010         2030       Rate    2010           2030      Rate      2008          2030           Rate
    Highway 214/219
                          17,800       20,600      0.8%    24,900        26,400     0.3%        --            --             --
    (#140)
    I-5
                               --        --         --       --             --       --      78,300        109,300         1.8%
    (#001)



As shown in the table above, the average annual growth rate along Highway 219 is forecast to be
approximately 0.8 percent annually to the west of I-5 and 0.3 percent annually to the east of I-5. To
provide a conservative forecast of traffic volumes along Highway 219, the analysis herein assumes a
one percent annual growth rate from the 2020 TSP volumes to arrive at the forecast 2027 volumes.

The 2020 TSP volumes and the 2027 forecast volumes are shown in Attachment “A.”


TRIP GENERATION

Existing Zoning
Our review of the Woodburn IAMP indicates that the Ensign Property is accounted for as a
commercially zoned site with an auto-oriented land use restriction according to the provisions of the
overlay zone. For the purposes of the TPR analysis, we developed a reasonable “worst-case” trip
generation based on the existing zoning with the auto-oriented overlay restriction. The land use
assumptions used to determine the trip potential are summarized in Table 3 below. Per conversation
with city staff, the intent of the existing overlay restriction is to allow only auto sales on the property.
The overlay language in the zoning code could be interpreted more broadly to allow for the uses shown
in Table 3.

Proposed Zoning without the Overlay Restrictions
The owners of the Ensign Property would like to add flexibility for future redevelopment of the
property to enable land uses that are not allowed within the existing overlay restrictions. To support
the proposed removal of the overlay, the remainder of this report provides an analysis of the impact of
a reasonable “worst-case” development scenario for the commercial zone.

Similar to the existing zoning trip generation, a reasonable “worst-case” trip generation was estimated
for the property based on the commercial zoning without consideration of the auto-oriented overlay
restriction. The land use assumptions used to determine the trip potential are summarized in Table 4

As shown in Table 4, the commercial zoning without the auto-oriented overlay restriction would allow
for general retail, fast food and a bank. A potential site development scenario for this concept is shown
in Figure 4 for illustrative purposes. This development mix is estimated to generate approximately

3,760 daily trips and 350 trips during the weekday p.m. peak hour (290 trips in, 290 trips out). The TPR
analysis provided in the following section analyzes the impact of the added trips from existing
restricted commercial zoning (Table 3) and the proposed unrestricted commercial zoning (Table 4).


YEAR 2027 TPR ANALYSIS

Current Commercial Zoning with Auto Overlay Restriction
The reasonable “worst-case” trip generation and distribution for the existing zoning with the auto-
restricted overlay is summarized in Figure 5. The 2027 traffic operations analysis for the current auto-
overlay restricted commercial zoning is shown in Figure 6. As shown, all intersections within the IAMP
study area are forecast to operate within OHP mobility standards.

The traffic operations worksheets for the 2027 total traffic conditions with the current commercial
zoning overlay restriction are shown in Attachment “B.”


Proposed Commercial Zoning without Auto Overlay Restriction
The reasonable “worst-case” trip generation and distribution for the existing zoning with the auto-
restriction removed is summarized in Figure 9. The 2027 total traffic operations analysis for the
unrestricted commercial zoning is shown in Figure 10. As shown, all intersections within the IAMP
study area are forecast to operate acceptably. Based on this analysis, the proposed removal of the
zoning overlay is not forecast to significantly affect the transportation system, and the applicable
provisions of the TPR can be met.

The traffic operations worksheets for the 2027 total traffic conditions with the unrestricted commercial
zoning are shown in Attachment “C.”

CONCLUSIONS
Based on the analysis presented in this letter, the proposed removal of the auto-restriction overlay on
the commercial zone for tax lot #6600 in Woodburn, Oregon can be completed consistent with OAR
660-012-0060, as addressed below.

OAR 660-012-0060

(1) If an amendment to a functional plan, an acknowledged comprehensive plan, or a land use
regulation (including a zoning map) would significantly affect an existing or planned transportation
facility, then the local government must put in place measures as provided in section (2) of this rule,
unless the amendment is allowed under section (3), (9) or (10) of this rule.

Response: The transportation impacts of the proposed zoning modification are not forecast to
significantly affect the planned interchange improvements and transportation facilities.

       (a) Change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility (exclusive
           of correction of map errors in an adopted plan);
           Response: No change to the functional classification or planned transportation facility is
           proposed.

       (b) Change standards implementing a functional classification system; or
           Response: No change to the standards of the functional classification system is proposed.

       (c) Result in any of the effects listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this subsection based on
       projected conditions measured at the end of the planning period identified in the adopted TSP. As
       part of evaluating projected conditions, the amount of traffic projected to be generated within the
       area of the amendment may be reduced if the amendment includes an enforceable, ongoing
       requirement that would demonstrably limit traffic generation, including, but not limited to,
       transportation demand management. This reduction may diminish or completely eliminate the
       significant effect of the amendment.

                 (A) Types or levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the functional classification
                 of an existing or planned transportation facility;
                 Response: All types and levels of travel and access are consistent with the functional
                 classification of the planned transportation facility.

                 (B) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility such that it
                 would not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive plan; or
                 Response: The transportation impacts of the proposed zoning modification are not
                 forecast to degrade the performance of the planned transportation facility such that it
                 would not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive plan.

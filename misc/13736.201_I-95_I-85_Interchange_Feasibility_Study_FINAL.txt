EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Virginia Department of Transportation Central Region Operations (VDOT-CRO) had Kittelson &
Associates, Inc. (KAI) conduct a feasibility analysis of three potential safety and operational projects at
the I-95/I-85 interchange in Petersburg, Virginia. The analysis considered and built upon information
from a 2013 study of the I-95 corridor.

The work efforts generally included evaluating historical crash data, reviewing and assessing previous
conceptual projects (developed by others), and developing new concepts and/or refining prior
concepts. Concept revisions and refinements incorporated contemporary planning, operations, design,
and safety performance considerations while considering three dimensional roadway design principles.
Order of magnitude cost opinions were also developed.

BACKGROUND
          Interstates 95 and 85, as well as Route 460 and US 301 (S. Crater Road), converge in Petersburg,
           Virginia in a complex series of interchanges developed in the mid-1950’s as part of the
           Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike. These interchanges reflect their vintage and do not necessarily
           reflect contemporary freeway and interchange planning, operations, design, and safety
           performance considerations.
          The designs exhibit short acceleration/deceleration lanes, relatively small radius turns, and
           relatively short weave/merge areas.
          The I-95/I-85 Interchange Roadway Safety Assessment Report published by Kimley-Horn &
           Associates, Inc. (KHA) in March 2013 was intended to be the first phase of an eventual larger
           I-95/I-85/Route 460 Interchange Area operations and conceptual design study that would
           update comprehensive planning study was conducted in the study same area between 1998
           and 2000 and identified a number of “capacity and safety issues” [sic].
          Issue #1: I-85 Northbound Off-Ramp to I-95 Southbound Weaving Section: The configuration of
           the I-85 northbound off-ramp to I-95 southbound movement results in periodic
           congestion/queuing leading into and through this section. The configuration includes a 250-foot
           weaving segment (between the I-85 northbound off-ramp merge with the I-95 southbound
           collector-distributor road and the Graham Road off-ramp) with an approximately 7% average
           uphill grade of the I-85 northbound off-ramp itself.
               o KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #1) that included the following
                    changes/modifications:
                                  Close the existing I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road;
                                  Close the existing I-95 southbound on-ramp from S. Crater Road;
                                  Reconstruct the Graham Road and S. Crater Road intersection and the on-ramp
                                   to southbound I-95 to allow southbound left-turn movement from S. Crater
                                   Road; and,
                                  Construct new I-95 off-ramp to S. Crater Road.

I-95/I-85 Interchange Feasibility Study                                                             Executive Summary


          Issue #2: S. Crater Road to I-95 Northbound Weaving Section: An approximately 360-foot
           weaving section exists between the S. Crater Road on-ramp to I-95 northbound movement and
           the off-ramp to the E. Wythe Street/E. Washington Street couplet in downtown Petersburg.
               o KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #2) to address this issue that included the
                   following changes/modifications:
                                  Close the existing I-95 northbound on-ramp from S. Crater Road and reuse the
                                   existing Winfield Road to relocate the northbound I-95 on-ramp connection to
                                   County Drive (Route 460 Bus.).
                                  Reconstruct two intersections to facilitate new traffic movements:
                                        Winfield Road/County Drive (Route 460 Bus.)
                                        Winfield Road/Crater Road
          Issue #3: I-95 Northbound Off-Ramp to I-85 Southbound Ramp Radius and Bridge Clearance:
           The existing I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound ramp has a 200 foot radius curve and the
           current bridge clearance for the ramp beneath I-95 is 13 feet 10 inches; it does not meet
           current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) minimum clearance requirements for
           interstates (16 feet).
               o KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #3) to address this issue that included the
                   following changes/modifications:
                                  Close the existing I-95 northbound off-ramp to I-85 southbound and construct a
                                   new flyover ramp (left-hand exit) from I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound.

INITIAL CONCEPT EVALUATION
          KAI reviewed each long-term Concept to consider its feasibility. Criteria considered included:
               o Potential upstream and downstream impacts
               o Intersection/turn lane improvements
               o Design year peak hour operational performance (intersections)
                        LOS D or better
               o Application of contemporary planning, operations, design, and safety performance
                   features
               o Environmental, right-of-way, and utility impacts
               o Constructability
               o Estimated Cost
          KAI identified issues/questions that could not be immediately determined without further
           investigation, analysis, and/or refinement.

CONCEPT REVISIONS
          KAI revised each original concept to reflect contemporary planning, operations, design, and
           safety performance considerations. The revisions consider three dimensional roadway design
           principles.

          An iterative process of refining the concepts included:
               o Developing forecast design year 2040 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes
               o Reassigning forecast traffic to the transportation network based for each Concept
                   considered
               o Identifying necessary intersection-level details such as appropriate intersection control
                   and sizing of turn lanes
               o Confirming geometric design details (turn lanes/storages, horizontal and vertical
                   alignment, etc.)
               o Retaining current network connectivity to ensure no Concept would eliminate
                   connections that exist today
          KAI developed two additional evaluated the compatibility of individual concepts and potential
           for phasing improvements.
          Each revised Concept carried forward was ultimately refined and illustrated by KAI as a single-
           line taping. The tapings depict concepts reflecting contemporary planning, operations, design,
           and safety performance considerations, as well as three dimensional roadway design principles.
          Each configuration developed through this process helps clarify each Concept’s impact, cost,
           and feasibility with respect to the criteria discussed previously.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS
          VDOT staff selected a design year of 2040 to assess the potential design life of the concepts.
          Compounded annual growth (provided by VDOT) was adjusted to address identified imbalances
           (caused by different growth rates) that occurred between closely-spaced intersections.
          KAI performed an operational analysis for each refined Concept as well as a no-build condition.
          Each refined concept is forecast to meet VDOT performance criteria in the design year.

COST ESTIMATES
          Base mapping was developed to serve as a basis for developing the estimates. Data sources
           investigated to inform the mapping include:
               o VDOT record drawings
               o City of Petersburg GIS shape file data
               o US Fish and Wildlife’s National Wetland Inventory (NWI) mapping
               o US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conversation Service Web Soil Survey
               o Virginia Game and Inland Fisheries (VaFWIS) database
               o Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Natural Heritage Program
                   database
               o Virginia Department of Historic Resource’s (VDHR) Virginia Cultural Resources
                   Information System (V-CRIS)
               o Environmental Data Resources, Inc. with GeoCheck
          When possible, Concepts were broken out into smaller “Projects” when stand-alone
           improvements/modifications could be isolated. The ability to isolate Projects was governed by a
           desire to retain all existing movements/connections, thereby avoiding a long-term loss of

          Refined Concept #1: This Concept has been broken out into three separate projects (A, B, and
           C).
               o Project A would eliminate the loop ramp to I-95 southbound from S. Crater Road, realign
                   Graham Road and the I-95 on-ramp to intersect, and create separate north- and
                   southbound left-turn lanes on S. Crater Road.
                         Project A Cost: $3.3M
               o Project B would eliminate the I-95 southbound C-D road off-ramp to Graham Road and
                   construct a new off-ramp to S. Crater Road from the Route 460 Bus./I-95 southbound
                   split.
                         Project B Cost: 8.1M
               o Project C would use the area in the vacated loop ramp as a potential future location for
                   a park and ride lot. Assuming Graham Road is realigned, there would be enough area to
                   provide roughly 150 parking spaces.
                         Project C Cost: $750,000
               o Total Refined Concept #1 Cost: $12.15M
          Refined Concept #2: This Concept has been broken out into two separate projects (A and B).
               o Project A includes intersection improvements on S. Crater Road north of I-95, Winfield
                   Road corridor improvements, and modifications to the Winfield Road/Route 460 Bus.
                   intersection as well as the I-95 northbound on-ramp and C-D road.
                         Project A Cost: $11.6M
               o Project B includes improvements to the I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road,
                   Graham Road widening, and modifications to the Graham Road/S. Crater Road
                   intersection.
                         Project B Cost: $3.8M
                         Note: Project B does not directly address the identified weaving issue on the I-95
                           NB C-D road. Rather, Project B includes improvements that address operational/
                           capacity issues identified in the no-build analysis on the south side of I-95 at the
                           Graham Road/ I-95 Off-Ramp and Graham Road/S. Crater Road intersections. It
                           should be noted that this particular project would largely conflict with Project A
                           from Refined Concept #1, or if implemented prior to Project A from Refined
                           Concept #1 require significant reconstruction and additional cost.
               o Total Refined Concept #2 Cost: $15.4M
          Refined Concept #3: This Concept would provide a flyover ramp to serve I-95 northbound to
           I-85 southbound movements and is designed with a right-hand exit configuration.
               o Total Refined Concept #3 Cost: $92.4M
          Refined Concept #1 & #2 Combined: This Concept would combine Refined Concepts #1 and #2,
           but also provides a new two-way extension of Route 460 Bus. from I-95 to S. Crater Road. This
           Concept has been broken out into four separate projects (A, B, C, and D).
               o Project A is similar to Project A of Refined Concept #1 discussed earlier.
                         Project A Cost: $3.3M

               o Project B is similar to Project A of Refined Concept #2 except that it does not include
                  improvements (widening) to Winfield Road to the same extent or to the County Road
                  corridor.
                       Project B Cost: $11.6M
               o Project C includes the elimination of the I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road
                  (similar to Project B of Refined Concept #1), but creates a new intersection with the
                  extension of Route 460 Bus. as opposed to a free-flow off-ramp connection to S. Crater
                  Road.
                       Project C Cost: $18.5M
               o Project D would use the area in the vacated loop ramp as a potential future location for
                  a park and ride lot. Assuming Graham Road is realigned, there would be enough area to
                  provide roughly 150 parking spaces.

I-95/I-85 Interchange Feasibility Study                                                           Introduction




INTRODUCTION
The Virginia Department of Transportation Central Region Operations (VDOT-CRO) had Kittelson &
Associates, Inc. (KAI) conduct a feasibility analysis of three potential safety and operational projects at
the I-95/I-85 interchange in Petersburg, Virginia. The analysis considered and built upon information
from a 2013 study of the I-95 corridor.

The work efforts generally included evaluating historical crash data, reviewing and assessing previous
conceptual projects (developed by others), and developing new concepts and/or refining prior
concepts. Concept revisions and refinements incorporated contemporary planning, operations, design,
and safety performance considerations while considering three dimensional roadway design principles.
Order of magnitude cost opinions were also developed.

The following key objectives guided the project team and VDOT in identifying and refining potential
projects at the I-95/I-85 interchange and adjacent intersections/interchanges:

                Considering long-term feasibility of identified projects through year of 2040
                Address documented existing interchange/intersection operations and safety performance
                Minimize potential right-of-way, environmental, and utility impacts
Study Area
The study area is primarily focused on the I-95/I-85 interchange itself, though the close proximity of
adjacent interchanges necessitates considering the interchanges and the adjoining local street network.
Figure 1 illustrates the study limits.

I-95/I-85 Interchange Feasibility Study                                        Background & Contextual Evaluation


BACKGROUND & CONTEXTUAL EVALUATION
Evaluating existing conditions helps to better understand current operational and geometric
characteristics of the I-95/I-85 interchange and surrounding roadways within the study area. Reviewing
previous studies provides a base from which to begin in assessing possible solutions either by refining
prior ideas or considering additional concepts.

To better understand prevailing conditions in the study area, Kittelson and Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff
reviewed of previous studies and collected additional traffic data (beyond that originally available and
provided by VDOT) to document current issues, conditions, and previously identified concepts. KAI
considered the following information from VDOT to evaluate the study area:

           Intersection turning movement counts
           Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts
           Intersection and roadway geometry
           Traffic observations during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours
           Reported crash history from 2008 through 2013
           Aerial imagery

KAI staff visited the study area in July 2014 to collect information regarding field conditions, adjacent
land uses, and existing traffic operations.

BACKGROUND
Interstates 95 and 85, as well as Route 460 and US 301 (S. Crater Road), converge in Petersburg, Virginia
in a complex series of interchanges developed in the mid-1950’s as part of the Richmond-Petersburg
Turnpike. These interchanges reflect their vintage and do not necessarily reflect contemporary freeway
and interchange planning, operations, design, and safety performance considerations. The designs
exhibit short acceleration/deceleration lanes, relatively small radius turns, and relatively short
weave/merge areas.

The I-95/I-85 Interchange Roadway Safety Assessment Report published by Kimley-Horn & Associates,
Inc. (KHA) in March 2013 was intended to be the first phase of an eventual larger I-95/I-85/Route 460
Interchange Area operations and conceptual design study. That future study would update a previous
planning study conducted in the study same area between 1998 and 2000 that identified a number of
capacity and safety issues. The 2013 KHA report highlights three “safety issues” within the I-95/I-85
interchange area (originally identified in the 2000 study) and presents three long-term “Concepts” to
address them.

The following sections summarize key elements of the three concepts and the “issue” than led to their
development.

Issue #1: I-85 Northbound Off-Ramp to I-95 Southbound Weaving Section
The configuration of the I-85 northbound off-ramp to I-95 southbound movement results in periodic
congestion/queuing leading into and through this section. The configuration includes a 250-foot
weaving segment (between the I-85 northbound off-ramp merge with the I-95 southbound collector-
distributor road and the Graham Road off-ramp) with an approximately 7% average uphill grade of the
I-85 northbound off-ramp itself.
Concept #1
KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #1) that included the following changes/modifications:

          Close the existing I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road;
          Close the existing I-95 southbound on-ramp from S. Crater Road;
          Reconstruct the Graham Road and S. Crater Road intersection and the on-ramp to southbound
           I-95 to allow southbound left-turn movement from S. Crater Road; and,
          Construct new I-95 off-ramp to S. Crater Road. [Preliminary engineering (30% plans)
           recommended to determine environmental feasibility.]

Issue #2: S. Crater Road to I-95 Northbound Weaving Section
An approximately 360-foot weaving section exists between the S. Crater Road on-ramp to I-95
northbound movement and the off-ramp to the E. Wythe Street/E. Washington Street couplet in
downtown Petersburg.

Concept #2
KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #2) to address this issue that included the following
changes/modifications:

          Close the existing I-95 northbound on-ramp from S. Crater Road and reuse the existing Winfield
           Road to relocate the northbound I-95 on-ramp connection to County Drive (Route 460 Bus.).
          Reconstruct two intersections to facilitate new traffic movements:
               o Winfield Road/County Drive (Route 460 Bus.)
               o Winfield Road/Crater Road

Issue #3: I-95 Northbound Off-Ramp to I-85 Southbound Ramp Radius and Bridge Clearance
The existing I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound ramp has a 200 foot radius curve and the current
bridge clearance for the ramp beneath I-95 is 13 feet 10 inches; it does not meet current Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) minimum clearance requirements for interstates (16 feet).

Concept #3
KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #3) to address this issue that included the following
changes/modifications:

          Close the existing I-95 northbound off-ramp to I-85 southbound and construct a new flyover
           ramp (left-hand exit) from I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound.

DATA AVAILABILITY AND RESOLUTION
VDOT initially supplied the project team with data to support a feasibility assessment of each KHA
concept. This included:

          Average Daily Traffic volumes (by link)
          Crash data from 2008 to 2013
          VGIN Digital Orthophotography
          Documented right-of-way, utilities, and/or environmental resources in the study area
          Annual traffic growth rates for roadways in the site vicinity
KAI supplemented these data with plat record research (Timmons Group) and supplemental
intersection turning movement counts (KAI) at key intersections during the weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hours. Appendix A contains the intersection turning movement count data.

The crash data does not contain enough detail/resolution to accurately isolate crash locations and
correlate crashes to specific locations in the study area. KAI could locate an individual crash by mile
point on I-95 southbound, for example, but there was no way to determine if the crash occurred on I-95
main line or on the adjacent collector-distributor road. As such, a detailed safety analysis of reported
crashes and descriptive statistics was not possible.

INITIAL CONCEPT EVALUATION
KAI reviewed each long-term concept to consider its feasibility. Criteria considered included:

          Potential upstream and downstream impacts
          Intersection/turn lane improvements
          Design year peak hour operational performance (intersections)
               o LOS D or better
          Application of contemporary planning, operations, design, and safety performance features
          Environmental, right-of-way, and utility impacts
          Constructability
          Estimated Cost
The following section summarizes identified issues/questions for each original Concept that could not
be immediately determined without further investigation, analysis, and/or refinement.

Concept #1
Implementing this concept would eliminate the approximately 250-foot weaving section between the
I-85 northbound off-ramp merge with the I-95 southbound collector-distributor road and the Graham
Road off-ramp. It would shift traffic demand from the existing Graham Road off-ramp to a new off-
ramp that would ultimately connect to S. Crater Road approximately one-half mile south of the current
Graham Road/S. Crater Road intersection. While this Concept addresses the short weaving section
identified between ramps, the concept requires further investigation, analysis, and/or refinement to
determine feasibility, including:

          The extent of intersection construction to the Graham Road/S. Crater Road intersection to
           appropriately accommodate a southbound left-turn movement from S. Crater Road to I-95
           Southbound
          The magnitude of intersection construction for the new intersection created at the I-95 off-
           ramp/S. Crater Road intersection
          The operational performance of new intersection configurations and effect of rerouted traffic
           demand
          The feasibility of designing and placing overhead guide signs to account for a third option at the
           downstream I-95 Southbound/Route 460 Bus./S. Crater Road off-ramp diverge point
          Quantifying out-of-direction travel introduced by new off-ramp alignment to S. Crater Road
          The risk of wrong-way movements at an isolated on-way off-ramp that violates driver
           expectancy
          Potential environmental, right-of-way, and utility impacts of improvements
          Updating cost estimates
Concept #2
Implementing this concept would eliminate the approximately 360 foot weaving section between the S.
Crater Road on-ramp to I-95 northbound movement and the off-ramp to the E. Wythe Street/E.
Washington Street couplet in downtown Petersburg. While this Concept addresses the short weaving
section, the concept requires additional investigation/analysis, including:

          The extent of intersection construction to the Winfield Road/S. Crater Road intersection to
           appropriately accommodate new turning movements to/from S. Crater Road and two-way
           operation of Winfield Road
          The extent of intersection construction to the Winfield Road/Route 460 Bus. Intersection to
           appropriately accommodate additional I-95 northbound demand displaced by on-ramp closure.
          The extent of intersection construction to the I-95 northbound C-D road off-ramp to S. Crater
           Road and a two-way Winfield Road
          Quantifying out-of-direction travel on Winfield Road for new access to I-95 northbound/I-85
           southbound from S. Crater Road
          Determining operational performance of new intersection configurations and effects of
           rerouted traffic demand
          Quantifying the impact of increased demand on the I-95 northbound C-D road between the
           existing on-ramp from Route 460 Bus. and the off-ramp to S. Crater Road

Concept #3
Implementing this concept would eliminate the existing I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound ramp with
a 200 foot tight radius and address the vertical clearance issue noted previously. While this Concept
addresses these issues, additional concerns require further investigation/analysis, including:

          Assessing impacts of removing ramp access from the I-95/S. Crater Road interchange to I-85
           southbound.
          Exploring the ramification of a left and exit. Left-hand exits are inconsistent with American
           Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) policy, violate driver
           expectancy, and would likely necessitate a shift to the I-95 main line northbound roadway
           alignment.
          Assessing the extent of flyover ramp vertical alignment and construction limits south of Graham
           Road where the ramp would connect to I-85 southbound.
          Updating cost estimates

All three Concepts could be advanced by VDOT (assuming provision of certain modifications discussed
later in this report) for further assessments. In addition to several refinements, KAI also developed two
additional concepts that illustrate their combination in an integrated manner.

SINGLE-LINE TAPINGS
Each Concept carried forward was ultimately refined and illustrated by KAI as a single-line taping. The
taping depicts concepts reflecting contemporary planning, operations, design, and safety performance
considerations. The concepts consider three dimensional roadway design principles. An iterative
process of refining the concepts included:

          Developing forecast design year 2040 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes
          Reassigning forecast traffic to the transportation network based for each Concept considered
          Identifying necessary intersection-level details such as appropriate intersection control and
           sizing of turn lanes
          Confirming geometric design details (turn lanes/storages, horizontal and vertical alignment,
           etc.)
          Retaining current network connectivity to ensure no Concept would eliminate connections that
           exist today

Each configuration developed through this process helps clarify each Concept’s impact, cost, and
feasibility with respect to the criteria discussed previously. These tapings are illustrated in subsequent
figures summarizing identified intersection controls, lane configurations, and detailed design year
traffic operational results at affected intersections on the network.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CONCEPTS
KAI performed an operational analysis for each Concept carried forward. VDOT staff selected a design
year of 2040 to assess the potential design life of the concepts. A 2040 No-Build analysis serves as a
base condition to assess how the study area’s roadway network would operate at the future planning
horizon assuming no future improvements were implemented.

FUTURE TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND BACKGROUND GROWTH
KAI developed design year 2040 traffic volumes using annual growth rates provided by VDOT that are
summarized below.

          I-95 SB & I-85 NB to I-95 SB Collector Distributor Road – 1.1%
          I-95 SB Off-Ramp to Graham Road – 0.5%
          I-95 NB Off-Ramp & Route 460 WB – 0.5%
          I-95 Ramps and Route 460 BUS. – 1.2%
          Route 460 WB Main line – 0.8%
          SB Crater Road to I-95 SB – 1.3%
          S. Crater Road – 0.5%
          Graham Road – 1.25%
          I-95 Main line – 1.4%
          I-85 Main line – 1.4%
Compounded annual growth was adjusted to address identified imbalances (caused by different growth
rates) that occurred between closely-spaced intersections.

YEAR 2040 NO-BUILD OPERATIONS ANALYSIS
Figure 5 illustrates year 2040 no-build lane configurations and traffic control devices (assuming no
modifications are made) at key study intersections. Figure 6 and Figure 7 summarize the No-Build
operational results during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively.

Under year 2040 No-Build conditions, the analysis shows the following intersections would operate at
LOS F and/or over capacity for the identified time periods:

                I-95 Off-Ramp/Graham Road – Critical SB Approach
                     ● Weekday p.m. peak hour v/c = 1.36,
                     ● LOS F
                     ● 95th percentile queue on off-ramp: 771 feet
                I-95 On-Ramp/S. Crater Road/Commercial Entrance – Critical WB Approach
                     ● LOS F (Weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours)

I-95/I-85 Interchange Feasibility Study                                       Operational Analysis of Concepts


I-95 Off-Ramp/Graham Road – Critical SB Approach
The critical southbound approach at the I-95 Off-Ramp/Graham Road intersection is forecast to operate
over capacity during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Estimated queues extend onto the C-D road. This
condition would further exacerbate the congestion and friction within the weaving section between the
I-85/I-95 off-ramp merge and Graham Road/C-D Road diverge.

I-95 On-Ramp/S. Crater Road/Commercial Entrance – Critical WB Approach
The critical westbound approach of the I-95 On-Ramp/S. Crater Road/Commercial Entrance intersection
is forecast to operate at LOS F during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. While the critical
approach is forecast to continue to operate below capacity, excessive delay for this approach could
adversely impact the operation of the intersection.

REFINED CONCEPT #1
Key modifications, improvements, and assumptions identified for Refined Concept #1 are summarized
below. (Intersection numbers refer to the numbered intersections in the figures for clarity)

General Elements
          Close the existing I-95 Southbound C-D road off-ramp to Graham Road
          Close the existing on-ramp to I-95 Southbound/Route 460 Bus. from S. Crater Road
          Construct a new off-ramp to S. Crater Road
               o Widen I-95 Southbound C-D Road to accommodate new exit
               o Re-design placement/design of overhead guide signs to account for a third option at the
                   downstream I-95 Southbound/Route 460 Bus./S. Crater Road off-ramp at diverge point
          Remove the yield condition on I-85 northbound to I-95 southbound C-D Road. A two-lane C-D
           road can accept single-lane ramps from I-95 southbound and I-85 northbound in a free-flow
           condition.
Intersection-Specific Elements
          Intersection #1 (Graham Road/S. Crater Road/I-95 Southbound On-Ramp)
               o Realign Graham Road and on-ramp to intersect
               o Shift southbound lanes on S. Crater Road through intersection to develop a separate
                   southbound left-turn lane to the I-95 Southbound on-ramp
               o Develop a separate northbound left-turn lane on S. Crater Road to Graham Road
               o Proposed traffic signal operation
                        85 second cycle
                        Protected/permissive NB/SB left turns
          Intersection #2 (New I-95 Southbound Off-Ramp/S. Crater Road)
               o Install new traffic signal
               o Develop dual westbound left-turn lanes and a single right-turn lane on off-ramp
               o Proposed traffic signal operation
                        100 second cycle
                        Two phase signal operation

Refined Concept #1 Findings
The following describes how the refined concept addresses the identified outstanding issues/concerns
requiring additional investigation, analysis, and/or refinement. “Answers” to “questions” are
summarized below in italics.

          The extent of construction at the Graham Road/S. Crater Road intersection to appropriately
           accommodate a southbound left-turn movement from S. Crater Road to I-95 Southbound
               o See previous description of Intersection #1
          The extent of construction at the I-95 off-ramp/S. Crater Road intersection
               o See previous description of Intersection #2
          Determining operational performance of new intersection configurations and effect of rerouted
           traffic demand
               o Operational analysis demonstrates acceptable intersection performance at affected
                    intersections.
          The feasibility of designing and placing overhead guide signs to account for a third option at the
           downstream I-95 Southbound/Route 460 Bus./S. Crater Road off-ramp diverge point
               o Eliminating the weaving section and developing an additional lane on C-D road in
                    advance of the three-way split would include overhead lane signs to direct travelers to
                    the desired lane.
          Determining the effects of out-of-direction travel introduced by new off-ramp alignment to S.
           Crater Road
               o Limited impact since demand is oriented south of the new off-ramp intersection with S.
                    Crater Road.
          The risk for wrong-way movements from introducing an isolated on-way off-ramp that violates
           driver expectancy
               o Potential remains, but risks can be mitigated by providing signage in accordance with
                    2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and VDOT Supplement.
          Potential project environmental, right-of-way, and utility impacts
               o New off-ramp avoids Poor Creek pumping station and sanitary force mains
          Updating cost estimates
               o See subsequent section for details regarding costs
Park and Ride Lot
VDOT identified the area in the vacated loop ramp as a potential future location for a park and ride lot.
Assuming Graham Road is realigned, there would be enough area to provide roughly 150 parking
spaces, with an estimated cost of approximately $750,000.

Key modifications, improvements, and assumptions identified for Concept #2 are summarized below.
(Intersection numbers refer to the numbered intersections in the figures for clarity)

General Elements
          Develop a second eastbound lane on Graham Road between the Off-Ramp and S. Crater Road
          Reconstruct the I-95 Northbound on-ramp merge from Winfield Road/Route 460 Bus. to
           provide adequate merge and decision distance requirements
Intersection-Specific Elements

Refined Concept #2 Findings
The following describes how the refined concept addresses the identified outstanding issues/concerns
requiring additional investigation, analysis, and/or refinement. “Answers” to “questions” are
summarized below in italics.

          The extent of construction at the Winfield Road/S. Crater Road intersection to appropriately
           accommodate new turning movements to/from S. Crater Road and two-way operation of
           Winfield Road.
               o See previous description of improvements at Intersection #2
          The extent of construction at to the Winfield Road/Route 460 Bus. Intersection to appropriately
           accommodate additional I-95 northbound demand displaced by on-ramp closure.
               o See previous description of improvements at Intersections #5 and #6
          The extent of construction at the I-95 northbound C-D road off-ramp to S. Crater Road and a
           two-way Winfield Road
               o See previous description of improvements at Intersection #1
          Determining the effects of out-of-direction travel introduced by the elimination of the I-95
           northbound on-ramp from S. Crater Road via a new connection from Winfield
               o Introduces approximately one total mile of out-of-direction travel for drivers traveling
                    from S. Crater Road to I-95 northbound/I-85 southbound/E. Wythe Street.
          Determining operational performance of new intersection configurations and effect of rerouted
           traffic demand
               o Operational analysis demonstrates acceptable intersection performance at affected
                    intersections.
          Determining the impact of increased demand on the I-95 northbound C-D road between the
           existing on-ramp from Route 460 Bus. and the off-ramp to S. Crater Road
               o Elimination of the I-95 northbound off-ramp to S. Crater Road northbound increases the
                    overall weaving distance between on- and off-ramps on C-D road.
          Potential project environmental, right-of-way, and utility impacts
               o Winfield Road should not be widened to the north to avoid impacting existing cultural
                    resources.
               o Increased traffic volumes on Winfield Road require further investigation of access
                    management policies and should include outreach to affected business and property
                    owners along this corridor.
               o Realigning the Graham Road off ramp with Rosewood Terrace (the existing offset
                    subdivision road across from the Graham Road off ramp) or vice versa will require some
                    right of way.
               o Widening along Graham Road is assumed to be towards the Limited Access Right of Way
                    in lieu of towards the outside to reduce right of way impacts. Impacts to properties along
                    S. Crater Road south of Graham Road are anticipated.

Refined Concept #3 Findings
The following describes how the refined concept addresses the identified outstanding issues/concerns
requiring additional investigation, analysis, and/or refinement. “Answers” to “questions” are
summarized below in italics.

          Removing the ramp access from the I-95/S. Crater Road interchange to I-85 southbound
               o The existing 200 foot radius loop ramp from I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound is
                   retained to facilitate this movement.
               o This concept does not address existing bridge clearance issue.
          Inconsistency of left-hand exit design
               o Flyover ramp has been redesigned to a right-hand exit to better meet driver expectation
                   and contemporary geometric design principles.

               o A right-hand exit design increases impacts to property owners in the Bellevue Avenue
                   corridor relative to the original left-hand exit design. However, the right-hand exit design
                   incorporates contemporary geometric design principles, better meets driver
                   expectations, and avoids costly reconstruction of the I-95 main line.

COMBINED CONCEPT
KAI developed a single-line taping that combines “Refined Concepts #1 & #2 Combined” and “Refined
Concept #3” to evaluate the compatibility of individual concepts and potential for phasing
improvements. Figure 18 illustrates the combined concepts.

The I-95 NB off-ramp to S. Crater Road illustrated in Refined Concepts #1 & #2 Combined would need to
be removed to construct the right-hand exit flyover ramp and provide appropriate merge/weave
distances on the C-D road. Movements affected by the removal of the off-ramp would instead be
served by the reconfigured I-95 northbound off-ramp to Route 460 Bus. Unlike Refined Concept #3, the
existing loop ramp to I-85 southbound could be removed and travel demand between S. Crater Road
southbound and I-85 southbound would be served on other network elements.

COST ESTIMATES
Timmons Group prepared planning level three phased cost estimates (Preliminary Engineering, Right of
Way, and Construction) for the various alternatives presented in this report. Base mapping was
developed to serve as a basis for developing the estimates, and was prepared through the following
process.
          Obtained and reviewed available VDOT record drawings for the study area
          Obtained GIS information for the City of Petersburg and converted to AutoCAD. Shape file
           information included: topographical information, existing waterlines, existing sanitary sewer
           lines, existing right of way lines, existing property owner lines, existing structures, driveways,
           roads, etc.
          Positioned the City GIS information onto City aerial photogrammetry to complete the base
           mapping
          Conducted a site visit to the project area to field verify the mapping

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
A Preliminary Environmental Assessment report was developed for the project area. The full findings of
this report are available for viewing as necessary upon request. An environmental inventory map is
shown below as Figure 19.

A certified wetlands scientist visited the project area and performed a preliminary wetland assessment
of the area on June 18, 2014. This included a review of the US Fish and Wildlife’s National Wetland
Inventory (NWI) mapping and the US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conversation
Service Web Soil Survey. A preliminary wetlands assessment map is shown below as Figure 20.

An online database research of the project area was performed to identify any cultural resources,
threatened & endangered (T&E) species, and hazardous materials within the project limits. Additional
study would have to be done on all of these areas once a project began to move forward.

Federal and State T&E information was obtained using resources from the Virginia Game and Inland
Fisheries (VaFWIS) database and the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Natural
Heritage Program database. No adverse impacts to current endangered or threatened species were
identified within the study area. However, it should be noted that the Northern Long Eared Bat may be
added to the list of endangered species in 2015, whose habitat is predominantly wooded areas such as
those found in the study area. Refer to the VaFWIS Department of Game and Inland Fisheries map
below in Figure 21.

A query of the Virginia Department of Historic Resource’s (VDHR) Virginia Cultural Resources
Information System (V-CRIS) was performed for the project area. While multiple architectural resources
associated with the Petersburg National Battlefield were identified within the study area, a preliminary
review indicates none of the Concepts would adversely impact these resources. Additional studies will
be required when/if a Concept moves forward to conclusively determine the potential significance of
the resources.

An online search with Environmental Data Resources, Inc. with GeoCheck revealed no projects related
to the I-95/I-85 Interchange area listed on any of the reviewed state databases.

BASE MAPPING
After assembling all of the topographic features, utility information, property lines, environmental
constraints, etc., available information was combined into one overall digital map. City topographic
features from GIS data were used to create a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) for preliminary profiles and
sections for each Concept. Concept alignments were then overlaid and assigned stationing for
generating profiles for various design features used to estimate costs.

COST ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY
Variables considered in the cost estimates include:

          Roadway improvements
          Ramp improvements
          Drainage improvements
          Traffic signal additions
          Storm water management facilities
          Bridge improvements
          Utility adjustments
          Environmental impacts (mitigation)
          Survey and design
          Interchange Modification Report
          Wetlands permitting
          Environmental documentation
          Right of Way acquisition costs
          Right of Way real property costs
          Relocation costs
          Demolition costs
          Construction Engineering & Inspection costs
          VDOT Administration costs
          Contingencies

For right of way costs, assessed value information taken from the City of Petersburg GIS data was
increased by 25% to reasonably represent the difference between assessed value and fair market value.
All right of way acquisition costs were based on the assumption that a full appraisal would be required
for each affected parcel, and all costs were projected to be in year 2021 Fiscal Year dollars.

Combining Concepts would likely introduce economies of scale if complimentary Concepts were
advanced together as one large project as opposed to many different, smaller projects. For the
purposes of these preliminary cost estimates, it is assumed that any project(s) derived from the

identified Concepts would be moved forward as a traditional Design-Bid-Build (under a normal VDOT
schedule process) approach as opposed to a Design-Build approach.

COST ESTIMATES
Cost estimates and a brief description for each Concept are provided below. When possible, Concepts
were broken out into smaller “Projects” when stand-alone improvements/modifications could be
isolated. The ability to isolate Projects was governed by a desire to retain all existing
movements/connections, thereby avoiding a long-term loss of connectivity on the roadway network.

Refined Concept #1
This Concept has been broken out into three separate projects (A, B, and C). Project A would eliminate
the loop ramp to I-95 southbound from S. Crater Road, realign Graham Road and the I-95 on-ramp to
intersect, and create separate north- and southbound left-turn lanes on S. Crater Road. Project B would
eliminate the I-95 southbound C-D road off-ramp to Graham Road and construct a new off-ramp to S.
Crater Road from the Route 460 Bus./I-95 southbound split. Project C assumes construction of a 150-
space park and ride lot in the vacated loop area. Key considerations of this Concept include the
following:

          The new off-ramp alignment is designed to avoid the Poor Creek pump station and sanitary
           force mains.

Estimated costs for Refined Concept #1 are summarized below.

          Project A Cost: $3.3M
          Project B Cost: $8.1M
          Project C Cost: $750,000
          Total Refined Concept #1 Cost: $12.15M

Refined Concept #2
This Concept has been broken out into two separate projects (A and B). Project A includes intersection
improvements on S. Crater Road north of I-95, Winfield Road corridor improvements, and modifications
to the Winfield Road/Route 460 Bus. intersection as well as the I-95 northbound on-ramp and C-D road.
Project B includes improvements to the I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road, Graham Road
widening, and modifications to the Graham Road/S. Crater Road intersection.

Project B does not directly address the identified weaving issue on the I-95 NB C-D road. Rather,
Project B includes improvements that address operational/capacity issues identified in the no-build
analysis on the south side of I-95 at the Graham Road/ I-95 Off-Ramp and Graham Road/S. Crater Road
intersections. It should be noted that this particular project would largely conflict with Project A from
Refined Concept #1, or if implemented prior to Project A from Refined Concept #1 require significant
reconstruction and additional cost.

Key considerations of this Concept include the following:

          Winfield Road should not be widened to the north to avoid impacting existing cultural
           resources.
          Increased traffic volumes on Winfield Road require further investigation of access management
           policies and should include outreach to affected business and property owners along this
           corridor.
          Realigning the Graham Road off ramp with Rosewood Terrace (the existing offset subdivision
           road across from the Graham Road off ramp) or vice versa will require some right of way.
          Widening along Graham Road is assumed to be towards the Limited Access Right of Way in lieu
           of towards the outside to reduce right of way impacts. Impacts to properties along S. Crater
           Road south of Graham Road are anticipated.

Estimated costs for Refined Concept #2 are summarized below.

          Project A Cost: $11.6M
          Project B Cost: $3.8M
          Total Refined Concept #2 Cost: $15.4M

Refined Concept #3
This Concept would provide a flyover ramp to serve I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound movements
and is designed with a right-hand exit configuration. Key considerations of this Concept include the
following:

          A right-hand exit design increases impacts to property owners in the Bellevue Avenue corridor
           relative to the original left-hand exit design. However, the right-hand exit design incorporates
           contemporary geometric design principles, better meets driver expectations, and avoids costly
           reconstruction of the I-95 main line.

Estimated costs for Refined Concept #3 are summarized below.

          Total Refined Concept #3 Cost: $92.4M

Refined Concept #1 & #2 Combined
As reflected in the name, this Concept would combine Refined Concepts #1 and #2, but also provides a
new two-way extension of Route 460 Bus. from I-95 to S. Crater Road. This Concept has been broken
out into four separate projects (A, B, C, and D). Project A is similar to Project A of Refined Concept #1
discussed earlier. Project B is similar to Project A of Refined Concept #2 except that it does not include
improvements (widening) to Winfield Road to the same extent or to the County Road corridor. Project
C includes the elimination of the I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road (similar to Project B of
Refined Concept #1), but creates a new intersection with the extension of Route 460 Bus. as opposed to
a free-flow off-ramp connection to S. Crater Road. Project D assumes construction of a 150-space park
and ride lot in the vacated loop area. Key considerations of this Concept include the following:

Kittelson & Associates, Inc.                                                                               50

          The alignment of the Route 460 Bus. extension to S. Crater Road is designed to avoid the Poor
           Creek Sanitary Pump Station and sanitary force mains.
          The design assumes that the existing Route 460 Bus. underpass of I-95 is not modified to
           accommodate two-way traffic (two travel lanes total) underneath the bridge.

Estimated costs for Refined Concept #1 & #2 Combined are summarized below.

          Project A Cost: $3.3M
          Project B Cost: $11.6M
          Project C Cost: $18.5M
          Project D Cost: $750,000
          Total Refined Concept #1 & #2 Combined Cost: $34.15M

Combined Concept
This Concept would merge Refined Concept #1 & #2 Combined with Refined Concept #3. At this
preliminary level it is reasonable to assume the individual cost estimates could be added to produce
overall estimate of roughly $131M. Key considerations of this Concept include the following:

          Additional costs associated with re-constructing portions of the I-95 Northbound C-D road
           between Route 460 Bus. and S. Crater Road may be incurred depending on how individual
           projects are phased.
               o The I-95 NB off-ramp to S. Crater Road illustrated in Refined Concepts #1 & #2
                   Combined would need to be removed to construct the right-hand exit flyover ramp and
                   provide appropriate merge/weave distances on the C-D road.
               o Movements affected by the removal of the off-ramp would instead be served by the
                   reconfigured I-95 northbound off-ramp to Route 460 Bus.
               o Unlike Refined Concept #3, the existing loop ramp to I-85 southbound could be removed
                   and travel demand between S. Crater Road southbound and I-85 southbound would be
                   served on other network elements.
          Strategically phasing improvements (assuming the “Combined Concept” would be constructed
           in several phases and not as one project) and anticipating future construction could help
           minimize reconstruction efforts/costs.

STUDY FINDINGS
The Virginia Department of Transportation Central Region Operations (VDOT-CRO) had Kittelson &
Associates, Inc. (KAI) conduct a feasibility analysis of three potential safety and operational projects at
the I-95/I-85 interchange in Petersburg, Virginia. The analysis considered and built upon information
from a 2013 study of the I-95 corridor.

The work efforts generally included evaluating historical crash data, reviewing and assessing previous
conceptual projects (developed by others), and developing new concepts and/or refining prior
concepts. Concept revisions and refinements incorporated contemporary planning, operations, design,
and safety performance considerations while considering three dimensional roadway design principles.
Order of magnitude cost opinions were also developed.

BACKGROUND
          Interstates 95 and 85, as well as Route 460 and US 301 (S. Crater Road), converge in Petersburg,
           Virginia in a complex series of interchanges developed in the mid-1950’s as part of the
           Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike. These interchanges reflect their vintage and do not necessarily
           reflect contemporary freeway and interchange planning, operations, design, and safety
           performance considerations.
          The designs exhibit short acceleration/deceleration lanes, relatively small radius turns, and
           relatively short weave/merge areas.
          The I-95/I-85 Interchange Roadway Safety Assessment Report published by Kimley-Horn &
           Associates, Inc. (KHA) in March 2013 was intended to be the first phase of an eventual larger
           I-95/I-85/Route 460 Interchange Area operations and conceptual design study that would
           update comprehensive planning study was conducted in the study same area between 1998
           and 2000 and identified a number of “capacity and safety issues” [sic].
          Issue #1: I-85 Northbound Off-Ramp to I-95 Southbound Weaving Section: The configuration of
           the I-85 northbound off-ramp to I-95 southbound movement results in periodic
           congestion/queuing leading into and through this section. The configuration includes a 250-foot
           weaving segment (between the I-85 northbound off-ramp merge with the I-95 southbound
           collector-distributor road and the Graham Road off-ramp) with an approximately 7% average
           uphill grade of the I-85 northbound off-ramp itself.
               o KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #1) that included the following
                    changes/modifications:
                                  Close the existing I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road;
                                  Close the existing I-95 southbound on-ramp from S. Crater Road;
                                  Reconstruct the Graham Road and S. Crater Road intersection and the on-ramp
                                   to southbound I-95 to allow southbound left-turn movement from S. Crater
                                   Road; and,
                                  Construct new I-95 off-ramp to S. Crater Road.

I-95/I-85 Interchange Feasibility Study                                                                 Study Findings


          Issue #2: S. Crater Road to I-95 Northbound Weaving Section: An approximately 360-foot
           weaving section exists between the S. Crater Road on-ramp to I-95 northbound movement and
           the off-ramp to the E. Wythe Street/E. Washington Street couplet in downtown Petersburg.
               o KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #2) to address this issue that included the
                   following changes/modifications:
                                  Close the existing I-95 northbound on-ramp from S. Crater Road and reuse the
                                   existing Winfield Road to relocate the northbound I-95 on-ramp connection to
                                   County Drive (Route 460 Bus.).
                                  Reconstruct two intersections to facilitate new traffic movements:
                                        Winfield Road/County Drive (Route 460 Bus.)
                                        Winfield Road/Crater Road
          Issue #3: I-95 Northbound Off-Ramp to I-85 Southbound Ramp Radius and Bridge Clearance:
           The existing I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound ramp has a 200 foot radius curve and the
           current bridge clearance for the ramp beneath I-95 is 13 feet 10 inches; it does not meet
           current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) minimum clearance requirements for
           interstates (16 feet).
               o KHA identified a long-term concept (Concept #3) to address this issue that included the
                   following changes/modifications:
                                  Close the existing I-95 northbound off-ramp to I-85 southbound and construct a
                                   new flyover ramp (left-hand exit) from I-95 northbound to I-85 southbound.

INITIAL CONCEPT EVALUATION
          KAI reviewed each long-term Concept to consider its feasibility. Criteria considered included:
               o Potential upstream and downstream impacts
               o Intersection/turn lane improvements
               o Design year peak hour operational performance (intersections)
                        LOS D or better
               o Application of contemporary planning, operations, design, and safety performance
                   features
               o Environmental, right-of-way, and utility impacts
               o Constructability
               o Estimated Cost
          KAI identified issues/questions that could not be immediately determined without further
           investigation, analysis, and/or refinement.

CONCEPT REVISIONS
          KAI revised each original concept to reflect contemporary planning, operations, design, and
           safety performance considerations. The revisions consider three dimensional roadway design
           principles.

          An iterative process of refining the concepts included:
               o Developing forecast design year 2040 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes
               o Reassigning forecast traffic to the transportation network based for each Concept
                   considered
               o Identifying necessary intersection-level details such as appropriate intersection control
                   and sizing of turn lanes
               o Confirming geometric design details (turn lanes/storages, horizontal and vertical
                   alignment, etc.)
               o Retaining current network connectivity to ensure no Concept would eliminate
                   connections that exist today
          KAI developed two additional evaluated the compatibility of individual concepts and potential
           for phasing improvements.
          Each revised Concept carried forward was ultimately refined and illustrated by KAI as a single-
           line taping. The tapings depict concepts reflecting contemporary planning, operations, design,
           and safety performance considerations, as well as three dimensional roadway design principles.
          Each configuration developed through this process helps clarify each Concept’s impact, cost,
           and feasibility with respect to the criteria discussed previously.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS
          VDOT staff selected a design year of 2040 to assess the potential design life of the concepts.
          Compounded annual growth (provided by VDOT) was adjusted to address identified imbalances
           (caused by different growth rates) that occurred between closely-spaced intersections.
          KAI performed an operational analysis for each refined Concept as well as a no-build condition.
          Each refined concept is forecast to meet VDOT performance criteria in the design year.

COST ESTIMATES
          Base mapping was developed to serve as a basis for developing the estimates. Data sources
           investigated to inform the mapping include:
               o VDOT record drawings
               o City of Petersburg GIS shape file data
               o US Fish and Wildlife’s National Wetland Inventory (NWI) mapping
               o US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conversation Service Web Soil Survey
               o Virginia Game and Inland Fisheries (VaFWIS) database
               o Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Natural Heritage Program

           desire to retain all existing movements/connections, thereby avoiding a long-term loss of
           connectivity on the roadway network.
          Refined Concept #1: This Concept has been broken out into three separate projects (A, B, and
           C).
               o Project A would eliminate the loop ramp to I-95 southbound from S. Crater Road, realign
                   Graham Road and the I-95 on-ramp to intersect, and create separate north- and
                   southbound left-turn lanes on S. Crater Road.
                         Project A Cost: $3.3M
               o Project B would eliminate the I-95 southbound C-D road off-ramp to Graham Road and
                   construct a new off-ramp to S. Crater Road from the Route 460 Bus./I-95 southbound
                   split.
                         Project B Cost: 8.1M
               o Project C would use the area in the vacated loop ramp as a potential future location for
                   a park and ride lot. Assuming Graham Road is realigned, there would be enough area to
                   provide roughly 150 parking spaces.
                         Project C Cost: $750,000
               o Total Refined Concept #1 Cost: $12.15M
          Refined Concept #2: This Concept has been broken out into two separate projects (A and B).
               o Project A includes intersection improvements on S. Crater Road north of I-95, Winfield
                   Road corridor improvements, and modifications to the Winfield Road/Route 460 Bus.
                   intersection as well as the I-95 northbound on-ramp and C-D road.
                         Project A Cost: $11.6M
               o Project B includes improvements to the I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road,
                   Graham Road widening, and modifications to the Graham Road/S. Crater Road
                   intersection.
                         Project B Cost: $3.8M
                         Note: Project B does not directly address the identified weaving issue on the I-95
                           NB C-D road. Rather, Project B includes improvements that address operational/
                           capacity issues identified in the no-build analysis on the south side of I-95 at the
                           Graham Road/ I-95 Off-Ramp and Graham Road/S. Crater Road intersections. It
                           should be noted that this particular project would largely conflict with Project A
                           from Refined Concept #1, or if implemented prior to Project A from Refined
                           Concept #1 require significant reconstruction and additional cost.
               o Total Refined Concept #2 Cost: $15.4M
          Refined Concept #3: This Concept would provide a flyover ramp to serve I-95 northbound to
           I-85 southbound movements and is designed with a right-hand exit configuration.
               o Total Refined Concept #3 Cost: $92.4M
          Refined Concept #1 & #2 Combined: This Concept would combine Refined Concepts #1 and #2,
           but also provides a new two-way extension of Route 460 Bus. from I-95 to S. Crater Road. This
           Concept has been broken out into four separate projects (A, B, C, and D).
               o Project A is similar to Project A of Refined Concept #1 discussed earlier.

               o Project B is similar to Project A of Refined Concept #2 except that it does not include
                  improvements (widening) to Winfield Road to the same extent or to the County Road

               o Project C includes the elimination of the I-95 southbound off-ramp to Graham Road
                  (similar to Project B of Refined Concept #1), but creates a new intersection with the
                  extension of Route 460 Bus. as opposed to a free-flow off-ramp connection to S. Crater

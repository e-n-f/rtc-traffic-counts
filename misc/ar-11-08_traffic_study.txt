Project Background
The proposed bus storage facility is located in the southwest quadrant of the future extension of SW 130th
Avenue / Highway 99W intersection. The site would be primarily used for the storage of buses and
maintenance vehicles, and would have two office buildings for employee use that would total
approximately 3,500 square feet. A preliminary site plan is attached.

The proposed bus yard would accommodate buses that are currently stored at the existing Highway 99W
site in Tigard, as well as some of the buses from the Hall Boulevard site. Initially, the proposed site
would serve approximately 40 buses and 10 maintenance vehicles, as well as employee parking for bus
drivers, maintenance staff, and the First Student dispatcher. Based on the proposed site plan, the full
capacity of the site would include the following:

        Buses (full size) = 61
        Buses (mini) = 11
        Maintenance vehicles = 19
        Standard passenger cars = 79

Site Traffic Patterns
Traffic generated at the site would generally include car/bus trips in and out of the site for the drivers
arriving and leaving during the morning and afternoon bus routes, as well as bus trips related to
extracurricular activities. Since the buses serve existing routes, only two portions of the vehicle trips
would be modified by the relocated bus yard: the portions between leaving the site and the first pick up
location and the last pick up location and returning to the site. The typical weekday would include the
following pattern of traffic entering and leaving the site:

AM Peak
   In the morning, drivers arrive at the site in passenger vehicle and leave the site driving the bus to
      pick up high school students. The first scheduled stops fall between approximately 6:45 to 7:10
      AM, so site trips generally occur before the morning peak hour.
   Seven routes do not serve the high school and would make the first stops for the other schools
      between approximately 7:35 and 8:10 AM. These site trips would likely occur during the
      morning peak hour.
   Final drop off for students at the middle school occurs between approximately 8:30 and 8:40 AM.
      Drivers would return the site with buses and leave in passenger cars afterward.

Midday Peak
    Elementary student pick up begins around 2:35 PM, followed by the other schools, with buses
       typically returning to the parking lot prior to the evening peak hour by 4:15 PM.

PM Peak
    While buses return to the storage facility prior to the evening peak hour, some employees will
      exit the bus facility during the evening peak hour.
    Bus traffic related to extra-curricular activities may occur during the evening peak hour.

                                                                                         December 12, 2011
                                                                                               Page 3 of 8


Site Access
The primary site access is proposed to be located on the future extension of SW 130th Avenue. This
public street extension will connect to Highway 99W and provide right-in right-out access to the highway.
The extension of SW 130th Avenue (currently under construction) will also connect to SW Leveton Drive,
which connects to SW 124th Avenue. An easement with the storage facility located east of the bus facility
site also exists. However the District intends that this access would only be used in cases where
inclement weather (such as snow or ice) makes the grade of the primary access unsafe to use. Generally
in such weather conditions the District has historically cancelled classes and not run bus service.
When leaving and entering the bus facility by bus, bus drivers will be directed to take 130th Avenue to
Leveton Drive to 124th Avenue, and then continue their routes from 124th Avenue. Bus drivers will be
instructed that they are not to access Highway 99W directly from 130th Ave pursuant to an
Administrative Rule that will be in effect prior to opening the new bus facility
Site Traffic Distribution
Traffic added to the surrounding street system was estimated for both employee and bus trips. The
employment distribution was approximated from the regional travel demand model. Less than half of the
auto trips would use Highway 99W (approximately 20 percent to the southwest and 25 percent to the
northeast), with the remainder traveling to the south/east areas of Tualatin. The School District also has a
bus storage facility located in Tigard that will continue to serve the northern (primarily Tigard) schools in
District. For this reason, the schools that are served by the buses at this proposed facility are primarily
located to the southeast (including Tualatin High School), with some located to the northeast as well. No
buses would travel to the west on Highway 99W. Most traffic to the site would access the site via SW
124th Avenue to SW Leveton Drive to SW 130th Avenue.

Median Cross-Over Traffic Volumes
Intersection turn movement counts were conducted in November 2011 at the two Highway 99W median
cross-overs (east and west of SW 130th Avenue) during the morning (6:00-9:00 a.m.), midday (2:00-4:00
p.m.), and evening peak (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) periods. Peak hour through volumes on Highway 99W were
adjusted by a factor of 1.09 to reflect conditions during the highest traffic volume month of the year (for
30th highest hour analysis) using factors from ODOT's Automated Traffic Recorder (ATR) site 36 -004
located just south of Sherwood. These adjustments account for traffic levels during the peak season
(typically July and August), which occurs during the summer school break when the site would not be
fully operating. However, this adjustment provides a conservative, "worst-case" analysis for traffic
volumes. The adjusted existing study intersection turn movements are shown in Figure 1.
Traffic would be added to streets in the vicinity to the site as described in the preceding section. Buses
would travel to/from the east and south of the site and would not be added to the traffic volumes at the
median cross-over locations. The site would support approximately 80 employee stalls. Applying the
employee trip distribution, this would yield approximately 16 employee trips to the southwest and 20
employee trips to the northeast. The remaining employee trips would travel to/from the southeast and
would not use Highway 99W.
Figure 2 shows the additional site traffic added to the median cross-overs assuming "worst-case" impacts
(i.e., all employee trips on Highway 99W would use the median cross-overs). As noted, employee traffic
could also use SW 130th and SW Leveton Drive to access the site, similar to the routes used by school
buses. Using the "worst-case" assumptions, the most traffic that would be added to one of the median
cross-over intersections would be 36 trips during a peak hour, less than the 50 vehicle/hour threshold used
by ODOT to determine if significant traffic is being added by a development.

Intersection Operations Analysis
An overview of traffic operations analysis is attached. The two study intersections are under ODOT
jurisdiction and are subject to intersection volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) standards (0.95 or better) as
defined in the Oregon Highway Plan (OHP) for the Portland Metropolitan Region. Existing and with site
peak hour operating conditions were determined based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual2
methodology for unsignalized intersections. Detail level of service calculation sheets are attached. All
movements at the median cross-overs would continue to meet ODOT mobility standards, even with the
inclusion of "worst-case" site traffic. Table 1 summarizes the intersection capacity analysis results.

Vehicle Queuing Analysis
A queuing analysis was performed to determine the potential for traffic queues on the median cross-overs
to exceed the storage capacity with the addition of the proposed development. The median cross-over
locations have limited vehicle storage between the divided Highway 99W. At each location
approximately 25 feet of storage is provided (adequate for one vehicle) for traffic travelling in either
direction. In addition, left turn deceleration pockets are provided on Highway 99W for vehicles
approaching the median cross-overs.
SimTraffic, a microsimulation analysis tool, was used to predict the 2011 peak hour queues for the left
turn within the median cross-overs as well as the left turn approaching the median crossovers. Ten
simulation iterations were run for each scenario, and each of the 60-minute simulation contained a peak
15-minute period that included the peak hour factor.
Simulation observations indicated that several of the 95th-percentile traffic queues with existing peak hour
traffic would exceed the vehicle storage within the median cross-overs. One location that currently does
not exceed storage would exceed storage with the "worst-case" assumptions of additional employee
traffic added to the median cross-overs. The 95th-percentile traffic queue for the northbound traffic at the
east median crossover has the potential to increase from 25 feet to 50 feet with the addition of site traffic
during the PM peak hour. This location currently exceeds storage during the existing midday peak hour
(also with a 50 foot queue). In addition, the 95th-percentile southbound queue of the west median cross-
over would increase from 50 to 75 feet with the addition of site traffic during both the AM and midday
peak hours. Table 2 lists the 95th-percentile queue and available storage by approach.

Safety Analysis
Archived collision data for Highway 99W was obtained from ODOT3 for the segment of highway one-
tenth of a mile in both directions from the two median crossover locations. This data represents collisions
reported during the last five full calendar years (2006-2010). The data was reviewed to identify collisions
that happened at (or due to) the two median cross-over locations.
A total of five collisions were reported between milepost 12.67 and 12.87, encompassing the east median
crossover location (located at milepost 12.77). However, none of these collisions were related to the
median crossover. Only two collisions were reported between milepost 13.01 and 13.21, including one
that was associated with the west median crossover. Based on reported data, the incident located at the
median crossover was an angle collision that appears to have been caused by a driver that was driving too
fast and ran the stop sign. The lone crash yields an incident rate at the intersection is 0.02 crashes per
million entering vehicles ­ well below the threshold of 1.0/MEV that generally signifies a safety issue.
No fatalities were reported at any of the intersections during the five year period.

Findings
The "worst-case" impact analysis indicated that the site has the potential to increase the 95th percentile
vehicle queues on the east median cross-over during one of the peak periods by one vehicle length and by
one vehicle length at the west cross-over during two peak periods. However, this impact could be averted
by TTSD directing employees to access the site via 124th Avenue and avoid the U-turn maneuvers at the
cross-overs. Such action would be enforced through an Administrative Rule that will be in effect prior to
opening the new bus facility. Because TTSD exercises a fairly significant level of control over its
employees as they enter and exit the worksite, this mitigation is feasible and is likely to be effective. No
additional off-site improvements are recommended to offset the traffic impacts for the site for the
following reasons:

        ODOT's "impact threshold" would not be met (less than 50 peak hour site trips would be added
        to the median cross-over locations)
        The median cross-overs meet ODOT mobility standards
        A review of historical collision data does not indicate a safety issue at the median cross-over
        locations
        TTSD will direct employees to not use the median cross-overs (through an Administrative Rule),
        eliminating traffic impacts to those locations.

TRAFFIC OPERATION ANALYSIS
While analysis of traffic flows is useful in attempting to reach an understanding of the general nature of
traffic in an area, traffic volume alone indicates neither the ability of the street network to carry additional
traffic nor the quality of service provided by the street facilities. For this reason, the concept of level of
service (LOS) has been developed to correlate traffic volume data to subjective descriptions of traffic
performance at intersections. Intersections are the controlling bottlenecks of traffic flow, and the ability
of a roadway system to carry traffic efficiently is nearly always diminished in their vicinity.
An intersection's level of service (LOS) is similar to a "report card" rating, based on average vehicle
delay. Level of Service A, B and C indicate conditions where vehicles can move freely. Level of service
D and E are progressively worse. For signalized intersections, level of service F represents conditions
where the average delay for all vehicles through the intersection exceeds 80 seconds per vehicle,
generally indicated by long queues and delays. Under this operating condition, delay is highly variable,
and it is difficult to estimate average delay accurately because congestion often extends into and is
affected by adjacent intersections. Descriptions of levels of service for signalized and unsignalized
intersections are contained in the Appendix.
The two study intersections are under ODOT jurisdiction and are subject to intersection volume-to-
capacity ratio (V/C) standards (0.95 or better) as defined in the Oregon Highway Plan (OHP) for the
Portland Metropolitan Region.

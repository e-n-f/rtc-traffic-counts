I.         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

     Mackenzie presents this Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) to address the potential impacts to
     intersections and corridors in the vicinity of the NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue intersection most
     affected by a proposed rezone and comprehensive plan amendment for 20.84 acres located at the
     intersection’s northeast corner. The analysis results are contained within this report.

     The site proposed for rezoning is comprised of five contiguous parcels. The two northern parcels
     containing 8.12 acres are zoned Residential (R-18) and are designated Urban Medium Density
     Residential (UM) on the Clark County comprehensive plan. The three southern parcels containing 12.72
     acres are zoned Light Industrial (IL) and are designated Industrial (I) on the County’s comprehensive
     plan. Figure 2 presents the current parcel configuration. All five parcels are proposed to be zoned
     Highway Commercial (CH) with comprehensive plan designations of General Commercial (GC).

     Future roadway conditions are estimated based on the following inputs:
                 September 2014 traffic data collected in the site vicinity, including volumes and travel times
                  along the newly-connected NE 139th Street and its new interchange ramps with Interstate 5.
                 Planned roadway improvement projects, including the NE 10th Avenue extension from NE 149th
                  Street to NE 164th Street, but excluding Phase II of the Salmon Creek Interchange Project.
                 Anticipated traffic volume increases from approved in-process projects identified in the Clark
                  County TRAFFIX concurrency model.
                 Anticipated traffic volume increases from general background growth, calculated from RTC
                  regional transportation models as an average of 2.0% per year.

     The selected analysis year is 2035 to match the current MTP for Clark County. Figure 8 presents the 2035
     base intersection volumes without the site trips, and Figure 9 presents the anticipated 2035 intersection
     traffic controls and lane configurations.

     Transportation impacts of the proposed rezone are evaluated for the weekday PM peak hour based on
     the reasonable maximum development density and trip generation potential for both the current and
     proposed zoning conditions. In both cases, site access is assumed to be available to both NE 10th
     Avenue (across from NE 141st Street) and NE 16th Avenue (north of the new NE 139th Street overpass).

                 Current zoning, with a blend of residential and industrial uses, could generate 462 trips, all of
                  them primary trips due to the land use characteristics. Analysis of the 2035 With Current Zoning
                  scenario conservatively assumes all 462 site trips added to the roadway network; no reductions
                  are made for the site trips generated by the existing land uses. Figure 10 presents the site trips
                  based on current zoning.

                 Proposed zoning, with ITE Shopping Center uses assumed at 25% lot coverage, could generate
                  1,038 trips (353 pass-by trips + 685 primary trips). Analysis of the 2035 With Proposed Zoning
                  scenario adds these trips to the roadway network in place of the 462 trips possible under
                  current zoning. Figure 14 presents the total site trips based on proposed zoning.

     The proposed rezone could generate 223 net new (primary) trips over the current zoning. Figure 15
     presents the proposed rezone’s net trip impact of 576 trips (353 pass-by trips + 223 primary trips) added
     to the roadway network.

Intersection performance is evaluated for comparison to the WSDOT and Clark County standards based
on HCM 2000 methodology or, for roundabouts, HCM 2010 methodology. Findings include:

            The high rate of background growth applied to the 2014 count volumes leads to over-capacity
             conditions at two study area intersections: NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue and NE 134th
             Street/Interstate 205 Northbound Off Ramp – NE 23rd Avenue.

            In many cases the background growth leads to higher intersection volumes than found in the
             RTC model projections for 2035, suggesting this TIA presents a more conservative analysis than
             regional modeling anticipates.

            The proposed rezone does not cause any intersection or lane group to exceed the applicable
             performance standard. The rezone does exacerbate over-capacity conditions at the two over-
             capacity intersections noted above.

            Mitigation measures are recommended for the intersections with performance deficiencies in
             the 2035 With Proposed Zone scenario.

Corridor performance is evaluated for comparison to the Clark County standards based on correlation
between travel time measurements and HCM intersection delay. Findings include:

            NE 139th Street travel speeds averaged 21 mph westbound and 20 mph eastbound in 2014.

            With full development under current site zoning, these speeds are estimated to decrease to 15
             mph westbound and 19 mph eastbound in 2035.

            With full development with the proposed rezone, these speeds are estimated to decrease to 13
             mph westbound and 17 mph eastbound. With the intersection mitigations described below,
             these speeds are estimated to range between 15 and 17 mph westbound, and between 14 and
             15 mph eastbound. In all cases, the 13 mph County minimum is met or exceeded.

Based on the TIA findings, the proposed rezone and comprehensive plan amendment can meet agency
standards and/or mitigate its impacts if the following (or similar) mitigation measures are provided:

            Install a westbound right turn lane on NE 139th Street at NE 10th Avenue with an overlap phase.

            Modify the southbound NE 10th Avenue approach to NE 139th Street to provide either:
                         a second southbound left turn lane, or
                         a shared through-left center lane and split phasing with the northbound approach.

            Modify the southbound NE 23rd Avenue approach to NE 134th Street to provide either:
                         a shared left-right lane with the existing exclusive right turn lane, or
                         an overlap phase for the existing right turn lane.

            Install a traffic control device at the site access to NE 10th Avenue, opposite NE 141st Street:
             either a traffic signal or a roundabout.

* All parcels lie within the 98685 ZIP code for Vancouver, Washington

            The site is bounded by NE 139th Street to the south, NE 10th Avenue to the west, the Mobile Retreat
            Residential Community to the north, and the NE 16th Avenue/Interstate 5 right-of-way to the east.
            Figure 2 presents the current parcel configuration.

            Project Description

            As noted in the table above, among the five parcels comprising the site, the two northern parcels
            currently are zoned Residential (R-18) and designated Urban Medium Density Residential (UM) in the
            comprehensive plan. The three southern parcels along NE 139th Street currently are zoned Light
            Industrial (IL) and designated Industrial (I) in the comprehensive plan.

            The proposed zone for all five parcels is Highway Commercial (CH), and the proposed comprehensive
            plan designation is General Commercial (GC).

            This TIA addresses the impact of the site’s increased trip generation potential based on the proposed
            rezone.

Scope of Analysis

This TIA analyzes the transportation system performance in 2035, the future plan year of the current
Metropolitan Transportation Plan for Clark County (2011 Update, prepared by Southwest Washington
Regional Transportation Council). Two (2) future analysis scenarios both assume full development of the
subject site, one (1) with the current zoning and one (1) with the proposed zoning. Weekday PM peak
hour analyses are presented for the following scenarios:
            2035 With Current Zone
            2035 With Proposed Zone

This TIA addresses Clark County standards for transportation impact studies identified in Clark County
Code (CCC) 40.350.020.D. Intersection analyses are presented for the following intersections.
            NE 149th Street/NE 10th Avenue
            NE 141st Street – Site Access/NE 10th Avenue
            NE 139th Street/NE Tenney Road
            NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue
            NE 139th Street/Interstate 5 Southbound On Ramp
            NE 139th Street/Interstate 5 Northbound Off Ramp
            NE 139th Street/Interstate 5 Northbound On Ramp
            NE 139th Street/NE 20th Avenue
            NE 136th Street – Driveways/NE 10th Avenue
            NE Tenney Road – NE 134th Street/NE 10th Avenue
            NE 134th Street/Interstate 5 Southbound On Ramp
            NE 134th Street/Interstate 5 Northbound Off Ramp
            NE 134th Street/Interstate 205 Southbound Off Ramp – NE Highway 99
            NE 134th Street/NE 20th Avenue
            NE 134th Street/Interstate 205 Southbound On Ramp
            NE 134th Street/Interstate 205 Northbound Off Ramp – NE 23rd Avenue

The geographic scope of this analysis does not represent the maximum extent possible under CCC
40.350.020.D.5 because this is a long-range planning level exercise rather than a project-specific
concurrency analysis. The latter would not analyze 2035 impacts but typically would analyze only a five-
year period. In order to better analyze the comparative impacts of the current and proposed zoning for
long-range planning purposes, this report analyzes the locations likely to experience the greatest
potential impacts from the proposed changes over the course of the twenty year planning horizon.

Travel time/roadway speed analyses are presented for the following corridors of regional significance.
            NE 139th Street, from NE 3rd Court to NE 29th Avenue
            NE Tenney Road – NE 134th Street, from NE 3rd Court to NE 23rd Avenue

As with the intersection study area, the geographic scope of this analysis does not represent the
maximum possible extent for concurrency analysis. These corridors are selected for analysis because
they are likely to experience the greatest potential impacts from the proposed changes over the course
of the twenty year planning horizon.

III.         CURRENT ZONING AND ROADWAY CONDITIONS

       Recent construction activities have provided a significantly updated interchange from 2010 conditions,
       including widened roadways; enhanced intersection controls; new sidewalks and curbs; new freeway
       ramps; a new NE 139th Street overpass crossing the freeways; and a relocated transit park-and-ride
       facility. Roadways were opened to vehicle traffic in August 2014, and the following review addresses
       these recently improved conditions.

       Site Conditions

       The subject site is comprised of five contiguous parcels located at the northeast corner of the NE 139th
       Street/NE 10th Avenue intersection. Portions of the site are developed to varying degrees:
                   Lot 19 is partially developed with a veterinary hospital and associated paved parking.
                   Lots 54 and 82 are partially developed with single-family residences and ancillary outbuildings.
                   Lot 83 is fully developed as a contractor’s yard, shop, and office, plus one (1) single-family
                    residence.
                   Lot 152 is entirely undeveloped.

       The parcels currently access NE 10th Avenue and NE 16th Avenue.

       Intersection Lane Geometry and Signal Timing

       Most the study area intersections operate with signal control; exceptions are listed below:
                   NE 149th Street/NE 10th Avenue: two-way stop control; minor approach (eastbound NE 149th
                    Street) right turn permitted without stopping
                   NE 141st Street – Site Access/NE 10th Avenue: two-way stop control
                   NE 139th Street/Interstate 5 Northbound On Ramp: yield control
                   NE 136th Street – Driveways/NE 10th Avenue: single-lane roundabout
                   NE 134th Street/Interstate 205 Southbound On Ramp: yield control

       Figure 3 presents current intersection traffic controls and lane configurations.

       Current Traffic Volumes

       Turning movement count data were collected at study area intersections during the PM peak period
       (4:00-6:00 PM) on September 23, 2014. The system peak hour was identified as 4:40 – 5:40 PM for this
       analysis. Figure 4 presents a summary of the current traffic volumes during the system peak hour.
       Copies of the data reports are provided in the Appendix.

       Trip Generation, Distribution, and Assignment

       Overall, the site is under-developed based on current zoning conditions. Trips generated by the current
       uses (veterinary hospital, single-family residences, and contractor’s yard) are included in the current
       traffic volume counts in their current distribution patterns.

IV.         FUTURE VOLUMES AND ROADWAY CONDITIONS

      Study area transportation system characteristics, including volumes and intersection/roadway
      geometry, are estimated as part of the future year conditions analyses. Year 2035 analyses are
      presented to match the plan year of the regional transportation model and Metropolitan Transportation
      Plan for Clark County (2011 Update) prepared by Southwest Washington RTC.

      Future Traffic Volumes

      Traffic volume projections for 2035 are estimated with both general long-range increases in traffic
      volumes, referred to as background growth, and with increases to specific traffic movements from
      specific approved development projects, referred to as in-process volumes.

      Background Growth

      Traffic volumes within the study area are estimated to increase at an average annual rate of 2.0%. This
      growth rate is developed from the RTC regional transportation models, which indicate traffic volumes
      on nearby roadways will increase, on average, at a compounded rate of approximately 2.0% per year
      from the base model year (2010) to the future plan year (2035) after in-process trips (see below) are
      subtracted. The selected 2.0% growth rate, compounded annually, is applied to all intersection
      movement volumes to calculate the general increases in study area volumes. Figure 5 presents a
      summary of the background growth volumes. Background growth rate calculations are presented in the
      Appendix.

      In-Process Volumes

      Specific traffic volume increases due to nearby site developments that are approved, but not yet fully
      occupied are defined as in-process traffic for intersection analysis. Clark County uses a TRAFFIX software
      model to track PM peak hour trips associated with these projects for concurrency purposes. For this TIA
      the TRAFFIX database was refined to (a) remove the trip assignments for projects complete or expired;
      (b) reduce proportionally the trip assignments for projects partially complete; and (c) confirm
      incomplete or unoccupied developments. The remaining in-process trip assignments were added to the
      analysis volumes. The trip assignments for the recently approved Salmon Creek Retail project (FSR2014-
      00005) were also added to the in-process volumes because it is not included in the concurrency model.

      Figure 6 presents a summary of the applicable in-process volumes.

      Planned Improvements

      Planned improvements to the study area transportation system are identified in Appendix B of the RTC
      Metropolitan Transportation Plan, 2011 Update, and in the Clark County 2014-2019 Transportation
      Improvement Program (TIP). Specifically:
                  RTC Tables B-3 and B-4 identify projects fully funded for completion in the near term.
                  RTC Tables B-5 and B-6 identify projects programmed (regardless of funding) for completion
                   within the planning horizon, i.e., by 2035.
                  The County TIP identifies project status and funding levels.

Traffic Volume Adjustments

The NE 10th Avenue extension project noted above will complete a north-south roadway link parallel to
Interstate 5 between the interchanges at NE 134th/139th Streets and NE 179th Street. It is anticipated
some drivers would choose NE 10th Avenue where currently they choose Interstate 5, and some drivers
traveling to and from the north on I-5 would use the 179th Street interchange instead of the Salmon
Creek interchange. The 2035 future intersection volumes are adjusted based on the RTC model volume
splits between NE 10th Avenue and Interstate 5. Figure 7 presents a summary of the traffic volume
adjustments resulting from planned future improvements.

Figure 8 presents the 2035 base intersection volumes or the sum of current volumes, background
growth volumes, in-process volumes, and traffic volume adjustments for planned improvements. Site
trips are added to these base volumes for the current zoning and proposed zoning, respectively, to
generate the 2035 analysis scenarios.

Intersection Lane Geometry and Signal Timing

Following the planned improvements identified above, most the study area intersections will operate
with signal control in 2035; exceptions are listed below.
            NE 149th Street/NE 10th Avenue: two-way stop control; southbound stop on NE 10th Avenue
             removed; eastbound right-turn permitted without stopping also removed
            NE 141st Street – Site Access/NE 10th Avenue: two-way stop control
            NE 139th Street/Interstate 5 Northbound On Ramp: yield control
            NE 136th Street – Driveways/NE 10th Avenue: single-lane roundabout
            NE 134th Street/Interstate 205 Southbound on Ramp: yield control (Note: this intersection
             could be converted, removed, or relocated with the SCIP Phase II project)

Figure 9 presents future intersection traffic controls and lane configurations.

Site Conditions

For 2035 With Current Zone analysis, a reasonable maximum development density and trip generation
potential are estimated for the subject site under current zoning conditions. Based on the prior
consultants’ efforts, industrial park uses (at 25% lot coverage) are assumed for the three parcels (12.92
acres) zoned Light Industrial (IL), and residential apartment uses (at 18 units per acre) are assumed for
the two parcels (8.12 acres) zoned Residential (R-18). For purposes of this analysis it is assumed the
developments would share accesses to NE 10th Avenue and NE 16th Avenue.

Trip Generation, Distribution, and Assignment

As part of a prior rezone application (Clark County Case File No. CPZ2008-00022), Hopper Dennis Jellison
(HDJ) evaluated the site’s maximum trip generation potential based on current zoning conditions. The
application received County approval contingent upon the site generating no more trips with the rezone
than would be generated by development(s) under current zoning. As identified in Condition 2a of the
November 18, 2008, draft Concomitant Rezone Agreement, the site could generate up to 462 trips
during the weekday PM peak hour under current zoning.


H:\Projects\213038908\WP\RPT-Clark County-TIA-141003.docx                                                   8
The residential and light industrial land uses allowed under the current zoning generate only primary
trips; pass-by trips are not assumed for either industrial or residential uses. Thus the 462 trips projected
with the current zoning are assumed to be the net new site trips to the transportation system for the
current zoning. Based on the relative areas of the current zones and the trip characteristics of each
zone, entering trips are estimated to represent approximately 34% of the total trips or 157 trips, and
exiting trips are estimated to represent approximately 66% of the total trips or 305 trips, during the
weekday PM peak hour.

As a conservative estimate, all 462 site trips are added to the future roadway network. No reductions
are made for the current site trips generated by the existing land uses.

For this analysis, volumes at the study area intersections are estimated based on the following
distribution, based on the select zone assignment patterns for TAZ 95 in the 2035 RTC model:
            11% to/from NE 10th Avenue north of NE 149th Street
            11% to/from NE 149th Street west of NE 10th Avenue
            6% to/from NE 139th Street west of NE Tenney Road
            22% to/from Interstate 5 south (16% via NE 139th Street + 6% via NE 134th Street)
            8% to/from NE Highway 99 south of NE 134th Street
            18% to/from Interstate 205 south via NE 134th Street
            0% to/from NE 134th Street east of NE 23rd Avenue
            7% to/from NE 139th Street east of NE 20th Avenue
            2% to/from NE 20th Avenue north of NE 139th Street
            15% to/from Interstate 5 north of NE 139th Street

Figure 10 presents the site trip distribution patterns and assignments based on the site’s current zoning.
RTC model outputs are provided in the Appendix.

Current Zone Future Analysis Scenario

Traffic volumes for the 2035 With Current Zone analysis scenario represent the sum of current volumes,
background growth volumes, in-process volumes, and traffic volume adjustments for planned
improvements, plus 462 site trips at the site access intersections. Figure 11 presents the 2035 With
Current Zone traffic volumes during the weekday PM peak hour.

V.         PROPOSED ZONING COND ITIONS

     The proposed rezone is anticipated to increase the site’s maximum trip generation potential based on
     the allowed development densities and the typical traffic characteristics of the assumed land uses. The
     following discussion reviews the potential changes.

     Site Conditions

     For 2035 With Proposed Zone analysis, a reasonable maximum development density and trip generation
     potential are assumed for the subject site under the proposed zoning. Based on our experience with
     similar development projects, general retail uses at 25% lot coverage are assumed for the five parcels
     (20.84 acres) zoned Highway Commercial (CH). This maximum development is assumed to include a
     variety of sizes and types of retail tenants housed in several buildings. This development pattern
     accommodates tenant flexibility without giving way to “big box” developments (any one retailer
     occupying over 100,000 SF of floor area) prohibited in Condition 2b of the November 18, 2008, draft
     Concomitant Rezone Agreement. It is further assumed the development would access NE 10th Avenue
     and NE 16th Avenue, consistent with the current zone assumptions. These assumptions seem
     reasonable given the proposed contiguous commercial zoning and the potential for unified site
     development patterns.

     Rezone Site Trips

     Trip Generation

     The maximum trip generation with proposed zoning is calculated based on the development
     assumptions described above in the Site Conditions section. For the proposed Highway Commercial (CH)
     zone, trip generation characteristics are calculated based on Land Use Code 820 – Shopping Center in
     the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (2012). This land use
     category covers a wide variety of possible retail uses and sizes. The following table presents a summary
     of the proposed trip generation characteristics.

     Trip Types

     The calculations in the above table address total site trips, including all external trip types: pass-by,
     diverted linked, and primary trips (the Shopping Center land use model inherently accounts for internal
     trips between individual retail users, so no reductions are made for internal/shared trips). For purposes
     of this analysis, the following apply.
                 Pass-by trips are drawn from traffic flows on NE 10th Avenue and NE 139th Street. Trip
                  distribution patterns are addressed below.


     H:\Projects\213038908\WP\RPT-Clark County-TIA-141003.docx                                                                    10
            Diverted linked trips could be drawn from traffic flows on Tenney Road-NE 134th Street,
             Highway 99-NE 20th Avenue, Interstate 5, and/or Interstate 205. Given the study area for this
             TIA, diverted linked trip movements could appear similar to those of primary trips. For
             simplicity, diverted linked trips are modeled as primary trips.
            Primary trips are drawn from origins outside the study area. Trip distribution patterns are
             addressed below.

Table F.9 in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 3rd Edition (2014), indicates pass-by trips at a Shopping
Center use comprise approximately 34% of external site trips during the weekday PM peak hour. In this
calculation, ITE refers to diverted linked trips and primary trips together as “non-pass-by” trips. As noted
above, for this TIA, all non-pass-by trips are treated the same as primary trips. The following table
provides a summary of the trip types under the proposed zone.

Net Trip Impact

The numeric trip impact of the proposed rezone is evaluated as the net increase in trip generation
potential from the current zoning to the proposed zone. The maximum trip generation with current
zoning, as noted above in the Future Volumes and Roadway Conditions section, is 462 trips during the
weekday PM peak hour. The residential and light industrial land uses allowed under the current site
zoning generate only primary trips, so all 462 trips are assumed to be primary trips.

The retail uses allowed under the proposed zoning are anticipated to generate 353 pass-by trips in
addition to 685 primary trips.

The following table presents a summary of the net trip generation calculations, accounting separately
for each trip type.


                             TABLE 5 – NET TRIP GENERATION – WEEKDAY PM PEAK HOUR

                                                                                                Trips

The proposed rezone is anticipated to generate 576 more total weekday PM peak hour trips than
allowed under current zoning. These include 353 pass-by trips and 223 primary trips. Note that although
the primary trips are treated as equivalent between the current and proposed zoning conditions,

H:\Projects\213038908\WP\RPT-Clark County-TIA-141003.docx                                                               11
primary trips to/from industrial and residential uses tend to be of greater length than those to/from
retail uses. Thus, although the retail uses may generate a greater number of trips, the trips tend to be
shorter and generate less system impact than industrial or residential trips.

Trip Distribution and Assignment

For a Shopping Center land use, ITE indicates 48% of trips enter a site and 52% exit a site during the
weekday PM peak hour. Further trip distribution is addressed separately according to trip type.

Pass-By Trips

The pass-by trips are distributed based on the proportions of traffic traveling in each direction through
the NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue intersection, as indicated in the September 2014 counts.

The weekday PM peak hour trip distributions are estimated as follows:
            28% from eastbound NE 139th Street
            34% from westbound NE 139th Street
            18% from northbound NE 10th Avenue
            20% from southbound NE 10th Avenue

Figure 12 presents the pass-by trip distributions and assignments for the weekday PM peak hour.
Negative values identify movements from which trips have been rerouted.

Primary Trips

The distribution pattern for the net primary trips is estimated based on the select zone assignment
patterns for TAZ 90 and TAZ 236 in the 2035 RTC regional transportation model. Both zones encompass
existing retail sites various tenant types and sizes; consequently, they are anticipated to exhibit trip
distribution characteristics more in keeping with the proposed commercial site zoning and modeled
retail uses than would the characteristics of the current industrial site zoning or its subject select zone
(TAZ 95) in the 2035 RTC model. RTC model outputs are provided in the Appendix.

The resulting trip distribution pattern is as follows.
            4% to/from NE 10th Avenue north of NE 149th Street
            4% to/from NE 149th Street west of NE 10th Avenue
            15% to/from NE 139th Street west of NE Tenney Road
            22% to/from Interstate 5 south (15% via NE 139th Street + 7% via NE 134th Street)
            10% to/from NE Highway 99 south of NE 134th Street
            15% to/from Interstate 205 south via NE 134th Street
            5% to/from NE 134th Street east of NE 23rd Avenue
            7% to/from NE 139th Street east of NE 20th Avenue
            8% to/from NE 20th Avenue north of NE 139th Street
            10% to/from Interstate 5 north of NE 139th Street

The above distribution pattern is applied to the 685 primary trips to estimate the primary trip
assignment. Figure 13 presents the primary site trip distribution patterns and assignments throughout
the study area.

Proposed Zone Future Analysis Scenario

Traffic volumes for the 2035 With Proposed Zone analysis scenario represent the sum of current
volumes, background growth volumes, in-process volumes, and traffic volume adjustments for planned
improvements, plus the site trips for the proposed zone. Figure 16 presents the 2035 With Proposed
Zone traffic volumes during the weekday PM peak hour.

VI.         INTERSECTION PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

      Intersection analyses are presented for the weekday PM peak hour under the following two scenarios.
                  2035 With Current Zone
                  2035 With Proposed Zone

      Methodology, Assumptions, and Inputs

      Intersection operations analyses are presented for the weekday PM peak hour according to the
      Transportation Research Board’s Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 Edition (HCM 2000), methodologies
      for signalized and unsignalized intersections, and according to the HCM 2010 Edition for roundabouts.
      Trafficware’s Synchro software, Version 8, was used to implement the HCM methodologies and to
      report the results.

      The following assumptions are input to the analysis models.

      Peak hour factors (PHF) are applied by intersection as the greater of 2014 existing values or

                  0.95 for freeway ramps, principal arterials (Highway 99) minor arterials (NE 139th Street, NE
                   134th Street, NE 20th Avenue)
                  0.92 for collector arterials (NE 149th Street, NE 10th Avenue)

      Heavy vehicle percentages are applied by movement as the greater of 2014 existing values or 2%.

      Traffic signals in the study area are owned and maintained by Clark County. Copies of the current signal
      plans and timings were obtained from County staff to inform the basic signal inputs to the analyses. The
      current signal timing parameters were input to the base Synchro model, and were refined to provide
      simplified assumptions for this long-range analysis. Coordinated timing plans and offsets were optimized
      for both 2035 scenarios. The optimization yielded 150-second cycles (and some 75-second half-cycles)
      for the 2035 With Current Zone scenario and 154-second cycles (and some 77-second half-cycles) for the
      2035 with Proposed Zone scenario.

      Performance Standards

      HCM generally assesses intersection capacity characteristics by three measures of effectiveness (MOEs):
      volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio, level of service (LOS), and control delay per vehicle (delay). The
      applicable performance standards are as follows.

                  For ramp terminal intersections subject to Washington State Department of Transportation
                   (WSDOT) jurisdiction: the level of service (LOS) standard for state highways of regional
                   significance (HSS) in urban portions of Clark County is “D.”

                  For all other intersections subject to Clark County jurisdiction.
                               CCC 40.350.020.G.b provides “Within the designated transportation corridors, individual
                                movements at each signalized intersection of regional significance shall not exceed an
                                average of two (2) cycle lengths or two hundred forty (240) seconds of delay (whichever
                                is less).”



      H:\Projects\213038908\WP\RPT-Clark County-TIA-141003.docx                                                           14
                         CCC 40.350.020.G.c provides “Outside of designated transportation corridors, all
                          signalized intersections of regional significance shall achieve LOS D standards or
                          better….”
                         CCC 40.350.020.G.d provides “all unsignalized intersections of regional significance in
                          the unincorporated county shall achieve LOS E standards or better (if warrants are not
                          met). If warrants are met, unsignalized intersections of regional significance shall
                          achieve LOS D standards or better.” Based on conversations with County staff, this
                          standard is understood to apply at the NE 136th Street-Driveways/NE 10th Avenue
                          roundabout intersection.

Analysis Results

The following table presents the intersection performance analysis results. The intersection numbers
correspond with those found on the figures and on the Synchro reports. The reported results are
determined by intersection control as follows.
            At signalized study area intersections, the v/c ratio, LOS, and delay are reported for the overall
             intersection. Additionally, the highest delayed lane group is reported for comparison to Clark
             County’s delay standards.
            At unsignalized intersections the v/c ratio, LOS, and delay are reported for the critical lane.
            At roundabouts the LOS and delay are reported for the overall intersection. Additionally, the v/c
             ratio, LOS, and delay are reported for the critical approach.

The Synchro reports are provided in the Appendix.

As presented in the above table, performance results at four study area intersections exceed the
applicable standard or the available capacity. Mitigation measures for three of these locations are
addressed below in the Mitigation section. Mitigation measures not recommended at the NE 139th
Street/Interstate 5 Northbound On Ramp intersection because the rezone has only a minor impact on
critical delay, because the intersection was recently improved, because the conflicting westbound
analysis volumes are higher than projected in the RTC model, and because few mitigation measures are
likely available.

VII.         CORRIDOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

       Study area corridor analyses are presented for the weekday PM peak hour under the following three
       scenarios:
       1.           2014 Existing Conditions (for reference)
       2.           2035 With Current Zone
       3.           2035 With Proposed Zone

       Methodology, Assumptions, and Inputs

       Corridor travel time/roadway speed analyses are presented for the weekday PM peak hour as correlated
       calculations associated to the movement delay at the intermediate intersections. Travel time/roadway
       speed measurements were collected for the new NE 139th Street corridor to form the basis of this
       analysis.

       Performance Standards

       CCC Table 40.350.020-1 provides the applicable minimum performance standards as follows.

                   NW/NE 139th Street – Tenney Road – NE 134th Street, from Seward Road to I-5: 17 mph
                   NE 134th Street – Salmon Creek Avenue, from I-5 to Ne 50th Avenue: 13 mph

       The NE 139th Street corridor was recently connected between NE 10th Avenue and NE 20th Avenue.
       Clark County has not adopted standards for this new segment, but they are assumed to match those
       previously adopted and noted above for the NW/NE 139th Street-Tenney Road-NE 134th Street-Salmon
       Creek Avenue corridor.

       Analysis Results

       Travel time runs on the new NE 139th Street corridor between NE 3rd Court and NE 29th Avenue were
       conducted the same day as counts at the study area intersections. The average travel times were found
       to be 3 minutes 47 seconds westbound, and 3 minutes 52 seconds eastbound. Based on the distance
       between the reference points, if traffic were flowing freely at the posted 35 mph speed limit, the travel
       time would be approximately 2 minutes 13 seconds. Instead, based on the average travel times
       observed, the average travel speeds were calculated as 21 mph westbound, and 20 mph eastbound
       during the PM peak hour. The travel time data are provided in the Appendix.

       These existing roadway speed results were correlated with the average lane group delay (calculated
       according to HCM 2000 methodology) at study area intersections along the NE 139th Street corridor
       under existing conditions. Synchro reports are provided in the Appendix. For westbound travel, the
       existing lane group delays sum to 1 minute 34 seconds; for eastbound travel they sum to 1 minute 57
       seconds. The following table presents the existing average travel times and corresponding lane group
       delays for each intersection.

Delays for the 2035 With Current Zone scenario are estimated to total 170 seconds westbound and 114
seconds eastbound, corresponding to travel speeds of 15 mph and 19 mph, respectively.

Delays for the 2035 With Proposed Zone scenario are estimated to total 231 seconds westbound and
138 seconds eastbound, corresponding to travel speeds of 13 mph and 17 mph, respectively. These
values meet the travel speed minimum standard of 13 mph, so no mitigation is recommended.

With the intersection mitigations recommended at NE 10th Avenue, corridor travel speeds are
estimated to range between 15 and 17 mph westbound and between 14 and 15 mph eastbound. Again,
these values exceed the travel speed minimum of 13 mph, so no mitigation is recommended.




H:\Projects\213038908\WP\RPT-Clark County-TIA-141003.docx                                                                       18
VIII.         MITIGATION

        Three intersections are identified above as having correctable performance deficiencies. The following
        discussion addresses possible mitigation measures at these locations and offers recommendations. The
        goal of the mitigation measures, at a minimum, is to restore 2035 With Proposed Zone intersection
        operations to performance levels equal or better than those in the 2035 With Current Zone scenario. In
        this way, the proposed rezone can be shown to have no adverse effect as compared to current zone
        conditions. Synchro reports with the mitigation measures in place are provided in the Appendix.

        NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue

        In the 2035 With Current Zone scenario volumes are anticipated to exceed the overall intersection
        capacity, and three lane groups are also anticipated to exceed their available capacity. With the
        additional volume added in the 2035 With Proposed Zone scenario these conditions are anticipated to
        degrade, and one additional lane group is anticipated to exceed its available capacity. Note, however, in
        neither scenario is any lane group anticipated to exceed the Clark County maximum of 240 seconds of
        delay per vehicle.

        Mitigation is recommended to address two over-capacity movements where site trips in general, and
        the proposed rezone trips in particular are anticipated to add significant volumes: the westbound right
        and the southbound left. First, it is recommended to provide an exclusive westbound right turn lane
        with an overlap signal phase. With right turn movements comprising 45% (With Current Zone) to 54%
        (With Proposed Zone) of the lane group volume, the right-hand lane is likely to operate as a de facto
        right turn lane already. Providing a dedicated right turn lane would extract the right turn movements
        from the through lanes, and provide reserve capacity to the through movements. The overlap signal
        phase would match the phasing of the two existing right turn lanes at the intersection, and would
        complement the heavy southbound left turn volume.

        Second, it is recommended to provide a second lane for southbound left turn movements; either in a
        second exclusive southbound left turn lane (with the current protected signal phase) or in a shared
        southbound left-through lane (converted from the current exclusive southbound through lane). With
        the latter option, the signal would be modified to convert the northbound and southbound intersection
        approaches to split phasing. Either measure would provide reserve capacity to the southbound left
        movement.

        In combination, the exclusive westbound right turn lane (with overlap phase) and the second
        southbound left turn lane (either as a second exclusive lane or as a shared left-through lane) would
        allow the intersection to operate within its available capacity. Additional right-of-way for the additional
        lanes could be obtained by dedications from the rezone site frontage. The following table presents a
        summary of the HCM results, as reported by Synchro, for the mitigations.

       Note: Results are reported as v/c-LOS-Delay. Results formatted in BOLD font either exceed the applicable standard or
       exceed available capacity.

Based on the results, the second exclusive southbound left turn lane would provide greater benefits to
both the lane group and to the overall intersection.

NE 134th Street/Interstate 205 Northbound Off Ramp – NE 23rd Avenue

In the 2035 With Current Zone scenario intersection delay is anticipated to exceed the LOS F threshold,
exceeding the WSDOT LOS D standard; furthermore, volumes are anticipated to exceed the overall
intersection capacity, with four lane groups anticipated to exceed their available capacity, and one lane
group is anticipated to exceed the Clark County maximum of 240 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the
additional volume added in the 2035 With Proposed Zone scenario these conditions are anticipated to
continue or to degrade.

At this intersection it is relevant to note the intersection analyses presented in this TIA conservatively
overestimate 2035 traffic volume. In this location, for example, the total intersection volume estimated
in the 2035 With Current Zone scenario is 33% higher than projected in the RTC regional transportation
model. It is unlikely volumes will grow by 2% per year for the next 21 years in their current intersection
movement patterns. With that said, mitigation of the proposed rezone’s impacts, as analyzed, may be
straightforward. Two options are presented below.

Nearly 90% of vehicles approaching the intersection southbound are anticipated to make a right turn
movement from the existing exclusive lane. However, this lane group is anticipated to exceed the Clark
County maximum of 240 seconds of delay per vehicle. It is recommended to provide additional capacity
to the southbound right turn movement, either by implementation of a signal overlap phase or by
restriping the existing underutilized southbound left turn lane to a shared left-right lane. The shared
lane configuration is accommodated by the existing split signal phasing for northbound and southbound
approaches.

While the options presented would not restore full operating capacity to the intersection or to over-
capacity lane groups, either method of adding southbound right turn capacity would effectively mitigate

Based on the results, the shared southbound left-right lane would provide greater benefits to both the
lane group and to the overall intersection.

NE 141st Street – Site Access/NE 10th Avenue

In the 2035 With Current Zone scenario the westbound left turn lane is anticipated to exceed its
available capacity, and delay is anticipated to exceed the LOS F threshold. The westbound minor
approach volume meets traffic signal warrant minimums, so the applicable Clark County standard is LOS
D (traffic signal warrant charts are provided in the Appendix). With the additional volume added in the
2035 With Proposed Zone scenario these conditions are anticipated to degrade significantly. The need
for enhanced traffic control at this location is clear.

The heaviest volumes at this intersection are anticipated on the northbound and southbound through
movements, and on the westbound left turn movement. It is recommended to install either a traffic
signal or a roundabout to control the traffic flows. Either control measure could operate within
performance standards with certain provisions, for example if certain auxiliary lanes are provided to
accommodate high volume movements. Both control measures would demand a great deal of
refinement before a final layout could be confirmed; the analyses presented in this TIA serve only as
examples of feasible configurations. With either a signal or a roundabout, additional right-of-way could
be obtained by dedications from the rezone site frontage. The following table presents a summary of
the HCM results, as reported by Synchro, for the mitigations.

           Note: Results are reported as v/c-LOS-Delay. Results formatted in BOLD font either exceed the applicable
           standard or exceed available capacity.

Based on the Synchro models, either a traffic signal or a roundabout could mitigate the proposed
rezone’s impacts and could operate within performance standards. Important considerations in refining
either configuration would include lane assignments, lane alignments, queuing, and compatibility with
the mitigation measures implemented at the nearby NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue signalized
intersection. Given the preliminary nature of this analysis, and the consideration of a reasonable worst
case trip generation scenario, the actual mitigation measure should be determined at the time of a
development application.

Corridor Travel Speeds

With the proposed mitigation measures noted above for the NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue
intersection, the corridor travel speeds would range between 15 and 17 mph westbound and between
14 and 15 mph eastbound. These speeds exceed the County’s minimum threshold of 13 mph for
concurrency corridors.

IX.         SUMMARY AND RECOMMEN DATIONS

      This TIA supports the proposed rezone and comprehensive plan amendment for 20.84 acres located at
      the northeast corner of the NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue intersection. The site is comprised of five
      contiguous parcels; the two northern parcels covering 8.12 acres are zoned Residential (R-18) and
      designated Urban Medium Density Residential (UM); and the three southern parcels covering 12.72
      acres are zoned Light Industrial (IL) and designated Industrial (I). Figure 2 presents the current parcel
      configuration. All five parcels are proposed to be zoned Highway Commercial (CH) and designated
      General Commercial (GC).

      Future roadway traffic volumes were estimated by adding in-process traffic, background growth and
      rerouted traffic for the NE 10th Avenue extension to existing traffic counts from September 2014. In
      general, these estimates for 2035 conditions exceed the volumes presented in RTC’s 2035 model,
      especially at NE 134th Street east of NE 20th Avenue.

      Transportation impacts of the proposed rezone are evaluated for the weekday PM peak hour based on
      the reasonable maximum development density and trip generation potential for both the current and
      proposed zoning conditions.

                  Current zoning, with a blend of residential and industrial uses, could generate up to 462 trips, all
                   of them primary trips due to the land use characteristics. Analysis of the 2035 With Current
                   Zoning scenario conservatively assumes all 462 site trips added to the roadway network; no
                   reductions are made for the site trips generated by the existing land uses. Figure 10 presents the
                   site trips based on current zoning.

                  Proposed zoning, with ITE Shopping Center uses assumed at 25% lot coverage, could generate
                   up to 1,038 trips (353 pass-by trips + 685 primary trips). Analysis of the 2035 With Proposed
                   Zoning scenario adds these trips to the roadway network in place of the 462 trips possible under
                   current zoning. Figure 14 presents the total site trips based on proposed zoning.

      Intersection performance is evaluated for comparison to the WSDOT and Clark County standards based
      on HCM 2000 methodology or, for roundabouts, HCM 2010 methodology. Findings include:

                  The high rate of background growth applied to the 2014 count volumes leads to over-capacity
                   conditions at two study area intersections: NE 139th Street/NE 10th Avenue and NE 134th
                   Street/Interstate 205 Northbound Off Ramp – NE 23rd Avenue.

                  In many cases the background growth leads to higher intersection volumes than found in the
                   RTC model projections for 2035, suggesting this TIA presents a more conservative analysis than
                   regional modeling anticipates.

                  The proposed rezone does not cause any intersection or lane group to exceed the applicable
                   performance standard. The rezone does exacerbate over-capacity conditions at the two over-
                   capacity intersections noted above.

                  Mitigation measures are recommended for the intersections with performance deficiencies in
                   the 2035 With Proposed Zone scenario.

Corridor performance is evaluated for comparison to the Clark County standards based on correlation
between travel time measurements and HCM intersection delay. Findings include:

            NE 139th Street travel speeds averaged 21 mph westbound and 20 mph eastbound in 2014.

            With full development under current site zoning, these speeds are estimated to decrease to 15
             mph westbound and 19 mph eastbound in 2035.

            With full development with the proposed rezone, these speeds are estimated to decrease to 13
             mph westbound and 17 mph eastbound. With the mitigation measures identified below, the
             speeds are estimated to range between 15 and 17 mph westbound and between 14 and 15 mph
             eastbound. In all cases, the 13 mph County minimum is met or exceeded.

Recommended Mitigations

Based on the TIA findings, the proposed rezone and comprehensive plan amendment can meet agency
standards and/or mitigate its impacts if the following (or similar) mitigation measures are provided:

            Install a westbound right turn lane on NE 139th Street at NE 10th Avenue with an overlap phase.

            Modify the southbound NE 10th Avenue approach to NE 139th Street to provide either:
                         a second southbound left turn lane, or
                         a shared through-left center lane and split phasing with the northbound approach.

            Modify the southbound NE 23rd Avenue to NE 134th Street approach to provide either:
                         a shared left-right lane with the existing exclusive right turn lane, or
                         an overlap phase for the existing right turn lane.

            Install a traffic control device at the site access to NE 10th Avenue, opposite NE 141st Street,
             either:
                         a traffic signal, or
                         a roundabout.

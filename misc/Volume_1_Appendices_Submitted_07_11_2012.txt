                             1.0 BACKGROUND

SMR Resources LLC (SMR) has prepared this Aggregate Resource Evaluation and
Significance Determination for the proposed Comprehensive Plan Map and Zoning Map
Amendment for Dry Creek Landfill, Inc. The mining site is located at the Dry Creek
Landfill (DCLF, the Site) in Eagle Point, Jackson County, Oregon (Figure 1). Dry Creek
Landfill, Inc. has quarried rock for use in landfill cell construction for many years, but
any surplus rock cannot be deployed to market under the current land use permits. The
intent is to amend the Comprehensive Plan Map and Zoning Map to designate the subject
properties as a significant aggregate resource and provide Statewide Planning Goal 5
protection, under the Division 23 criteria. Jackson County adopted a Goal 5 protection
program for aggregate through Ordinance 2008-5. SMR's responsibility within this
amendment process is to provide documentation that the Site meets the significant
resource criteria.

The Comprehensive Plan Map and Zoning Map Amendment area is proposed for 680
acres and includes 16 tax lots. The existing aggregate quarry area encompasses 51 acres,
which will be expanded to 282 acres. The aggregate area is adjacent to 339 acres used by
Dry Creek Landfill, Inc. to landfill solid waste. Future landfill cell construction will be
conducted in areas of aggregate removal.

The tax lots or a portion of them, which we are addressing relative to the significance
criteria are as follows:

      x   Township 36 south, Range 1 west, Section 35 ­ Tax Lot 300
      x   Township 37 south, Range 1 west, Section 12 ­ Tax Lot 200
      x   Township 37 south, Range 1 west, Section 02 ­ Tax Lots 108, 109, 110, 111,
          112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 122, 200, 201, and 202


1.1       SCOPE OF GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
SMR personnel have worked as a consulting geologist/hydrogeologist at the Dry Creek
Landfill since 1990. SMR personnel have been involved since the original geologic-
hydrogeologic characterization was conducted. The author of this report has drilled and
installed over 25 groundwater monitoring wells at the Site, conducted test pitting in the
alluvium, drilled and installed numerous landfill gas geotechnical holes, and has drilled
and logged over 1200 feet of rock core advanced at the Site. During the fall of 2010
SMR personnel drilled and logged over 900-feet of rock core from one area of the
proposed project. For this significance criteria determination, SMR reviewed boring
logs, geologic cross sections, laboratory analytical data, and reserve estimate calculations
as provided for the project Site by Knife River Corporation (KRC).

Additionally KRC provided to SMR laboratory analytical results for representative
samples collected from the subject properties' quarry that supports landfill construction.
Goal 5 requires that samples of aggregate material from this Site meet Oregon
Department of Transportation (ODOT) specifications for "construction grade material".


Agg Eval Rpt_rev 1.doc                 Page 1 of 11
Goal 5 does not define specifically how many sets of samples or how the samples are
selected to be tested. This judgment is left up to the professional engineer or geologist to
make that determination. For purposes of this report, a representative sample can
generally be defined as samples that reflect the material characteristics present in the
geologic stratum from which they are derived. Figures 1 and 2 presented in this report
were prepared by CSA Planning Ltd., and Plate 1 was prepared by KRC.

In addition the following reports and references were reviewed:

    x   Dry Creek Landfill, Drill Hole Locations & Reserve Estimate, dated July 2009,
        prepared by the Knife River Corporation.(Plate 1)
    x   Oregon Administrative Rules, Division 023, Section 0180..
    x   Jackson County Comprehensive Plan, Aggregate and Mineral Resources,
        adopting Division 23 regulations through Ordinance 2008-05, dated April 30,
        2008.
    x   United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Engineering
        Geology Field Manual, Second Edition, 2001.

Our findings and conclusions presented in this report are based on the criteria set forth in
Jackson County Comprehensive Plan implementing OAR 660-023-0180, review of the
above listed reports, our historical knowledge of the Site geology including numerous
drilling programs, and the laboratory analytical results for representative samples.

                         2.0 SITE CONDITIONS
2.1    TOPOGRAPHY AND OPERATIONS DISCUSSION
The project site is located northeast of Medford and Interstate 5, within the Cascade
Mountain physiographic province in southwestern Oregon (Figure 1). The Site is located
amongst the western most volcanic rocks of the Cascade Mountains. The 282-acre
mining area has been identified by KRC as the North and South Reserve Areas. A
portion of the Site is currently being quarried, the extraction being limited to a small
quarry located west of the landfill cells. Processing of the aggregate resource occurs on-
Site using crushing and screening equipment to process and stockpile material for landfill
construction use.

A review of the existing Site conditions and topography supplied by KRC indicates
elevations in the North and South Reserve Areas ranges from 1,800 feet Mean Sea Level
(MSL) to 2,200 feet MSL. Several un-named ephemeral drainages cross cut the reserve
area trending southwest to northeast. The area is sparsely vegetated with native grasses
and scrub oak.

The aggregate area will be located to accommodate the landfill waste area modification.
The initial quarry location will be concentrated in the proposed low point of the modified
landfill waste area such that upon completion of quarry operations the elevation will be
suitable to maintain a gravity flow of leachate from the landfill lining system and into the
leachate collection ponds. Quarry development will be designed to accommodate the
construction of future landfill cells in the modified waste area. Aggregate operations may
occur on a year round basis and be conducted in advance of the need for future landfill
cells.

Quarry areas will be stripped of overburden material using earthmoving equipment. The
areas that have been stripped will then be drilled and blasted. The shot rock will be
transported to a crusher for processing. Crushing will take place on Site. Unsuitable
material (soft rock or dirt) will be used on site to construct embankments for landfill
development or used for offsite embankment. The crushed rock will be stockpiled on
Site as needed or transported offsite for other uses.

2.2    GEOLOGIC EVALUATION BY OTHERS
Knife River Corporation has prepared the report cited above which evaluated the area for
aggregate reserve. A summary plate showing drilling locations, the reserve areas, cross
sections, and aggregate reserve calculations is presented as Plate 1. KRC advanced
approximately 115 drill holes at the Site. Data from the boreholes indicates there are
approximately 14,270,000 tons or 7,132,935 cubic yards of crushed rock aggregate. The
minimum threshold criteria for Jackson County are 500,000 tons of resource on land
planned Agricultural Land; the 500,000 tons standard applies where aggregate operations
are planned on Agricultural land that does not contain Class I, Class II, prime or unique
agricultural soils, which this site does not.

2.3 SITE GEOLOGY
The Site surface is mapped as lower Oliogocene and upper Eocene age volcanic and
volcaniclastic rocks 1 . This unit consists of interbedded lapilli tuff, tuffaceous sandstone,
tuffaceous conglomerate, tuff, tuff breccia, mudstone, lava flows and intrusions2. These
geologic units are interpreted as pyroclastic, sedimentary, and volcanic rocks deposited
along a broad apron that was adjacent to the active Cascade Volcanoes2. Ash-flows,
mudflows, and sediment gravity flows (lahars) also cross cut the volcanic rocks. The
laplli tuffs and tuffaceous conglomerates are poorly sorted and matrix supported2. The
sandstone and tuffaceous sandstones are coarse to pebbly with local cross bedding2. In
the North and South Reserve areas approximately 90 to 100 feet of basalt overlie lithic
crystal tuffs and lithic tuffs.

Prior to construction of the lined cells at DCLF, several phases of site characterization
were conducted. Part of the characterization included the installation of a monitoring
well network around the landfill cells. Approximately 30 monitoring wells have been
drilled and installed around the DCLF. Several of these wells have been abandoned and
21 monitoring wells are currently in use for groundwater level measurement and water
quality analyses at DCLF. Surface geologic mapping and subsurface information from
the monitoring well logs have identified the following informal geologic units:

        x    Plagioclase-phyric basalt.
        x    Diamictites (debris flow deposits): tuff, tuffaceous siltstone, sandstone, and
             conglomerate; basalt dikes and flows.
        x    Welded lithic tuff, lithic lapilli tuff, and volcanic breccia.
        x    Aphyric and sparsely plagioclase phyric basalt.
        x    Tuffaceous sandstone, lapilli tuff, and lithic crystal tuff.

The bedrock units strike to the northwest and dip to the northeast. Individual dips for the
bedrock units range from 8 to 20 degrees. Minor sheer zones have been mapped in the
diamictites and basalts. An inactive fault that strikes roughly north-south along the
western margin of the valley containing Cell 1 was identified during site characterization
work. The fault consists of a series of shears that form a zone approximately 20 feet
wide.

The shear zone, or fault, strikes north 20 degrees west and dips steeply to the northeast.
The shears do not offset the overlying alluvium. The fault is interpreted to be a down-to-
the­east normal fault. Several secondary faults, which formed in response to the
displacement of the main fault, were mapped to the east of the main fault. A study of the
fault determined that the fault has not moved for approximately 31,500 ±3,000 years 2 .

Alluvium is locally present along the ephemeral stream drainages at the site. Alluvium,
where present, ranges in thickness from 0.5 feet to 10 feet. The alluvium extends
laterally from the drainages upslope where it merges with colluvium.

3.0 SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
Oregon Statewide Planning Goal 5 is implemented by Oregon Administrative Rules
(OAR), Division 23,. Criteria within this OAR must be met in order for the county to
recognize this Site as a significant site. Jackson County has adopted criteria in the Map
Designations Element of the Comprehensive Plan that are consistent with OAR 660-023-
0180(3)(a) and allow a site to be deemed significant and be placed upon the county's
inventory of significant aggregate and mineral resources. The significance criteria found
in the County's Map Designations Element for Aggregate Resource land is as follows:

3) Map Designation Criteria:

   A) Significance Determination. An aggregate resource site shall be considered
      significant if adequate information regarding the quantity, quality, and location of
      the resource is consistent with OAR 660-023-0180. The threshold for site
      significance is a quantity of more than 500,000 tons of aggregate material that
      meets applicable Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) specifications for
      base rock, unless the site is on farmland. Farmland sites are further qualified by
      the Rule (see 660-023-0180(4)). Smaller sized EFU sites (less than 500,000 tons)
      have no quality specification requirement. The following evidence will be
      submitted to demonstrate significance:

       i) A map and other written documentation sufficient to accurately identify the
          location and perimeter of the mineral or aggregate resource; and

       ii) Evidence that a representative set of samples meets applicable ODOT
           specifications for base rock for air degradation, abrasion and soundness. and

       iii) Information demonstrating the quantity of the resource deposit as determined
            by exploratory test data or other calculation compiled and attested to by a
            certified, licensed or registered geology professional, or other qualified
            person.

3.1 RESOURCE LOCATION
The Dry Creek Landfill property has been identified by SMR in the text, and on Figures 1
and Plate 1. The mining area is presented on Figure 2. The field investigations at the
Site for landfill characterization and the aggregate specific drilling conducted by KRC
confirm the presence of the crushed rock aggregate resource that underlies the Site. On-
site quarry operations for landfill and road construction have historically been conducted
at the Site. In addition active crushed rock mining and stockpiling is conducted along the
Dry Creek Landfill haul road to the north by KRC.

Abundant crushed rock aggregate has been located on the subject property. Based on the
geological review of the work conducted at the Site by an Oregon Registered Geologist,
an aggregate resource has been identified and is located within the proposed mining area
as shown on Figure 2 and Plate 1.

CONCLUSION: The aggregate resource at the Dry Creek Landfill property meets
the location criteria for a significant aggregate site under Map Designations criteria
3(A)(i).

3.2 RESOURCE QUALITY
Jackson County specifically states that the aggregate resource must meet ODOT
specifications for base rock. Aggregate samples that meet specified durability criteria are
accepted by ODOT for use as construction grade material. Most of the ODOT testing
requirements are based on standards developed by the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Several analytical methods are
ODOT standards. The samples from the Dry Creek Landfill quarry were collected by
Knife River and were submitted to the ODOT Materials Laboratory in Salem, Oregon.
The samples of fine ac aggregate, shoulder and aggregate base, and coarse ac aggregate
were submitted for nine standard analytical tests. A brief description of the ODOT and
ASHTO test methods is as follows:

The Standard Method of Test for Sieve Analysis of Fine and Coarse Aggregates
(T 27/11) determines the particle size distribution in fine and coarse aggregates by
sieving. Some specifications for aggregates that reference this method contain grading
requirements for both coarse and fine fractions.

The Standard Test Method for Specific Gravity and Absorption of Fine Aggregate
(T 84) determines the bulk and apparent specific gravity, and the absorption of fine
aggregate. This method, after soaking in water for 15 hours, determines the bulk specific
gravity and the apparent specific gravity, the bulk specific gravity on the basis of mass of
saturated surface-dry aggregate, and the absorption.

The Standard Test Method for Specific Gravity and Absorption of Coarse
Aggregate (T 85) determines the bulk and apparent specific gravity, and the absorption
of coarse aggregate. The specific gravity may be expressed as bulk specific gravity, bulk
specific gravity saturated surface dry (SSD) or apparent specific gravity.

The Standard Test Method for Determining the Liquid Limit of Soils (T 89) The
liquid limit of a soil is that water content, as determined in this procedure, at which a soil
passes from a plastic to a liquid state.

The Standard Test Method for Determining the Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index of
Soils (T 90) The plastic limit of a soil is the lowest water content determined in
accordance with this procedure at which the soil remains plastic.

The plasticity index of a soil is the range in water content expressed as a percentage of
the mass of the oven dried soil, within which the soil is in a plastic state. It is the
numerical difference between the liquid limit and plastic limit of the soil. The hand
rolling method will be the referee procedure.

The Los Angeles Rattler Abrasion Test (T 96) indicates how aggregate will withstand
grinding and general abrasion from sources such as traffic wear.



Agg Eval Rpt_rev 1.doc                  Page 7 of 11
The sample is weighed, subjected to tumbling in a small ball mill for a set time period,
screened and re weighed. The result reported is the percentage lost during the tumbling.

The Standard Method of Test for Soundness of Aggregate by Use of Sodium Sulfate
or Magnesium Sulfate (T 104) tests aggregate to determine its resistance to
disintegration by saturated solutions of sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate. This is
accomplished by repeated immersion in saturated solutions followed by oven drying to
partially or completely dehydrate the salt precipitated in permeable pore spaces. The
internal expansive force of the rehydration of the salt upon re-immersion simulates the
expansion of water upon freezing. This method provides information regarding the
soundness of aggregates to weathering action.

The Standard Method of Test for Lightweight Pieces in Aggregate (T 113) covers the
determination of the percentage of lightweight pieces in aggregate by means of sink-float
separation in a heavy liquid of appropriate specific gravity.

The Oregon Air Degradation Test (TM 208) measures the quantity and quality of the
material produced by attrition; similar to repeated loading and unloading from heavy
traffic. The quantity is indicated by a weight percentage of fine material produced and is
measured by a modified sand equivalent test. The test results are listed as a percentage of
original weight lost during testing and height of the fine particles produced by
degradation.

Four borings were advanced in the area of proposed mining during fall 2010. The
borings were advanced as coreholes and the rock core was logged in the field by an SMR
Oregon Registered Professional Geologist. Characteristics such as rock type, color, grain
size, mineralogy, fracturing, hardness, weathering, percent core recovery, changes in
drilling fluid color and recovery, penetration rates, and rock quality designation (RQD)
were measured and recorded. The RQD is an index of the degree of fracturing and is
defined by the total length of core pieces longer than four inches divided by the total
length of the core run and is expressed as a percentage. The rock core log information
from Dry Creek Landfill indicated competent bedrock with RQD measurements
consistently above 90 percent.

Based on the results of the ODOT laboratory analyses, all aggregate sampled from the
DCLF Site meets ODOT specifications for construction grade material. Copies of the
ODOT analytical reports are presented in Appendix A.

CONCLUSION: The crushed rock aggregate at the Dry Creek Landfill property
meets the ODOT criteria for aggregate quality as required by the Jackson County
Comprehensive Plan for Aggregate Resource Land.

3.3 RESOURCE QUANTITY
The Jackson County Comprehensive Plan states that for an aggregate site to be
determined significant, the resource must posses a minimum of 500,000 cubic tons of
mineable reserves. It is also stated within the counties plan that "it is the policy of the
county to protect a variety of large reserves to serve the regional market which also meet
ODOT specifications for construction grade material".


Agg Eval Rpt_rev 1.doc                 Page 8 of 11
A review of the KRC reports and Plate 1 indicates there is approximately 14,270,000 tons
of crushed rock aggregate reserve. The KRC exploratory drilling program was conducted
along section lines. The section lines and their reserve estimates in cubic yards and tons
are as follows:

    x Section 2: 55,710 square feet area, 567,417 cubic yards ­ 1,134,833 tons
    x Section 3: 93,925 square feet area, 1,217,546 cubic yards ­ 2,435,093 tons
    x Section 4: 94,575 square feet area, 1,138,403 cubic yards - 2,276,806 tons
    x Section 5: 78,250 square feet area, 941,898 cubic yards ­ 1,883,796 tons
    x Section 6: 59,185 square feet area, 548,009 cubic yards ­ 1,096,019 tons
    x Section 7: 61,185 square feet area, 623,181 cubic yards ­ 1,246,361 tons
    x Section 8: 81,400 square feet area, 1,055,185 cubic yards ­ 2,110,370 tons
    x Section 9: 51,550 square feet area, 811,435 cubic yards ­ 1,622,870 tons
    x Section 10: 16,550 square feet area, 229,861 cubic yards ­ 459,722 tons


TOTAL ESTIMATED RESERVE: 7,132,935 cubic yards or 14,270,000 tons

These estimates are approximate, and conservative, based on our geologic knowledge and
KRC subsurface exploration. The Dry Creek Landfill aggregate Site is an abundant
supply of reasonable quality that can be mined and available for the market.

CONCLUSION: It appears that there are approximately 14,270,000 tons of in place
aggregate resource estimated to occur at the Dry Creek Landfill property. This
estimated volume exceeds the Jackson County Comprehensive Plan quantity
criteria of 500,000 tons.

3.4 JACKSON COUNTY COMPRENSIVE PLAN
The Jackson County Comprehensive Plan (Plan or the Plan) identifies that aggregate is
the main product of mineral extraction in Jackson County. The primary aggregate
products are sand, gravel, and crushed rock. The Plan also notes that aggregate resources
are non-renewable and under continued use will become depleted. The first stated policy
in the Plan notes "The County shall protect significant mineral and aggregate resources
consistent with Statewide Planning Goal 5 and the process for complying with the Goal
specified in OAR Chapter 660, Division 23". The Goal 5 process is designed to
recognize the significance of aggregate resources when they are located within
conflicting resource zones.

The Plan states that per capita aggregate use has exceeded forecasts and projections
indicate there will continue to be a strong demand for aggregate. The Bear Creek Valley
consumes approximately 75 percent of the aggregate used in Jackson County. The Plan
documents that limited valley riverbed geological deposits and conflicting land uses in
those areas necessitates finding alternative supply locations in the future.



Agg Eval Rpt_rev 1.doc                Page 9 of 11
Further findings presented in the Plan comment that aggregate resources are bulky and
expensive to transport. As a result, the Plan notes the importance of developing future
aggregate resources within reasonable distances of each urban center and rural
communities in the county.

                           4.0 CONCLUSIONS
The Oregon Administrative Rules require an inventorying process for significant Goal 5
sites, as presented in OAR 660-23-0180 (3)(a). The criteria include the evaluation of the
location, quality, and quantity of the aggregate resource. Additionally, the Jackson
County Comprehensive Plan requires the evaluation of the location, quality consistent
with ODOT specifications, and a minimum mineable quantity of 500,000 tons of
resource.

It is SMR's professional opinion that this report provides adequate documentation to
demonstrate that the Dry Creek Landfill aggregate property meets the significance
criteria on the Jackson County Comprehensive Plan Map Designations Element that
implements OAR 660-023-0180 (3)(a) and meets the intent of the goals and policies
stated in the Jackson County Comprehensive Plan. The significance criteria are as
follows:

    x   The location of the Site, mining boundaries, and extent of the resource has been
        documented.
    x   The quality of the resource equals or exceeds ODOT specifications for
        construction grade material.
    x   The quantity of the resource exceeds the Jackson County minimum requirement
        of 500,000 tons.

Based on our historic knowledge of the Site, and the review of available data, it is our
professional opinion the Dry Creek Landfill aggregate Site is a Significant Aggregate
Resource Site and that the Jackson County aggregate inventory should be amended to
include this property.

 The State of Oregon and Jackson County use a 1,500-foot impact area from the mining area as the "standard mining impact area.
 However, this impact area can be modified where factual circumstances identify a potential for significant conflict beyond 1,500
 feet. The below table shows the use data behind Atlas Map 10 that is used in Section 3.1.2 to evaluate lands surrounding the
 standard impact area and in Section 3.1.3 to assess conflicts within the impact area..

 The conflicts analysis under the County's Division 23 program for Aggregate requires two steps. The first step is an analysis of
 potential conflicts to identify any actual conflicts. The second step is an analysis of identified conflicts to determine whether
 reasonable and practical measures can be implemented to minimize the conflicts. Actual conflicts must be identified on a
 property by property basis in three areas: existing and approved land uses, Goal 5 resources, and agricultural practices. The data
 provided in this section is the underlying property-by-property data, in combination with the related Atlas Page 10, used in the
 conflicts analysis. The data is the same as that for the entire inventory in Appendix C.1 above but it has been filtered to focus on
 the three areas where property by property analysis is required by the process.

Dry Creek Landfill & Aggregate ­ Zone Change & Comprehensive Plan Amendment                                                                          2
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. Approximately 679 acres of land in the vicinity of the existing Dry Creek Landfill are proposed
   for a change in zoning from Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) to Aggregate Removal (AR). The zone
   change will require an amendment to the Jackson County Comprehensive Plan. The purpose of
   the amendment is not to increase the intensity of the ongoing landfill use on the site. The change
   in zoning is proposed to allow an additional aggregate source to serve Jackson County.

2. The Dry Creek Landfill site currently generates significantly fewer peak hour trips than what
   was previously estimated in prior land-use approvals for the site. This is due primarily to the
   recent construction of a transfer station to serve public trips. Only employees and commercial
   traffic currently visit the landfill site.

3. Based on the expected aggregate production resulting from the proposed zone change, the site
   could generate an additional 35 trips during the evening peak hour and an additional 290
   weekday trips. An increase in waste disposal traffic will not occur as a result of the zone change.
   Rather, the increase in waste disposal will be a result of growth in the area, which would occur
   and be accommodated even without the proposed zone change.

4. The intersection of the Dry Creek Landfill haul road with Highway 140 presently operates
   acceptably and will continue to operate well within applicable performance standards with its
   current configuration throughout the planning horizon of year 2034. No capacity mitigations are
   recommended.

5. The existing weigh station immediately west of the haul road intersection with Highway 140
   poses potential operational and safety concerns with trucks exiting the weigh station and entering
   the haul road. This configuration has been in place for many years and there is no significant
   history of crashes that would indicate a safety problem. Still, the applicant is willing to mitigate
   by reconfiguring the weigh station exit to allow trucks to access the haul road without entering
   Highway 140 eastbound.

6. The proposed rezone will result in a minimal increase in trip generation, which can readily be
   accommodated by the existing transportation infrastructure serving the site. Traffic impacts to
   the west along Highway 140 are further reduced and will be insignificant. The proposed land
   use regulation amendment will not have a "significant affect" as defined by the Transportation
   Planning Rule.

INTRODUCTION


PROPERTY DESCRIPTION

Approximately 679 acres of land in the vicinity of the existing Dry Creek Landfill are proposed for a
change in zoning from Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) to Aggregate Removal (AR). The zone change
will require an amendment to the Jackson County Comprehensive Plan. While the applicant is Dry
Creek Landfill, Inc, the purpose of the amendment is not to increase the intensity of the ongoing
landfill use on the site. The change in zoning is proposed to be used as an additional aggregate
source to serve Jackson County. The general site location and the surrounding transportation system
are shown in Figure 1 on page six.

The site will take access via the existing private haul road that presently serves the existing Knife
River aggregate source as well as the Dry Creek Landfill. This haul road provides a direct
connection to Highway 140. Access to the site is also possible via Dry Creek Road, which connects
to Highway 140 via Antelope Road. However, all access to the area proposed for the AR zoning
district will take place via the haul road.


HIGHWAY 140 CORRIDOR PLAN

The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is presently conducting a planning study of the
Highway 140 corridor that includes the segment of highway near the site, and where the haul road
intersects the highway. The purpose of the planning study is to examine existing and long-term
conditions on the highway corridor and identify deficiencies and make recommendations for
improving safety and operations. Lancaster Engineering has been coordinating with ODOT to share
data and analysis from the corridor plan as it relates to the portion of the highway near the site.


PROJECT STUDY AREA

A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) scoping request was prepared on June 18, 2018 and sent to
representatives from Jackson County and ODOT. The scoping request memo is included in the
attached appendix. As a result of the memo, a meeting was convened with the applicant's
representatives as well as ODOT and Jackson County to discuss the appropriate scope of analysis for
the TIS. As a result of this meeting, the following elements are included in this TIS:

    ·    Traffic counts and full operational analysis at the intersection of the haul road with Highway
         140.
    ·    A comprehensive examination of trip generation for both the landfill operation and the
         planned aggregate source in light of the proposed zone change.
    ·    Examination of prior land-use approvals for the site and the trip generation assumed for
         these approvals.
    ·    Distribution and assignment of new trips generated by the site as a result of the zone change,
         including truck trips.

    ·    Analysis of the operation of the weigh station immediately west of the haul road intersection.
         Of particular concern is the close spacing between the weigh station exit and the haul road.
    ·    Examination of the Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) as it relates to the proposed zone
         change and Comprehensive Plan amendment.

Figure 1 on page six shows a vicinity map that includes the location of the site, the street network in
the project study area, and the existing configuration of the intersection of the haul road with
Highway 140.

SITE DEVELOPMENT & TRIP GENERATION

HISTORICAL USE OF DRY CREEK LANDFILL

The property that is subject to the proposed zone change and comprehensive plan amendment
surrounds the existing Dry Creek Landfill, which has been in place for many years. The property
will eventually be used for additional landfill area, although the current landfill site has adequate
capacity to serve the surrounding area for many years beyond the transportation planning horizon,
which is presently 2034. The proposed zone change is to establish an aggregate source on the site,
both to serve the landfill operation and also for the aggregate to be sold commercially.

In 1994, a Traffic Impact Analysis was performed to examine the impacts of expanded operations at
the landfill. The report examined forecast conditions in 1998 as well as 2015. The study showed
that in 1998 the site would generate a total of 270 daily weekday trips and 27 peak hour trips. By
2015, 395 daily trips were expected with 40 peak hour trips. The study showed that all of the
surrounding intersections would operate adequately and no mitigations were necessary.

At the time of that study, trips were made to the site from both commercial haulers as well as the
general public. Recently, Dry Creek Landfill, Inc. constructed a transfer station that now handles
trips from the general public as well as some commercial traffic. There is no longer public access to
the landfill site and the transfer station has reduced the amount of traffic to and from the site.

As explained in the section beginning on page 10 of this report, traffic counts were conducted on the
existing haul road that serves the site. Those traffic counts show that the landfill site currently
generates 350 daily weekday trips and 25 morning peak hour trips and 15 evening peak hour trips.
The table below offers a comparison of the previous estimates and current measurements.

                           AM Peak Hour        PM Peak Hour           Weekday
  1998 Estimated                -                   27                 270
  2015 Estimated                -                   40                 395

As shown in the table above, the site presently generates significantly fewer peak hour trips than
were estimated previously for year 1998 and 2015 conditions. Weekday volumes are still below
2015 estimates, but are more consistent with expected conditions. This is likely due to the transfer
station's removal of public trips to the landfill site. As shown later in this report, the site experiences
relatively consistent volumes throughout the day from commercial traffic.


TRIP GENERATION

Trip generation for the quarry that would result from the proposed zone change and comprehensive
plan amendment was derived based on typical quarry operations and the expected annual tonnage of


Dry Creek Landfill & Aggregate ­ Zone Change & Comprehensive Plan Amendment                              7
material to be removed from the site. The trip generation is primarily a product of rock trucks,
employee traffic, and visitors to the quarry. While the size of the aggregate operation is not known
with specificity at this time, a very large mining operation was assumed in order to assess a
reasonable worst-case analysis. The calculations are based on production of 750,000 tons of
aggregate being removed from the site per year. Our understanding is that this level of production is
more than 100,000 tons per year more than the existing Knife River quarry produced during the peak
of its operation. Further, the analysis assumes that all aggregate produced is removed from the site.
In reality, a portion of the aggregate will likely be used for the on-site land fill operation. For a
worst-case analysis, this internal use was not accounted for.

The table below shows a summary of the trip generation calculations. Because this study is prepared
for a comprehensive plan amendment and zone change, the analysis focuses on conditions at the
planning horizon. Traffic models and transportation planning efforts currently in process examine
evening peak hour conditions. As such, this exercise examines evening peak hour trip generation.
Detailed trip generation calculations are in the appendix to this report.

  Trip Generation Summary
                                   PM Peak Hour                   Weekday
                            Entering   Exiting  Total              Total

Although the subject site can ultimately be used as a landfill, this is not expected to occur within the
current 20-year planning horizon, since the existing landfill site has considerable excess capacity,
which will be sufficient to meet demands for many years. Regardless of this capacity, traffic
volumes from the landfill operation are directly related to the population served. That is, it takes
population growth in the area to increase waste and thereby increase traffic volumes at the landfill.
Trips would not increase simply because there is more land area available for use as a landfill.


TRIP DISTRIBUTION

During the evening peak hour, many of site trips will be employee traffic. Most of the aggregate
hauling operation occurs earlier in the day, so only a portion of the evening peak hour volumes are
attributable to rock trucks. The site trips were assigned to the surrounding transportation system
based primarily on existing traffic volumes and expected routes to and from the site.

Existing traffic volumes were considered both from the data collected at the haul road and from the
Highway 140 plan. Future baseline conditions (year 2034) were taken from the Highway 140 plan
directly and compared to existing volumes.

Figure 2 on page nine shows the distribution and assignment of site-generated traffic at the
intersections in the vicinity of the site.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS

TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Manual turning movement counts were conducted at the intersection of the haul road with Highway
140 from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM on Tuesday, May 15, 2012. The traffic count data is useful in
comparing the current operation of the site with prior analyses, as well as providing data to examine
the performance of the intersection of the haul road with Highway 140. Figure 3 on page 12 shows
the traffic volumes at the intersection during the morning and evening peak periods.

The following figure is a plot of traffic volume data by direction on Highway 140 as well as on the
haul road.

The figure above shows the distinct peaks in flow on the highway during typical commuter hours.
Note that for the haul road, traffic does not follow these traditional peaks and is relatively sustained
throughout the day. Haul road traffic diminishes in the afternoon and during the evening peak hour
of traffic on the highway, haul road traffic is minimal.




Dry Creek Landfill & Aggregate ­ Zone Change & Comprehensive Plan Amendment                            10
Future traffic volumes were taken and derived from the Highway 140 Corridor Plan. This plan is
being prepared under ODOT purview and the data and analysis complies with ODOT's Analysis
Procedures Manual. Therefore, it is appropriate for use in this TIS. The Highway 140 plan
examines long-term operation during the evening peak hour, as this is the design hour for the facility.
As such, this TIS also focuses on evening peak hour operations.

The Highway 140 plan examines conditions at the end of the planning horizon, which in this case is
the year 2034. To meet applicable approval criteria for the proposed zone change and
comprehensive plan amendment, this TIS must also analyze conditions at the end of the planning
horizon. For this analysis, through traffic volumes on Highway 140 during the evening peak hour
were taken directly from the Highway 140 plan.

Because the future growth in traffic volumes is a result of commensurate growth in households and
commercial development in the area, it was assumed that traffic volumes to and from the landfill on
the haul road would have similar growth patterns. That is, landfill traffic and activity can reasonably
be expected to grow with the surrounding population. The Highway 140 plan shows future growth
on the highway east of the Kershaw Road intersection at a rate of 1.39 percent per year. This annual
growth rate was applied to the existing 2012 traffic to and from the haul road to estimate year 2034
baseline conditions. Figure 4 on page 13 shows the 2034 baseline traffic volumes as well as the sum
of baseline volumes and additional site trips resulting from the proposed zone change and
comprehensive plan amendment.

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

To examine the operation of the intersection of the haul road with Highway 140, a capacity and level
of service analysis was conducted. The intersection is under the jurisdiction of ODOT, who uses the
volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio to measure intersection performance. Highway 140 is designated by
ODOT in the Oregon Highway Plan as a Statewide Highway, and east of Highway 62 it is also a
designated Freight Route. The segment of Highway 140 that is the subject of this analysis is outside
of the Rogue Valley Metropolitan Planning Organization, so the applicable v/c standard is 0.70 or
better.

Jackson County also uses v/c ratio as a performance standard, although the subject intersection is
under ODOT jurisdiction, so ODOT standards apply. The performance measures of average delay
per vehicle and level of service are also reported here, although strictly for informational purposes.


CAPACITY & LEVEL OF SERVICE

The results of the capacity analysis show that at the intersection of the haul road and Highway 140 is
currently operating with a favorable v/c ratio and level of service. Operation will degrade only
slightly by 2034, and with site trips resulting from the proposed zone change and comprehensive
plan amendment, the intersection will still operate well within the applicable performance standards.

The table below shows a summary of the results of the capacity and level of service analysis at the
study area intersection. Detailed capacity analysis calculations are included in the appendix to this
report.

WEIGH STATION OPERATION

There is a weigh station for eastbound traffic on Highway 140, located immediately to the west of
the haul road intersection. There is only about 80 feet between the end of the weigh station exit and
the start of the curve radius into the haul road. The scale is not in operation full-time, but only when
manned by ODOT Motor Carrier staff. During a recent site visit the scale was in operation and it
was observed that the majority of trucks stopping at the weigh station were bound for the landfill.
For landfill traffic, this short separation between the scale and the haul road poses a significant

Dry Creek Landfill & Aggregate ­ Zone Change & Comprehensive Plan Amendment                              14
operational concern, as trucks must briefly enter the eastbound through lane on Highway 140, then
immediately turn onto the haul road. The slow acceleration and deceleration characteristics of
loaded trucks further exacerbates the potential for conflicts with through traffic on the highway. The
photo below is taken from the haul road intersection, looking west at the weight station.




Looking west at the weigh station from the haul road intersection

To better evaluate the weigh station operation, a sample of usage data was obtained from ODOT.
The data is included in the attached appendix, but includes a date and time stamp for each truck that
crosses the scale. The data shows that the scale routinely processes between 19 and 22 trucks per
hour. The traffic count data for the intersection of the haul road and Highway 140 shows that there
are routinely between 12 and 18 trucks per hour making an eastbound left turn from the highway
onto the haul road. Based on this comparison, it is evident that as observed in the field, the majority
of trucks using the scale are bound for the haul road.

A detailed analysis of the crash history along Highway 140 is contained in the Highway 140 plan and
was reviewed to determine if there have been a significant number of crashes at this location. The
plan does not specifically analyze the haul road intersection, although it does report crashes along
Highway 140 between Kershaw Road and Riley Road. The crash history shows only three crashes in
this roadway segment in the five-year period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2009. Of
the three crashes, only two were of a type that could have been attributed to the haul road
intersection.

While the traffic volume data shows a significant number of trucks exiting the weigh station and
entering the haul road, the crash history does not appear to indicate a significant safety problem.
Still, as traffic volumes grow both on the haul road and on Highway 140, it is possible that this



Dry Creek Landfill & Aggregate ­ Zone Change & Comprehensive Plan Amendment                           15
movement may begin to compromise the safety of traffic on Highway 140. As such, an option for
mitigation was examined.

There is approximately 50 feet between the edge of the eastbound travel lane on Highway 140 and
the southern right-of-way line. This area presents a potential opportunity to reconfigure the weigh
station exit by providing a connection to the haul road without trucks first entering the eastbound
lane of Highway 140. The conceptual design below shows one possibility for this configuration.




Potential weigh station reconfiguration

The mitigation shown above would offer a significant improvement over the existing configuration,
as the conflict would only be between eastbound traffic entering the haul road from the highway and
eastbound traffic entering the haul road from the weigh station. Through traffic on Highway 140
would be removed from the conflict.

APPROVAL CRITERIA

TRANSPORTATION PLANNING RULE

Because a change in zoning and an amendment to the Jackson County comprehensive plan is
proposed, the Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) is applicable. The TPR ensures that adequate
transportation facilities will be available to serve the increase in traffic associated with the proposed
land use regulation amendment. A full response to the TPR and all other applicable approval criteria
are included in other application materials. However, the primary section of the TPR is quoted
below, with a response immediately following.

660-012-0060

Plan and Land Use Regulation Amendments
(1) If an amendment to a functional plan, an acknowledged comprehensive plan, or a land use
    regulation (including a zoning map) would significantly affect an existing or planned
    transportation facility, then the local government must put in place measures as provided in
    section (2) of this rule, unless the amendment is allowed under section (3), (9) or (10) of this
    rule. A plan or land use regulation amendment significantly affects a transportation facility if it
    would:
        (a) Change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility
            (exclusive of correction of map errors in an adopted plan);
        (b) Change standards implementing a functional classification system; or
        (c) Result in any of the effects listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this subsection based
            on projected conditions measured at the end of the planning period identified in the
            adopted TSP. As part of evaluating projected conditions, the amount of traffic projected
            to be generated within the area of the amendment may be reduced if the amendment
            includes an enforceable, ongoing requirement that would demonstrably limit traffic
            generation, including, but not limited to, transportation demand management. This
            reduction may diminish or completely eliminate the significant effect of the amendment.
              (A) Types or levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the functional
                    classification of an existing or planned transportation facility;
              (B) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility such
                    that it would not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or
                    comprehensive plan; or
              (C) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility that is
                    otherwise projected to not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or
                    comprehensive plan.
 
For the proposed change in zoning, the resulting potential increase in trip generation is small. The
capacity analysis in this report demonstrates that applicable performance standards will still be
readily satisfied, even with the proposed change in zoning and resulting increase in trip generation.
Traffic impacts to the west of the haul road intersection will be de minimis, as the additional trips are
very small, with the majority of trips added to through movements on the highway.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
The Dry Creek Landfill site currently generates significantly fewer peak hour trips than what was
previously estimated in prior land-use approvals for the site. This is due primarily to the recent
construction of a transfer station to serve public trips. Only employees and commercial traffic
currently visit the landfill site.

Based on the expected aggregate production resulting from the proposed zone change, the site could
generate an additional 35 trips during the evening peak hour and an additional 290 weekday trips.
An increase in waste disposal traffic will not occur as a result of the zone change. Rather, the
increase in waste disposal will be a result of growth in the area, which would occur and be
accommodated even without the proposed zone change.

The intersection of the Dry Creek Landfill haul road with Highway 140 presently operates
acceptably and will continue to operate well within applicable performance standards with its current
configuration throughout the planning horizon of year 2034. No capacity mitigations are
recommended.

The existing weigh station immediately west of the haul road intersection with Highway 140 poses
potential operational and safety concerns with trucks exiting the weigh station then entering the haul
road. This configuration has been in place for many years and there is no significant history of
crashes that would indicate a safety problem. Still, the applicant is willing to mitigate by
reconfiguring the weigh station exit to allow trucks to access the haul road without entering Highway
140 eastbound.

The proposed rezone will result in a minimal increase in trip generation, which can readily be
accommodated by the existing transportation infrastructure serving the site. Traffic impacts to the
west along Highway 140 are further reduced and will be insignificant. The proposed land use
regulation amendment will not have a "significant affect" as defined by the Transportation Planning
Rule.

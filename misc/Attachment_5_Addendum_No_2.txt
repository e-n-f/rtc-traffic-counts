     Addendum for proposed modifications to the Redwood City Costco Wholesale Project evaluated in
     an EIR certified in 2007 (referred to in this document as the 2007 FEIR). This Addendum No. 2 to
     the 2007 FEIR has been prepared pursuant to Section 15164 (Addendum to an EIR or Negative
     Declaration) of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).



Need for Addendum
     In 2005, Costco Wholesale (Costco) submitted an application to demolish the existing Redwood City
     Costco Wholesale Center and construct a larger facility (including a sales warehouse and tire
     sales/installation center), a new parking lot configuration, and a 16-station fueling center. As part of
     the City’s consideration of the project, a Draft EIR was prepared which included traffic, air quality,
     and economic impact analyses for the expansion of the facility including a new four island, 16-
     station fueling center. After environmental review and public comment, on June 19, 2007 the
     Planning Commission certified a Final EIR with 16 fueling stations, and the Redwood City Zoning
     Administrator approved the project with 12 fueling stations. The project was appealed to the City
     Council on June 26, 2007 by members of the Redwood Village Neighborhood Association. An
     Addendum (Addendum No. 1) was prepared on August 8, 2007 to address an omission from the
     technical appendices in the 2007 Final EIR. On August 13, 2007 the City Council conducted an appeal
     hearing, following which it upheld the Planning Commission’s certification of the Final EIR and the
     Zoning Administrator’s approval of the project. The new Redwood City Costco Wholesale and Tire
     Center and onsite fueling center (Costco warehouse and fueling center) opened in 2009 with a three
     island, 12-station fueling center.

     Over the last few years, Redwood City Costco management has observed long wait times, impacts on
     onsite vehicle circulation, and obstructed access to parking from cars waiting in line at the fueling
     center. As a result, Costco has concluded that the 12 stations are not efficiently meeting customer
     demand. In response to this observation, Costco has submitted an application to the City to expand
     the existing fueling center by adding two additional islands and eight additional stations, for a total
     of five fueling islands and 20 fueling stations. The proposed modifications would involve the
     reconfiguration of the existing parking lot and onsite vehicle circulation, as well as modifications to
     the existing landscaping. The total number of parking spaces after the parking lot reconfiguration
     would increase from 745 to 747 parking spaces by converting some “Costco-sized” stalls to standard
     size. Costco anticipates the proposed modifications to the fueling center will result in shorter lines,
     reduced idling times, and improved onsite traffic circulation.

CEQA Requirements for Use of an Addendum
     The City has determined that preparation of an Addendum to the EIR pursuant to Section 15164 of
     the CEQA Guidelines is the most appropriate method for including the correct technical Attachments
     to Appendix D of the Draft EIR. Section 15164(a) of the CEQA Guidelines states:
          [t]he lead agency or responsible agency shall prepare an addendum to a previously certified EIR
          if some changes or additions are necessary but none of the conditions described in Section
          15162 [of the CEQA Guidelines] calling for preparation for a subsequent EIR have occurred.
     Section 15162(a) of the CEQA Guidelines states:
               (a) When an EIR has been certified or a negative declaration adopted for a project, no
               subsequent EIR shall be prepared for that project unless the lead agency determines, on the basis
               of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record, one or more of the following:
                    (1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the
                    previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant
                    environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
                    significant effects;
                    (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is
                    undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration
                    due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in
                    the severity of previously identified significant effects; or
                    (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have
                    been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was
                    certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted, shows any of the following:
                         (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous
                         EIR or negative declaration;
                         (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown
                         in the previous EIR;
                         (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact
                         be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project,
                         but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or
                         (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those
                         analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects
                         on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure
                         or alternative.

     None of the criteria set forth in the CEQA Guidelines cited above have been triggered by the
     inclusion of this information; therefore, it is the City‘s determination that an Addendum to the EIR
     for the previously approved project is the appropriate CEQA document for the proposed
     modifications. The proposed modifications do not trigger the need for a Supplemental or
     Subsequent EIR under Section 15162 of the CEQA Guidelines because the proposed modifications
     would not result in the identification of new significant environmental impacts nor substantially
     increase the severity of previously identified significant environmental impacts. This Addendum No.
     2 provides an analysis of the proposed modifications, and does not result in any new conclusions
     about project impacts or mitigation measures.

Circulation and Planning Commission Consideration of
Addendum
     Under Section 15164(c) of the CEQA Guidelines, an Addendum does not need to be circulated for
     public review. The decision-making body (i.e., Planning Commission) is required to consider this
     Addendum No. 2 along with the 2007 Final EIR prior to making a new decision on the project (CEQA
     Guidelines Section 15164[d]). This Addendum No. 2 has been posted to the City‘s website
     (www.redwoodcity.org) and has been made available at the Redwood City Planning Division, 1017
     Middlefield Road, Redwood City, CA 94064.



Incorporation by Reference
     In compliance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15150, this Addendum No. 2 has incorporated by
     reference the 2007 FEIR (SCH#: 2005092047), several technical studies, analyses, and reports that
     were prepared as part of the 2007 FEIR, and several new technical studies and reports that were
     prepared in 2011 and 2012 for the proposed modifications. Information from documents
     incorporated by reference into this Addendum No. 2 have been briefly summarized in the
     appropriate section(s) which follow, and the relationship between the incorporated part of the
     referenced document and this Addendum No. 2 has been described. The documents and other
     sources which have been used in the preparation of this Addendum No. 2 are identified in Chapter 9,
     References.



Methodology
     The environmental analysis contained in this Addendum No. 2 has been developed to adequately
     address the environmental issues associated with the proposed modifications described in Chapter
     3, in consideration of new information and changed conditions since the certification of the 2007
     FEIR. This format is consistent with the format of the 2007 FEIR, presented below, with a brief
     discussion of the information included within each topic.


Environmental Setting
     The environmental setting of the project site remains substantially the same as it existed at the time
     of publication of the NOP for the Draft EIR in 2006. The most substantial change to the
     environmental setting relates to the opening on the project site of the Costco Warehouse and Tire
     Station with a 12-station fueling center in 2009. However, some conditions external to the project
     site, such as traffic levels, are different than in 2006. A detailed description of the changes in the
     environmental setting since the certification of the 2007 FEIR, including applicable plans and
     policies, is included in Chapter 2.


Thresholds of Significance
     Consistent with the 2007 FEIR, significance criteria used in the analysis in Chapter 4, Environmental
     Impact Analysis, are derived from Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines. In addition, City policies,

Redwood City                                                                                Chapter 1. Introduction


     standards and thresholds adopted by other public agencies with jurisdiction over select
     environmental issues are used as thresholds of significance. Also, accepted technical and scientific
     data are used in other instances to determine if an impact would be considered significant. In cases
     where the Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, adopted City policies, standards or thresholds have
     changed since the certification of the 2007 FEIR, the new threshold has been included in this
     Addendum No. 2.

     For the analysis of the environmental impacts in this Addendum No. 2, significance criteria from the
     CEQA Guidelines are identified and have been applied in analyzing the potential effects of the
     proposed modifications.


Environmental Impacts
     Consistent with the 2007 FEIR, the analysis of environmental impacts presented in this Addendum
     No. 2 identifies specific project-related direct and indirect, short term and long term, and
     unavoidable impacts of the proposed modifications. As described above, the significance criteria
     provide the basis for distinguishing between impacts which are determined to be significant (i.e.,
     impacts which exceed the threshold of significance) and impacts which are considered less than
     significant. The existing environmental setting (i.e., existing conditions) at the time of NOP
     publication for the 2006 Draft EIR is used as the baseline for documenting the nature and extent of
     changes to the environment or the environmental impacts anticipated to result from the proposed
     modifications; however, changes in physical conditions that have occurred from 2006 to 2012 are
     taken into account, particularly in the analysis of traffic, air quality, and noise.

     The following terminology is used to describe the level of significance of potential impacts.
         A finding of no impact is appropriate if the analysis concludes that the project would not affect
          the particular topic area in any way.
         An impact is considered less than significant if the analysis concludes that it would cause no
          substantial adverse change to the environment and requires no mitigation.
         An impact is considered less than significant with mitigation incorporated if the analysis
          concludes that it would cause no substantial adverse change to the environment with the
          implementation of the mitigation measures described herein.
         An impact is considered potentially significant if the analysis concludes that it could have a
          substantial adverse effect on the environment. For the proposed modifications, no impacts were
          determined to be potentially significant.
     The proposed mitigation measures included in this Addendum No. 2 are designed to reduce or
     eliminate the potentially significant environmental impacts described herein. Mitigation measures
     are structured in accordance with the criteria in Sections 15126.4 and 15370 of the State CEQA
     Guidelines. Unavoidable significant adverse impacts are those effects that either cannot be mitigated
     or that remain significant even after implementation of mitigation measures. The level of
     significance of the identified impacts after mitigation is identified in Chapter 4, Environmental
     Impact Analysis, of this Addendum No. 2.

Overview
     The proposed modifications consist of expanding the existing Costco fueling center from three
     islands with 12 fueling stations to five islands with 20 fueling stations. Since it opened in 2009,
     Costco has observed long wait times, onsite vehicle circulation issues, and obstructed access to
     parking from cars waiting in line at the fueling center. As a result, Costco has concluded that the 12
     fueling stations, or pumps, are not efficiently meeting customer demand. The proposed
     modifications to the fueling center require environmental review, a modification to the existing Use
     Permit, an Architectural Permit, and a Sign Permit.



Location
     The Costco warehouse and fueling center are located at 2300 Middlefield Road in Redwood City,
     California. Surrounding uses include Orchard Supply Hardware to the west, Safe Keep Storage to the
     east, Caltrain/Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) railroad tracks to the south. Sigona’s Market and single
     and multi-family residential uses are located north and northeast of the project site across
     Middlefield Road. Access to the existing fuel facility is from an existing signalized intersection at
     Middlefield Road and Willow Street. Vehicles enter the fueling center from an internal access drive
     providing access to both the warehouse and fueling center. Fuel delivery trucks utilize the same
     access drive and internal circulation. Figure 3-1 depicts the general project location.



Site Background
     Over the last few years, Redwood City Costco management has observed long wait times, impacts on
     onsite vehicle circulation, and obstructed access to parking from cars waiting in line at the fueling
     center. As a result, Costco has concluded that the 12 fueling stations are not efficiently meeting
     customer demand. In response to this observation, Costco has submitted an application to the City to
     expand the existing fueling center from three fueling islands and 12 fueling stations by adding two
     additional islands and eight additional stations, for a total of five fueling islands and 20 fueling
     stations. The proposed modifications would involve the reconfiguration of the existing parking lot
     and onsite vehicle circulation, as well as modifications to the existing landscaping. The total number
     of parking spaces after the parking lot reconfiguration would increase from 745 to 747 parking
     spaces by converting some “Costco-sized” stalls to standard size. Costco anticipates the proposed
     modifications to the fueling center will result in shorter lines, reduced idling times, and improved
     onsite traffic circulation.

Existing Setting
     The project site includes the 13.65 acre property with the 160,620 square foot (sf) Costco
     Warehouse and Tire Station, the 12 station fueling center and 745 existing parking stalls. The
     proposed modifications described in this Addendum No. 2 would be located entirely within the
     project site as described in the 2007 FEIR. The project site has a zoning designation of Industrial
     Restricted (IR) and a General Plan designation of Commercial–Regional. Fueling centers are
     permitted in the IR Zone subject to approval of a Use Permit (UP). A UP (UP2005-05) was approved
     in 2007 for the existing 12-station fueling center based on certification of the 2007 FEIR.

     In order to consider the whole of the project as would be revised with this Addendum No. 2, the
     analysis in this document considers both the existing condition as of the writing of this document
     (Summer 2012) as well as those that existed at the time the NOP was issued in 2006 for the Draft
     EIR.



Applicable Plans and Polices
     As described in the 2007 FEIR, a number of local and regional plans and policies regulate
     development on the project site. Changes to these plans and policies since the certification of the
     2007 FEIR are summarized below.


City of Redwood City General Plan
     The City of Redwood City new General Plan was approved by the City Council of Redwood City on
     October 11, 2010. The new General Plan is a comprehensive and long-range guide to the physical
     development of Redwood City and also provides guidance regarding lands outside City boundaries
     that have relationship to the City’s planning activities. Goals, policies and programs are outlined in
     the new General Plan to guide the overall growth, change and governance in Redwood City.

     The 1991 General Plan designated the eastern portion of the project site (east of Charter Street
     where the warehouse is currently located) as Light Industrial and the western portion of the project
     site (west of Charter street, where the proposed modifications to the fueling center would occur) as
     Heavy Commercial/Office. The Light Industrial land use designation allowed the development of low
     density, clean industrial operations and was mostly associated with industrial parks or industrial
     estates predominately engaged in warehousing, research and development. The Heavy
     Commercial/Office land use designation allowed the development of multi-story retail and office
     uses.

     The New General Plan designates the project site as Commercial-Regional. The Commercial‐Regional
     category provides opportunities for general retail, commercial services, restaurants, lodging, vehicle
     sales and service, commercial recreation, professional offices, medical and financial institutions, and

     The objectives of the project described in the 2007 FEIR have not changed. This chapter describes
     the proposed modifications to the fueling center that were approved with certification of the 2007
     FEIR. All other components of the project described in the 2007 FEIR have not changed.



Proposed Modifications
     The proposed modifications consist of expanding the existing Costco fueling center from three
     islands and 12 fueling stations to five islands and 20 fueling stations. The additional fueling stations
     are proposed along the north side of the existing fueling center. The proposed modifications include
     the extension of the existing concrete slab by 56 feet and the existing canopy by 64 feet to cover the
     additional islands. Onsite circulation would be modified to provide improved egress from the fueling
     center to parking.

     The existing fueling center currently employs one supervisor, three full time employees, and two
     “float” employees who cover breaks. No new employees would be required for the proposed
     modifications to the fueling center.


Parking and Circulation
     The proposed modifications would include reconfiguring the existing parking and vehicle circulation
     adjacent to the existing fueling center. Fifteen parking spaces adjacent to the existing facility and a
     landscape planter would be removed to accommodate the additional islands. To improve onsite
     circulation, a new drive aisle would be created by removing six spaces within a double row of
     parking on the east side of the fueling center. Two new end island landscape planters would be
     constructed as part of the new driveway aisle. A portion of the double row of parking adjacent to the
     facility would be angled at 52.5 degrees with a 15-foot one-way drive aisle to accommodate the
     additional fueling stations and improve onsite circulation. As part of the proposed modifications, a
     total of 21 existing parking spaces would be relocated onsite so that the overall parking count for
     the warehouse would not be reduced. In order to accommodate the relocation of these 21 parking
     spaces, 260 oversized existing parking spaces measuring 10 feet wide would be restriped to a width
     of 9 feet. The Site Plan (see Figure 3-2) depicts the location of the parking spaces that would be
     restriped to accommodate replacement parking.

     The existing parking for the warehouse includes 459 10-foot-wide stalls, 270 9-foot-wide stalls, and
     16 handicapped parking spaces, for a total of 745 spaces. The proposed modifications would provide
     191 10-foot-wide stalls, 540 9-foot-wide stalls, and 16 handicapped parking spaces for a total of 747
     spaces.


Landscaping
     The landscaping considered as part of the certification of the 2007 FEIR included a 1,178 sf planter
     located adjacent to the fueling center, which along with other landscape islands throughout the

Redwood City                                                                           Chapter 3. Project Description


     project site represented a total of 8 percent of the total project site. During the Zoning
     Administrator’s hearing, the four island, 16-fuel station was approved with a reduced number of
     islands and fuel stations with three islands and 12 fuel stations and, as a result, the planter increased
     in size to 6,316 sf and the overall landscape coverage increased to 9 percent. The proposed
     modifications would require the removal of the existing landscape planter adjacent to the fueling
     center. Four existing landscape islands within the parking field would be expanded by a total of
     1,312 sf to replace some of the existing landscaping being removed for a net loss of approximately
     5,004 sf, and would result in 8 percent of the total project site being landscaped. The landscape
     islands would be planted with similar species of trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Replacement
     landscaping would consist of 24-inch box trees, 15-gallon shrubs, and 1-gallon ground cover, with
     redwood mulch to match the existing landscaping. There are 271 existing trees on the project site.
     Approximately 16 trees would be removed for the proposed modifications and seven new 24-inch
     box trees would be planted for a total of 262 trees. The required number of trees (one tree per five
     stalls) is 150; the proposed modifications would exceed that number by 112 trees.


Grading
     The existing landscape island adjacent to the fueling center provided for a sloped transition from the
     existing parking field to the fueling center, an approximate 20-inch difference in elevation. With the
     removal of the landscape island, a 20-inch poured-in-place retaining wall with 4-foot bollards would
     be constructed to make up the grade differential and provide additional safety to warehouse
     members.


Canopy Design
     The existing 32-foot wide, 88-foot long canopy over the fueling center would be extended by 64 feet
     for a total of 152 feet. The canopy’s width would be maintained. The existing approximately 14-foot
     6-inch minimum clearance and overall canopy height of 17-feet 6 inches would also be maintained.
     The extended canopy would be constructed with similar materials as the original approved canopy
     design.


Signage
     The fueling center currently has illuminated Costco Gasoline signs on each of the four sides of the
     existing canopy. The existing signage would be replaced with new signage that would have a slightly
     modified design. Each sign would be approximately 6 sf smaller than the existing signs. The new
     signage would be installed and centered on the fascia of the expanded canopy. The signage would
     consist of externally illuminated panels consistent with the originally approved signage.

Construction
     Construction of the proposed modifications is anticipated to begin in April 2013 and would last
     approximately seven weeks. As shown in Table 3-1, construction activities would include two main
     phases: demolition and site preparation followed by construction of the fuel system, paving, and
     canopy work. Some activities within Phase 2 would overlap with each other. The estimated number
     of workers on the site would vary during construction, but the maximum number of workers on the
     site at any given time would be 15.

     Construction of the proposed modifications to the fueling center would require excavation of soils.
     Excavation would extend to a depth no greater than 2 feet below the existing grade of the site and
     would result in approximately 200 cubic yards (cy) of excavated soils. Soil and surface material
     would be segregated. Surface material (demolished asphalt and concrete curbing) would be
     exported to the appropriate landfill location that can accept this type of demolished material.
     Excavated soil would be stockpiled on the project site until it is re-used in the backfill process or it is
     determined it is no longer needed. The soil stockpile would be contained within the site construction
     fencing, and may be exported immediately if it is deemed by either the jurisdiction or design
     engineer as unsuitable for re-use as backfill. Likely potential soil disposal sites are located in San
     Jose (Mulvanny G2 2012).

     Several different pieces of construction equipment would be used during each phase for demolition
     and construction. Table 3-2 identifies the type and number of equipment by phase.

     The site of the proposed modifications would be fenced during construction, with access limited to
     construction personnel and other authorized personnel only. All construction staging would occur
     on the project site. Nighttime lighting on the site during construction would be limited, providing
     only lighting necessary for safety and security. Consistent with the City’s Noise Ordinance
     (Municipal Code Section 24.32), construction activity would be limited to between 7:00 a.m. and
     3:30 p.m. on weekdays.1 No construction is proposed on Saturdays, Sundays, or federal holidays.


Discretionary Approvals Required
     The following discretionary actions from the City of Redwood City would be required to implement
     the proposed modifications.
         Approval of Modifications to the Existing Use Permit.
         Approval of an Architectural Permit.
         Approval of a Sign Permit.




1 The City’s NoiseOrdinance permits construction activities between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 pm, however
the project applicant has confirmed that construction activities would cease at 3:30 p.m. each day.

Land Use, Planning, and Zoning
Impact Discussion
     The regulatory environment and existing conditions related to land use, planning, and zoning
     remain the same as described in the 2007 FEIR. The regional plans described in Section 4.2 in the
     2007 FEIR (page 4.2-7) have not changed with the exception of the 2010 Clean Air Plan which is
     described in Section 4.4, Air Quality, of this Addendum No. 2.

     As discussed below, the proposed modifications to the project would not result in any new or more
     severe significant land use, planning, or zoning impacts beyond those previously addressed in the
     2007 FEIR and 2007 Addendum No. 1, and there are no other changes in circumstances, or new
     information that would necessitate any major modification of the land use, planning, and zoning
     discussions in the 2007 FEIR and 2007 Addendum No. 1.

Would the project:

a. Physically divide an established community?

     No New Impact. The proposed modifications would involve the construction of two additional
     fueling islands on the north side of the existing fueling center and the reconfiguration of existing
     parking and circulation. The existing fueling center was built in 2009 and is located within a highly
     urbanized mixed use area. The proposed modifications would be consistent with existing and
     planned land uses in the project vicinity. Because the project site is located within the existing
     boundary of the Costco parking lot, the proposed modifications would not physically divide an
     established community. No new impact would occur.




Addendum No. 2 to the Environmental Impact Report for                                                  September 2012

Redwood City                                                                 Chapter 4. Environmental Impact Analysis


b. Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction
   over the project (including, but not limited to, a general plan, specific plan, local coastal
   program, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
   environmental effect?

     No New Impact. The project site is located in the City of Redwood City and is subject to the
     Redwood City General Plan and other related Redwood City planning documents. According to the
     Redwood City General Plan Land Use Map, the project site is designated as Commercial-Regional.
     The Commercial-Regional land use designation allows the development of general retail,
     commercial services, restaurants, lodging, vehicle sales and service, commercial recreation,
     professional offices, medical and financial institutions, and other similar business activities.

     According to the Redwood City Official Zoning Map, the project site is zoned as IR. As stated in
     Article 17 of the Redwood City Zoning Code, it is the purpose of the IR zoning district “to promote
     viable industrial areas by providing a district for the location of selected industries, wholesale
     establishments, specified retail establishments, and heavy commercial uses which can congregate
     together…” Permitted uses within the IR zoning district include research facilities, manufacturing,
     assembly, repair operations, and warehouses. Fueling centers are permitted in the IR zone subject to
     approval of a UP. A UP was approved in 2007 for the 12-station fueling center. The proposed
     modifications would require a modification to the existing UP to allow for a 20-station fueling
     center.

     The proposed modifications would be a continuation of an existing use and do not involve any new
     land uses. The proposed modifications are permitted under the aforementioned land use
     designation and within the IR zoning designation with approval of a UP. Therefore, the proposed
     modifications would not conflict with Redwood City General Plan policies and the zoning
     designation of the project site. No new impact would occur.

c.   Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation
     plan?

     No New Impact. The project site consists of a fueling center on an existing parking lot within a fully
     developed urban area. There are no existing or proposed HCPs or NCCPs within the vicinity of the
     project area. As a result, no new impacts related to HCPs and NCCPs would occur.

     character or quality of the site and its
     surroundings?

     glare that would adversely affect daytime or
     nighttime views in the area?



Aesthetics
Impact Discussion
     The regulatory environment and existing conditions related to aesthetic resources remain the same
     as described in the 2007 FEIR. The new General Plan includes the following new policies and
     programs that are applicable to the proposed modifications:

          Policy BE‐1.8: Require that new projects are integrated as seamlessly as possible into
          surrounding development, creating extensions of the urban fabric.

          Policy BE‐1.9: Carefully consider new shade, shadow, light, and glare effects from proposed
          development projects and comprehensive plans.

          Policy BE‐19.8: Require that new and renovated industrial properties and structures exhibit
          quality design and continued to be maintained.

          Program BE‐15: Title 24 Lighting Zone. Require all new development and redevelopment
          within Redwood City to be in compliance with Title 24 Lighting Zone (LZ‐3) requirements.
          Encourage the use of low mounted, downward casting exterior lighting for all new development
          in the city, so as to reduce light trespass onto adjacent properties. Further, require new
          developments to submit lighting and photometric site plans for City review and approval prior
          to the issuance of individual building permits.

     As discussed below, with implementation of the standard conditions identified in the 2007 FEIR, the
     proposed modifications to the project would not result in any new or more severe significant
     aesthetic impacts beyond those previously addressed in the 2007 FEIR and 2007 Addendum No. 1,
     and there are no other changes in circumstances, or new information that would necessitate any
     major modification of the aesthetic resources discussions in the 2007 FEIR and 2007 Addendum No.

Would the project:

a. Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?

     No New Impact. According to the Redwood City General Plan and General Plan EIR, scenic vistas are
     primarily available from the southern and western portions of the City within the elevated hillside
     neighborhoods, including views from the Edgewood County Park, Easter Cross, Cañada College, and
     Easter Bowl. These areas, because of their elevated locations, provide opportunities for scenic views
     of the nearby Peninsula communities and San Francisco Bay to the east-northeast. As described in
     the 2007 FEIR (page 4.3-1), views from the project site facing north, east, and west are of an existing
     surface parking lot and landscaped areas in the foreground and commercial buildings, Middlefield
     Road and multifamily residences in the background. Current views of the project site from
     Middlefield Road include a surface parking lot in the foreground with security light poles and
     scattered trees in the landscaped medians as well as the Costco warehouse and fueling center
     building. There are views of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. These physical conditions and
     viewscapes remain the same in 2012 as they existed in 2006. From the viewpoint of Middlefield
     Road and multifamily residences, the only physical change to the project site since 2006 has been
     the addition of the fueling center canopy, which can be seen in the background. Due to the distance,
     intervening topography, and buildings, and because the expanded canopy associated with the
     proposed modifications would be the same height as the existing canopy, the impact of the proposed
     modifications would be the same as that which was analyzed in the 2007 FEIR (see page 4.3-3) and
     would not have an adverse effect on a scenic vista. There would be no new impact.

b. Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to trees, rock outcroppings,
   and historic buildings along a scenic highway?

     No New Impact. According to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) State Scenic
     Highway Mapping System, there are three designated scenic highways within the San Mateo County
     (County), one of which is located less than 4 miles from the project site. Interstate 280 (I-280),
     which runs southeast to northwest approximately 3.3 miles southwest of the project site, is a
     designated scenic highway from the Santa Clara County line to the San Bruno city limit. I-280
     traverses the valley created by the San Andreas Fault and provides forest and mountain vistas,
     background water and mountain panoramas, and enclosed lake and mountain ridge views (Caltrans
     2007). Because I-280 is situated within a densely vegetated and enclosed valley, views of the
     proposed modifications would be unavailable. Existing mature trees and vegetation and well as
     topographic features would completely block views of the project site from this scenic highway.
     Furthermore, the proposed modifications are not located along a scenic highway, would not have
     any effect on the physical environment along a scenic highway, and would not remove or otherwise
     affect large rock outcroppings, protected tree species, historic buildings, or any other scenic
     resources. Therefore, there would be no new impact.

c.   Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings?

     No New Impact. The project site is currently developed with a 160,620 sf commercial retail
     warehouse building, a surface parking consisting of 745 parking stalls, and a fueling center with
     three islands and 12 fueling stations. The surrounding visual character of the project site is
     characterized by commercial uses and single- and multifamily residences. The adjacent land uses
     include Orchard Supply Hardware to the west, Safe Keep Storage to the east, Caltrain/UPRR railroad
     tracks to the south, and a Sigona’s Market to the north. No changes to the existing Costco warehouse
     are proposed, and the proposed modifications are limited to the reconfiguration of the existing

                                                        4-6                                               ICF 00154.12
the Redwood City Costco Wholesale Project
Redwood City                                                                   Chapter 4. Environmental Impact Analysis


     parking spaces and internal circulation to accommodate a five-island fueling center with 20 fueling
     stations. This would require the removal of approximately 6,316 sf of existing ornamental
     landscaping, and the installation of approximately 1,312 sf of replacement landscaping that would
     be consistent with the existing landscaping onsite. The existing fueling center has an 88-foot canopy.
     The proposed modifications would include a 64-foot extension to the north side of the existing
     canopy and two new fueling islands, each with four fueling stations. The proposed modifications
     would be designed to be consistent with the existing fueling center.

     The visual character of the project site would not change because the proposed modifications to the
     fueling center and landscaping would be similar in visual character and function to the existing
     facility. As such, because the proposed modifications would be consistent with the visual character
     of the existing facilities, it would not degrade the existing visual character or aesthetic quality of the
     project site and its surroundings. There would be no new impact.

d. Create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect daytime or
   nighttime views in the area?

     Less-than-Significant New Impact. Nighttime lighting on the project site during construction
     would be limited, providing only lighting necessary for safety and security. Consistent with the City’s
     Noise Ordinance, construction activity would be limited to between 7:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. on
     weekdays. Nighttime lighting on the project site during construction would be temporary, occurring
     only during the construction period, and such lighting would be limited to that necessary for safety
     and security. Therefore, the proposed modifications would not create a new source of substantial
     lighting that would affect nighttime views in the area during construction.

     The proposed modifications would have new light installations in the expanded part of the canopy
     which would be directed at each of the new fueling stations. The proposed modifications would also
     relocate the four existing illuminated canopy signs to the center of each side the expanded canopy
     and would reduce the size of each sign by approximately 6 sf. The new signage would be consistent
     with the originally approved signage, and would continue to be consistent with the existing
     character of the project site in compliance with Policies BE-1.8 and BE-19.8 in the General Plan.

     According to the City‘s Zoning Code, Article 35.4 Service Stations, lighting facilities shall be designed,
     controlled, and maintained so that no light source on the property shall be of such high intensity as
     to cause a traffic hazard and so that no direct light source is visible from any location not on the site.
     No such facility shall be higher than 20 feet above finished grade. Lighting associated with the
     fueling center would be designed to focus illumination immediately within the fueling area and
     blend in with parking lot lighting 20 to 30 feet from the fueling center canopy. As described in
     Standard Condition 4.3-1, (Standard Condition 4.3-1 of the 2007 FEIR [page 4.3-4]), lighting plans
     for the proposed modifications would require review by the City to ensure that no lighting spillover
     into adjacent properties, especially residential uses, occurs. The lighting plans would be compliant
     with Policy BE-1.9 and Program BE-15 in the General Plan, which would be ensured through review
     by the City. Compliance with applicable design standards would prevent significant adverse impacts
     regarding light and glare. Therefore, new impacts related to lighting and glare would be less than
     significant.

          Standard Condition 4.3-1 (2007 FEIR Standard Condition 4.3-1): Implementation of the
          proposed modifications shall be subject to site plan and design review for compliance with the
          City‘s design guidelines and other applicable development standards to ensure that no

               is unsignalized, then additional
               traffic volumes must meet the
               Caltrans peak hour volume warrant
               for traffic signal installation
          Causes an unsignalized intersection
               currently operating at LOS D or
               better to degrade to LOE E, and
               either: 1) increases the delay by 5
               seconds or more, or 2) traffic
               volumes exceed the Caltrans peak
               hour traffic signal warrant criteria.
     For local residential roadway segments, a
     significant traffic impact would occur if:
          The roadway segment currently
              carries less than 3,000 vehicles per
              day; and
          There is an increase in traffic volume
              of more than 5 percent of the daily
              or peak hour traffic. The absolute
              minimum threshold is an increase of
              5 peak hour trip of 50 daily trips for
              low volume roadways.
 b. Exceed, either individually or cumulatively, a
     level of service standard established by the
     county congestion management agency for
     designated roads or highways?
 c.  Substantially increase hazards because of a
     design feature (e.g., sharp curves or
     dangerous intersections) or incompatible
     uses (e.g., farm equipment)?

Traffic, Circulation and Access
      The transportation and traffic impacts related to the proposed modifications were evaluated based
      on the traffic studies prepared by Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (Kittelson & Associates, Inc. 2012a,
      2012b) and the transportation impact analysis contained in the 2007 FEIR and 2007 Addendum No.
      1 for the Redwood City Costco Wholesale and Tire Center. ICF and the City independently reviewed
      the information provided by Kittelson & Associates.


Environmental Setting
Roadway System
      The roadway system remains the same as described in the 2007 FEIR.

Traffic Conditions
      To identify the traffic impacts related to the proposed modifications, existing (2012) traffic
      conditions were evaluated for intersections on Middlefield Road adjacent to the project site, which
      include the Middlefield Road/Woodside Road intersection, the Middlefield Road/Willow Street
      intersection, and the Middlefield Road/Charter Street intersection (study intersections). These three
      signalized intersections were identified as having the highest potential to be affected by the
      proposed modifications.

      Since the adoption of the 2007 FEIR, Costco has moved the project entrance at the Middlefield
      Road/Charter Street intersection to the Middlefield Road/Willow Street intersection and
      reconfigured and signalized the Middlefield Road/Willow Street intersection. Costco has also
      dechannelized Middlefield Road and increased the length of left-turn pocket at the Middlefield
      Road/Woodside Road intersection.

      Traffic Volumes
      Manual intersection traffic volume counts were conducted at the three study intersections for the
      weekday PM peak period (4 to 6 p.m.) on May 15, 2012 and Saturday midday peak period (11 a.m. to
      3 p.m.) on May 19, 2012 while school was still in session; the traffic volume counts account for the
      full range of traffic demand experienced in the area under existing conditions.

      To provide context, the traffic counts from May 2012 were compared to other traffic counts
      collected in the study area over the past 6 years since the initial Costco onsite redevelopment
      project was considered. Table 4.3-1 provides a comparison of traffic volumes on Middlefield Road
      between 2006 and 2012.

     In comparing recent volumes (2010, 2012) to those collected before the new Costco warehouse and
     fueling center were constructed (2006, 2008), there have been relatively minimal changes in traffic
     volumes along the corridor. Comparing the most recent counts taken before the old Costco
     warehouse closed (2008) to those taken in May 2012 shows a 3–4 percent increase in traffic along
     Middlefield Road between Woodside Road and Willow Street. Traffic volumes on arterials fluctuate
     on a daily basis, in many cases up to 10 percent, and there has also been other general growth in the
     area. As such, the previously approved Costco expansion is not the only contributor to traffic growth
     in the area, but is one of many contributors.

     Intersection Level of Service
     Methods described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board 2000) were
     used to calculate the intersection level of service (LOS). LOS is a scale used to determine the
     operating quality of a roadway segment or intersection based on volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio or
     average delay experienced by vehicles on the facility. The levels range from A to F, with LOS A
     representing free traffic flow and LOS F representing severe traffic congestion. LOS for signalized
     intersections is determined by the average amount of delay experienced by vehicles at the
     intersection. Table 4.3-2 summarizes the anticipated existing LOS at the study intersections based
     on the weekday PM peak hour counts and weekend midday peak hour counts conducted in May
     2012. All study intersections operate better than the acceptable intersection LOS as defined by the
     City and the City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo County (C/CAG). Detailed traffic
     count data, intersection turning movement volumes, and LOS analysis worksheets are included in
     Appendix B (Middlefield Road Traffic Volumes & Intersection Level of Service prepared by Kittelson
     & Associates, Inc.).

     Although the Middlefield Road/Woodside Road intersection operates at an acceptable LOS during
     the weekday PM peak hour as defined by the C/CAG, queuing at the intersection along both
     roadways during the peak periods can impact operations of adjacent intersections and site access
     points. Based on these observations and input from the public, the City of Redwood City and Costco
     are currently beginning dialogue with Caltrans to investigate potential signal timing changes or
     other enhancements to address the existing peak hour congestion at the Middlefield
     Road/Woodside Road intersection (Kittelson & Associates, Inc. 2012a).

Transit
     Transit bus service in San Mateo County is provided by the San Mateo County Transit District
     (SamTrans) and Caltrain. SamTrans Routes 296, 297, and 397 run along Middlefield Road in the
     vicinity of the project site. Route 296 provides the regular bus service between the Redwood City
     Caltrain station and East Palo Alto. Route 297 provides limited service between the Redwood City
     Caltrain station and the Palo Alto Caltrain station. Route 397 provides limited service between
     Caltrain stations and Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations.

     Caltrain provides commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy. The project site is
     located about 1.2 miles east of the Redwood City Caltrain station, which is located in downtown
     Redwood City at 1 James Avenue. At the Redwood City station, Caltrain provides service with
     approximately 20- to 30-minute headways during the weekday AM and PM commute hours.

Non-Motorized Transportation
     Bicycle facilities are classified into three categories: Class I (bike paths) are described as completely
     separated, off-street, paved right-of-way (shared with pedestrians) paths, which exclude motor
     vehicle traffic; Class II (bike lanes) are striped lanes for one-way bike travel on a roadway; and Class
     III (bike routes) are on-street bike routes. There are no bicycle facilities provided on streets in the
     project area; however, bike lanes or routes are proposed on Woodside Road and Middlefield Road in
     the General Plan (City of Redwood City 2010e).

     Sidewalks are found along both sides of Middlefield Road along the project frontage. There are also
     pedestrian crosswalks on Middlefield Road at the Willow Street intersection and at the Charter
     Street intersection.


Regulatory Setting
Congestion Management Program Compliance
     The C/CAG is responsible for maintaining the performance and standards of the Congestion
     Management Program (CMP) roadway system. The CMP requires new development projected to add
     100 or more peak hour trips to the CMP roadway network to implement travel demand
     management (TDM) measures that would reduce project impacts (C/CAG 2011). Woodside Road/SR
     84 is part of the CMP roadway system; however, the project with proposed modifications would not

     add 100 or more trips [see Table 4.3-4 in this document] to the SR 84 segment in the vicinity of the
     project site. Therefore, an analysis of the TDM requirements would not apply.

     The LOS standard for the Woodside Road/SR 84 roadway segment and the Middlefield
     Road/Woodside Road intersection is LOS E.

Redwood City General Plan
     The Redwood City General Plan (2010b) contains the following transportation policies related to the
     project.
         LOS Policy Evaluation. Maintain LOS D or better for intersections in all areas of the City, except
          the downtown area as defined by the Downtown Precise Plan. The project site is located outside
          of the downtown plan area.
         Pedestrian Enhanced Design Criteria. Conduct engineering studies to determine the feasibility
          of implementing pedestrian enhanced designs that provide multi-modal amenities within the
          public right-of-way by reducing the number of travel lanes on Middlefield Road (from 4 or 5
          lanes to 3 lanes) east of Woodside Road.

Thresholds of Significance
     Thresholds of significance are used to establish what constitutes a project impact. For the analysis of
     the proposed modifications, the thresholds used to determine impacts on study intersections are
     based on the Redwood City LOS standards and the CMP LOS standards.

     Redwood City defines an acceptable LOS D or better for intersections in all areas of the City. A
     project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
     in the City if for any peak hour (City of Redwood City 2010d):
         the LOS at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under existing
          conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under project conditions; or
         the LOS at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under baseline conditions and the
          addition of project trips causes the average control delay at the intersection to increase by five
          (5) or more seconds.

     The CMP defines an acceptable LOS for SR 84 segments as LOS E or better in the project area.
     According to C/CAG policy, a traffic impact on a CMP segment would be considered significant if the
     project or project plus cumulative development would cause an increase in the amount of traffic on
     a CMP segment already exceeding its capacity by adding traffic volumes representing more than 1
     percent of the CMP segment‘s capacity to that segment (City of Redwood City 2010a).

     The 2007 FEIR (page 4.4-6) also included the thresholds of significance for unsignalized
     intersections and local residential roadway segments. The proposed modifications are anticipated to
     generate new trips along major streets (Middlefield Road and Woodside Road) and are expected to
     affect the three signalized intersections in the project vicinity. The proposed modifications are not
     expected to result in additional impacts on unsignalized intersections and local residential roadway
     segments analyzed in the 2007 FEIR. The analysis of the proposed modifications focuses on the
     above thresholds of significance applied to the signalized intersections.

Impact Discussion
Would the project:

a. Cause an increase in traffic which is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and
   capacity of the street system (i.e., result in a substantial increase in either the number of vehicle
   trips, the volume to capacity ration on roads, or congestion at intersections)? For intersection
   circulation, an impact may be identified as significant according to Redwood City thresholds if a
   project:

              Increases the delay at an intersection that currently operates at a LOS E or LOS F by five
               (5) seconds or more; if the intersection is unsignalized, then additional traffic volumes
               must meet the Caltrans peak hour volume warrant for traffic signal installation

              Causes an unsignalized intersection currently operating at LOS D or better to degrade
               to LOE E, and either: 1) increases the delay by 5 seconds or more, or 2) traffic volumes
               exceed the Caltrans peak hour traffic signal warrant criteria.

     For local residential roadway segments, a significant traffic impact would occur if:

              The roadway segment currently carries less than 3,000 vehicles per day; and

              There is an increase in traffic volume of more than 5 percent of the daily or peak hour
               traffic. The absolute minimum threshold is an increase of 5 peak hour trip of 50 daily
               trips for low volume roadways.

     As discussed below, the proposed modifications would not result in any new or more severe
     significant traffic impacts beyond those previously addressed in the 2007 FEIR and 2007 Addendum
     No. 1, and there are no other changes in circumstances, or new information that would necessitate
     any major modification of the traffic, circulation and access discussions in the 2007 FEIR and 2007
     Addendum No. 1.

Construction
     Less-than-Significant New Impact. Construction activities would generate construction-related
     traffic, which could create a temporary increase in localized traffic. Construction of the proposed
     modifications is anticipated to take place in April 2013 and last for approximately 7 weeks. The
     construction is expected to generate truck trips ranging from 4 to 26 trips per day (2 to 13
     truckloads per day). Assuming these trucks would enter and exit the project site over an 8-hour
     work day, construction of the proposed modifications would result in a maximum of four truck trips
     per hour. The number of construction workers would vary during construction with no more than
     15 workers at any given time. Assuming the workers would mostly enter the project site during the
     AM and PM peak hours, construction of the proposed modifications would result in a maximum of
     15 worker trips per hour. Therefore, during the construction period, the proposed modifications are
     expected to generate a maximum of 19 vehicle trips per hour (4 truck trips plus 15 worker trips) in
     the AM and PM peak hours.

     As shown in Table 4.3-2, the intersections near the project site are expected to operate better than
     the City and C/CAG standards. The construction work would only temporarily generate a maximum
     of 19 vehicles per hour in the project vicinity and is not anticipated to degrade the intersection LOS
     at the study intersections. Therefore, the increase in construction traffic would not conflict with the

     City and C/CAG LOS standards. Furthermore, the construction would only last for a period of seven
     weeks and would not result in any lane or road closures. Therefore, new traffic impacts caused by
     the construction of the proposed modifications would be less than significant.

Operation
     Project Trip Estimates
     New vehicle trips associated with the proposed modifications were developed based on trip end
     counts and trip type surveys collected at the existing fueling center and the trip data from other
     Costco wholesale centers in the United States that have similar characteristics as the project with
     the proposed modifications.

     Trip end counts and trip type surveys were collected at the existing facility during the weekday PM
     and weekend midday peak hours. The results of the trip end counts and site-specific trip types, as
     described below, are used to determine the project’s net trip contribution to the roadway system.
     Table 4.3-3 summarizes the existing trip types and resulting net trip contribution based on the
     survey data. Detailed discussions of trip survey and supporting site activities data are included in
     Appendix B (Preliminary Transportation Assessment prepared by Kittelson & Associates, Inc.).
         Internal Trips—A key finding from the data collection is that approximately 22 percent of the
          weekday PM and 47 percent of the Saturday midday peak hour trips (shown in Table 4.3-3) to
          and from the existing fueling center are internal capture trips. Internal capture trips are trips by
          members who patronize both the warehouse and the fueling center during a single visit to the
          Costco site. As such, although they account for a trip to both the warehouse and the fueling
          center, they only account for one overall vehicle trip to the site and on the surrounding
          transportation system.
         Pass-by Trips—Another key trip characteristic that must be considered is pass-by trip capture.
          Pass-by trips represent members (and trips) that are currently traveling on the street adjacent
          to the site (Middlefield Road) for some other primary purpose (such as a trip from work to
          home) and stop at the fueling center en route during their normal travel. As such, pass-by trips
          do not result in a net increase in traffic on the surrounding transportation system and, typically,
          their only effect occurs at the site access driveways where they become turning movements.
          Table 4.3-3 shows that, based on the surveys collected at the existing fueling center, on average
          22 percent of the trips during the weekday PM peak hour and 29 percent of the trips during the
          weekend midday peak hour can be classified as pass-by trip capture from the surrounding street
          system. This is lower than the average capture rate quoted in the Trip Generation Manual
          (Institute of Transportation Engineers 2008) for typical service stations (58 percent in the AM
          and 42 percent in the PM) and, again, is attributable to the unique travel characteristics that
          result from Costco’s membership requirements.
         Diverted Trips—The final type of trip to consider is diverted trips. Diverted trips represent
          members (and trips) that are currently traveling on the surrounding street system in the project
          area again for some other primary purpose (such as a trip from work to home) and divert from
          their normal route to travel to the fueling center. An example would be someone who normally
          travels on Woodside Road on their trip home from work who diverts off of Woodside Road to
          travel on Middlefield Road to the Costco site. As such, diverted trips do not result in a net
          increase to those intersections further from the site that they normally travel through, but they
          do become additional trips on the roadways along their diverted route and at the site driveways.

          Table 4.3-3 shows that, based on the surveys collected at the existing fueling center, on average
          59 percent of the trips during the weekday PM peak hour and 52 percent of the trips during the
          weekend midday peak hour can be classified as diverted trips.

     The proposed modifications would include the addition of 8 fueling stations to the fueling center
     and would increase sales volume from a current annual throughput of approximately 9 million
     gallons to a projected maximum of 18 million gallons (Costco 2012). To determine the appropriate
     peak hour trip generation for the 20-station fueling center, data (peak hour volumes, fueling
     positions, and sales volumes) from other Costco wholesale centers in the United States that have
     similar characteristics as the project with the proposed modifications were reviewed. Based on the
     detailed analysis conducted by Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (2012b), there is no direct correlation
     between peak hour trip generation and fuel sales volume and between peak hour trip generation
     and number of fueling positions. Therefore, the expected trip generation as a result of the proposed
     modifications was estimated by evaluating the Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation
     Engineers 2008) and trip generation patterns seen at other Costco Gasoline facilities including those
     with five islands and those with sales volume equal to or greater than that in Redwood City. Detailed
     discussions of the trip generation research and the resulting recommendation are included in
     Appendix B. Table 4.3-3 summarizes the projected total trips and net new trips that would result
     from the project with the proposed modifications. The total projected trips are estimated based on
     the trip generation data at other Costco Gasoline facilities with five islands. The net new trips were
     calculated by deducting the internal trips, pass-by trips, and diverted trips that were observed at the
     existing facility.

     Intersection Level of Service
     Less-than-Significant New Impact. As shown in Table 4.3-3, the proposed modifications would
     result in a net regional increase of 20 new trips per hour compared to existing 2012 conditions.
     However, for street intersections adjacent to the project site, the proposed modifications would
     result in a net increase of 80 new trips (20 net new trips plus 50 diverted trips plus 10 pass-by trips)
     in the weekday PM peak hour and 70 new trips (20 net new trips plus 40 diverted trips plus 10
     pass-by trips) in the weekend midday peak hour with the diverted trips3. Table 4.3-4 summarizes
     the estimated traffic volumes with the proposed modifications at the study intersections for
     weekday PM peak hour and weekend midday peak hour. Detailed discussions of trip assignment and
     intersection turning movement volumes in the weekday PM peak hour are included in Appendix B.


3 Pass-by trips do not result in any increase in traffic external to the Costco site. These trips only consist of people
passing by the site that decide to shop at the warehouse and/or fuel their vehicle.

     Table 4.3-5 summarizes the expected intersection LOS with the implementation of proposed
     modifications. The LOS analysis was conducted for the critical weekday PM peak hour. The
     additional external trips associated with the proposed modifications to the fueling center were
     assigned to the study intersections based on existing travel patterns and turning movements. These
     assigned project trips were then added to the existing conditions traffic volumes to develop the
     existing plus proposed modifications traffic volumes for the weekday PM peak hour. The existing
     plus proposed modifications traffic volumes and the corresponding weekday PM peak hour
     intersection LOS worksheets are included in the Appendix B. As shown in Table 4.3-5, with the
     addition of proposed modification traffic volumes, all intersection LOS would remain below the City
     and C/CAG standards with only minor changes in overall intersection average delay. It is anticipated
     that, during the weekend midday peak hour, all intersection LOS would also remain below the City
     and C/CAG standards with the addition of proposed modification traffic volumes. Therefore, new
     traffic impacts caused by the operation of the proposed modifications would be less than significant.

     Vehicle Queuing and Waiting
     No New Impact. To evaluate the vehicle queuing and waiting time as a result of the proposed
     modifications, operation of two existing five-island (20 fueling position) Costco Gasoline facilities in
     the continental United States were reviewed and compared to the observed vehicle queuing and
     waiting time at the existing three island fueling center. Detailed discussions of the vehicle queuing
     and waiting analysis are included in Appendix B. The analysis shows that even though one of the two
     locations generates about 100 more total trip ends during the weekday PM peak hour, it has shorter
     queues and significantly shorter vehicle wait times than those that occur at the Redwood City
     location under existing conditions. Therefore, the proposed modifications are not expected to result
     in a significant new impact on vehicle queue and waiting at the fueling center and should actually
     reduce vehicle queuing.

     Parking
     No New Impact. The proposed modifications would result in a net parking supply gain of two stalls
     (for a new total parking count of 747 spaces). While some parking would be removed immediately
     adjacent to the fueling center to accommodate two additional fuel islands, the parking spaces in that
     location would be replaced by parking modifications and restriping (from existing 10-foot wide
     stalls to 9-foot wide stalls) in other areas. There is currently sufficient parking onsite and a net gain
     of one stall in parking supply associated with the proposed modifications. There would be sufficient
     parking onsite to accommodate the typical and seasonal peak parking demands with the proposed
     modifications. It is not anticipated that the proposed modifications would significantly increase or
     noticeably change parking demand on the site. However, even if parking demand does increase,
     according to the existing parking survey (see Appendix B), there is still 17 percent reserve capacity
     during the peak half hour within the Costco parcel (or approximately 125 spaces assuming parking
     is “full” at 90 percent occupancy) to accommodate a fluctuation in parking demand. No new impact
     would occur.

b. Exceed, either individually or cumulatively, a level of service standard established by the county
   congestion management agency for designated roads or highways?

Construction
     Less-than-Significant New Impact. As discussed in Section 4.3.a above, construction of the
     proposed modifications would not cause the SR 84/Middlefield Road intersection to exceed the CMP
     LOS standard. Therefore, new traffic impacts on this CMP facility would be less than significant.

Operation
     Less-than-Significant New Impact. SR 84 within the project area is part of the CMP roadway
     system; however, as discussed in Section 4.3.a above, the proposed modifications would only add a
     maximum of 41 peak hour trips to SR 84 and the trips resulting from the proposed modifications
     would not cause the SR 84/Middlefield Road intersection to exceed the CMP LOS standard.
     Therefore, new traffic impacts would be less than significant.

c.   Substantially increase hazards because of a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous
     intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment)?

Construction
     Less-than-Significant New Impact. Construction traffic generated by the proposed modifications
     would temporarily increase truck volumes on Middlefield Road, which is designated as a truck
     traffic route (Redwood City Municipal Code Section 20.52). However, truck trips resulting from the
     proposed modifications on these roadways are relatively low (four truck trips per hour) and the
     general mix of traffic would be consistent with traffic volumes under current operations at the
     existing Costco warehouse and fueling center. Once construction activities are complete,
     construction truck traffic would cease. As such, construction of the proposed modifications would
     not result in a safety hazard due to the use of the roadways in the project area. New impacts would
     be less than significant.

Operation
     No New Impact. Safety impacts are considered significant if design elements of the proposed
     modifications would result in conditions that would increase the risk of accidents, either for
     vehicular or non-motorized traffic. Safety impacts were evaluated for the corner sight distance at the
     driveway at the site of the proposed modifications and onsite circulation. The proposed
     modifications would involve changes to the existing fueling center restricted to the Costco property.
     No change would occur to the design at the Costco entrance driveway and on local streets adjacent
     to the project site. Therefore, no obstacles to sight distance would result from the driveway at the
     project site. As discussed in Section 4.3.a above, the proposed modifications are expected to reduce
     the vehicle queues and waiting times at the existing fueling center, which would also improve onsite
     circulation. No new impact would occur.

d. Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or
   pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities?

     No New Impact. The proposed modifications would not result in any physical changes to the
     transportation system or traffic operations that would affect current or future planned transit or
     non-motorized transportation. No new impact would occur.

 When available, the significance criteria
 established by the applicable air quality
 management or air pollution control district may
 be relied upon to make the following
 determinations. Would the project:
 a.   Conflict with or obstruct implementation of
      the applicable air quality plan?
 b.   Violate any air quality standard or
      contribute substantially to an existing or
      projected air quality violation?
 c.   Result in a cumulatively considerable net
      increase of any criteria pollutant for which
      the project region is a nonattainment area

      quality standard (including releasing
      emissions that exceed quantitative
      thresholds for ozone precursors)?
 d. Expose sensitive receptors to substantial
      pollutant concentrations?
 e.   Create objectionable odors affecting a
      substantial number of people?



Air Quality
     The air quality impacts of the proposed modifications were evaluated based on the air quality and
     climate change analysis prepared by the Ashworth Leininger Group (ALG) for the proposed
     modifications to the fueling center (Ashworth Leininger Group 2012) and the air quality impact
     analysis prepared for the existing Costco Facilities in the 2007 FEIR. The air quality and climate
     change analysis is included in Appendix A.

Environmental Setting
Climate
     The project site is located in San Mateo County within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin
     (SFBAAB). Climate within the SFBAAB is characterized by moderately wet winters and dry
     summers. Climate in the project area is affected by marine air flow and the County’s close proximity
     to the San Francisco Bay. Bay breezes push air onshore during the daytime and draw air from the
     land offshore at night. During the summer months, the Bay helps to cool the warm onshore flows,
     while during the winter months, it warms the air. This mediating effect keeps temperatures
     relatively consistent throughout the year. However, the Bay wind patterns can concentrate and
     carry pollutants from other cities to the area, adding to the locally emitted pollutant mix (Bay Area
     Air Quality Management District 2011).

Overview of Pollutants
     The air quality management agencies of direct importance in the project area are the U.S.
     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (ARB), and BAAQMD.
     The EPA and ARB have established national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and California
     ambient air quality standards (CAAQS), respectively, for the following six criteria pollutants: carbon
     monoxide (CO); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); sulfur dioxide (SO2); ozone (O3); lead; and particulate
     matter (PM), including PM less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10) and PM less than or
     equal to 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5). Ozone and NO2 are considered to be regional pollutants,
     as these pollutants affect air quality on a regional scale. Pollutants such as CO, SO2, and lead are
     considered to be local pollutants. PM is considered both a regional and a local pollutant.

     The pollutants of concern in the San Mateo County are ozone and PM because they are designated as
     nonattainment for the NAAQS and CAAQS in the San Mateo County. The following discussion
     describes these criteria pollutants. Toxic air contaminants (TACs) are also discussed, although there
     are no established federal or state standards for these pollutants.

     Ozone is a nearly colorless, odorless gas that irritates the lungs and damages materials and
     vegetation. Ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but is formed by a photochemical reaction in
     the atmosphere. Ozone precursors, which include reactive organic gases (ROG) and nitrogen oxides
     (NOX), react in the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. Because photochemical
     reaction rates depend on the intensity of ultraviolet light and air temperature, ozone is primarily a
     summer air pollution problem. ROG and NOX are emitted by mobile sources and by stationary
     combustion equipment.

     Carbon monoxide is a highly toxic, odorless, colorless gas that binds to hemoglobin in the
     bloodstream in the place of oxygen molecules. By reducing the oxygen-carrying potential of blood,
     CO causes heart difficulties in people with chronic diseases, reduces lung capacity, impairs mental
     functioning by interfering with the transfer of oxygen to the brain, and may aggravate
     arteriosclerosis. Motor vehicles are the dominant source of CO emissions in most areas. High CO
     levels develop primarily during winter when periods of light winds combine with the formation of
     ground-level temperature inversions (typically from the evening through early morning). These
     conditions result in reduced dispersion of vehicle emissions. Motor vehicles also exhibit increased
     CO emission rates at low air temperatures.

     Particulate matter refers to finely divided solids or liquids such as soot, dust, aerosols, and mists.
     Suspended particulates aggravate chronic heart and lung disease problems, produce respiratory
     problems, and often transport toxic elements. Suspended particulates also absorb sunlight,
     producing haze and reducing visibility. PM is caused primarily by dust from grading and excavation
     activities, from agricultural uses, and from motor vehicles, particularly diesel-powered vehicles.
     PM10 causes a greater health risk than larger particles, since these fine particles can more easily
     penetrate the defenses of the human respiratory system.

     PM2.5, like PM10, is primarily generated by combustion in motor vehicles, particularly diesel
     engines, as well as by industrial sources and residential/agricultural activities such as burning. It is
     also formed through the reaction of other pollutants. Like PM10, these particulates can increase the
     chance of respiratory disease and can cause lung damage and cancer.

     Toxic air contaminants are pollutants that may result in an increase in mortality or serious illness,
     or that may pose a present or potential hazard to human health. Health effects of TACs include
     cancer, birth defects, neurological damage, damage to the body’s natural defense system, and
     diseases that lead to death. In 1998, following a 10-year scientific assessment process, ARB
     identified PM from diesel-fueled engines as a TAC. Compared to other air toxics ARB has identified,
     diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions are estimated to be responsible for about 70 percent of
     the total ambient air toxics risk (California Air Resources Board 2000).

Local Air Quality
     The existing air quality conditions in the project area are characterized by monitoring data collected
     by BAAQMD in San Mateo County, which are used to designate areas as nonattainment,
     maintenance, attainment, or unclassified for the NAAQS and CAAQS. The four designations are
     further defined as follows:
         Nonattainment: Assigned to areas where monitored pollutant concentrations consistently
          violate the standard in question.
         Maintenance: Assigned to areas where monitored pollutant concentrations exceeded the
          standard in question in the past, but are no longer in violation of that standard.
         Attainment: Assigned to areas where pollutant concentrations meet the standard in question
          over a designated period of time.
         Unclassified: Assigned to areas where data are insufficient to determine whether a pollutant is
          violating the standard in question.

     Table 4.4-1 summarizes the attainment status of San Mateo County with regard to the NAAQS and
     CAAQS.

Sensitive Receptors
     BAAQMD defines sensitive receptors as facilities or land uses that include members of the
     population that are particularly sensitive to the effects of air pollutants, such as children, the elderly,
     and people with illnesses. Examples include schools, hospitals, and residential areas (Bay Area Air
     Quality Management District 2011).

     The land surrounding the project site is primarily used for commercial and industrial use. The
     closest sensitive receptors are the residential area located 800 feet north of the project site across
     Middlefield Road and the residential area located 600 feet south of the project site across the
     Caltrain tracks. Figure 4.4-1 shows the sensitive receptors in the project vicinity.


Regulatory Setting
Clean Air Act
     The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) establishes EPA’s responsibilities to protect and improve the
     nation‘s air quality. EPA oversees the implementation of federal programs for setting air quality
     standards, permitting new and modified stationary sources, controlling toxic air contaminants, and
     reducing emissions from motor vehicles and other mobile sources. EPA also requires that each state
     prepare and submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) that consists of background information,
     rules, technical documentation, and agreements that an individual state will use to attain
     compliance with the NAAQS within federally-imposed deadlines. State and local agencies implement
     the plans and rules associated with the SIP, but the rules are also federally enforceable.

California Clean Air Act
     The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) establishes a statewide air pollution control program for
     California. ARB is the primary administrator of the CCAA. ARB’s main responsibilities are to develop,
     adopt, implement, and enforce the state’s motor vehicle pollution control program; administer and
     coordinate the state‘s air pollution research program; adopt and update the CAAQS; review the
     operations of the local air pollution control districts; and review and coordinate the state’s SIP for
     achieving NAAQS.

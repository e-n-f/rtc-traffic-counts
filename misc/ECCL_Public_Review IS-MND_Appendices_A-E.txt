                                                                   EMERYVILLE, ALAMEDA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA




                     LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CONTEXTS




California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
CEQA applies to all discretionary projects undertaken or subject to approval by the state's public
agencies (California Code of Regulations [CCR] Title 14(3) §15002(i)). Under the provisions of
CEQA, "A project with an effect that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a
historical resource is a project that may have a significant effect on the environment" (CCR Title
14(3) §15064.5(b)).

CEQA §15064.5(a) defines a "historical resource" as a resource which meets one or more of the
following criteria:

     Listed in, or eligible for listing in, the California Register of Historical Resources;
     Listed in a local register of historical resources (as defined at PRC §5020.1(k));
     Identified as significant in a historical resource survey meeting the requirements of §5024.1(g) of
     the Public Resources Code; or
     Determined to be a historical resource by a project's lead agency (CCR Title 14(3) §15064.5(a)).
A historical resource consists of "Any object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or
manuscript which a lead agency determines to be historically significant or significant in the
architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or
cultural annals of California...Generally, a resource shall be considered by the lead agency to be
`historically significant' if the resource meets the criteria for listing in the California Register of
Historical Resources" (CCR Title 14(3) §15064.5(a)(3)).

CEQA requires that historical resources and unique archaeological resources be taken into
consideration during the CEQA planning process (CCR Title 14(3) §15064.5; PRC §21083.2). If
feasible, adverse effects to the significance of historical resources must be avoided, or the effects
mitigated (CCR Title 14(3) §15064.5(b)(4)). The significance of a historical resource is impaired
when a project demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of a
historical resource that convey its historical significance and that justify its eligibility for the
California Register of Historical Resources. If there is a substantial adverse change in the significance
of a historical resource, the preparation of an environmental impact report may be required (CCR
Title 14(3) §15065(a)).

If the cultural resource in question is an archaeological site, CEQA (CCR Title 14(3) §15064.5(c)(1))
requires that the lead agency first determine if the site is a historical resource as defined in CCR Title
14(3) §15064.5(a). If the site qualifies as a historical resource, potential adverse impacts must be
considered in the same manner as a historical resource (California Office of Historic Preservation
2001a:8). If the archaeological site does not qualify as a historical resource but does qualify as a
unique archaeological site, then the archaeological site is treated in accordance with PRC §21083.2
(CCR Title 14(3) §15069.5(c)(3)). In practice, most archaeological sites that meet the definition of a

                                                                      EMERYVILLE, ALAMEDA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA




unique archaeological resource will also meet the definition of a historical resource (Bass, Herson,
and Bogdan 1999:105). CEQA defines a "unique archaeological resource" as an archaeological
artifact, object, or site about which it can be clearly demonstrated that, without merely adding to the
current body of knowledge, there is a high probability that it meets one or more of the following
criteria:

     Contains information needed to answer important scientific research questions and that there is a
     demonstrable public interest in that information; or
     Has a special and particular quality such as being the oldest of its type or the best available
     example of its type; or
     Is directly associated with a scientifically recognized important prehistoric or historic event or
     person (PRC §21083.2(g)).

If an impact to a historical or archaeological resource is significant, CEQA requires feasible measures
to minimize the impact (CCR Title 14(3) §15126.4 (a)(1)). Mitigation of significant impacts must
lessen or eliminate the physical impact that the project will have on the resource. Generally, the use of
drawings, photographs, and/or displays does not mitigate the physical impact on the environment
caused by demolition or destruction of a historical resource. However, CEQA requires that all
feasible mitigation be undertaken even if it does not mitigate impacts to a less than significant level
(California Office of Historic Preservation 2001a:9; see also CCR Title 14(3) §15126.4(a)(1)).

California Register of Historical Resources
Section 5024.1 of the PRC established the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR).
Generally, a resource is considered by the lead agency to be `historically significant' if the resource
meets the criteria for listing on the California Register (CCR Title 14(3) § 15064.5(a)(3)). For a
cultural resource to qualify for listing in the California Register it must be significant under one or
more of the following criteria:
·    Criterion 1:          Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
                           patterns of California's history and cultural heritage;
·    Criterion 2:          Associated with the lives of persons important in our past;
·    Criterion 3:          Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of
                           construction, or represents the work of an important creative individual, or
                           possesses high artistic values; or
·    Criterion 4:          Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
                           history.
In addition to being significant under one or more of these criteria, a resource must retain enough of
its historic character and appearance to be recognizable as an historical resource and be able to
convey the reasons for its significance (CCR Title 14 Section 4852(c)). Generally, a cultural resource
must be 50 years or older to be eligible for the California Register.

California Public Resources Code §5097.5
California Public Resources Code §5097.5 prohibits excavation or removal of any "vertebrate
paleontological site...or any other archaeological, paleontological or historical feature, situated on
public lands, except with express permission of the public agency having jurisdiction over such
lands." Public lands are defined to include lands owned by or under the jurisdiction of the state or any
city, county, district, authority or public corporation, or any agency thereof. Section 5097.5 states that
any unauthorized disturbance or removal of archaeological, historical, or paleontological materials or
sites located on public lands is a misdemeanor.

California Health and Safety Code §7050.5
Section 7050.5 of the California Health and Safety Code states that in the event of discovery or
recognition of any human remains in any location other than a dedicated cemetery, there shall be no
further excavation or disturbance of the site or any nearby area reasonably suspected to overlie
adjacent remains until the coroner of the county in which the remains are discovered has determined
whether or not the remains are subject to the coroner's authority. If the human remains are of Native
American origin, the coroner must notify the Native American Heritage Commission within 24 hours
of this identification. The Native American Heritage Commission will identify a Native American
Most Likely Descendant (MLD) to inspect the site and provide recommendations for the proper
treatment of the remains and associated grave goods.

                                                   PROJECT SETTING




Environmental Setting
The 7.7-acre project site is located at 1100 47th Street in unsectioned land of Rancho San Antonio (V
& D Peralta), Township 1 South/Range 4 West, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian, as shown on
the accompanying portion of the U.S. Geological Survey Oakland West, Calif. 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle (Figure 2). The project site is generally bound by 53rd Street to the north, San
Pablo Avenue to the east, 47th Street to the south, and Emery Bay Village (a residential
neighborhood) to the west.

The project site is approximately 40 feet above mean sea level on a nearly level alluvial plain, with a
gentle downhill gradient to the southwest. Based on three geotechnical borings completed by BAGG
Engineers, the project site's subsurface geological conditions consists of "inter-layered and inter-
fingered deposits of gravels, sand, silt, and clay, and their mixtures, typical of alluvial deposits"
(BAGG Engineers 2009:16). Holocene (10,000 years before present [B.P.] to present) alluvial
deposits underlie the project site and are likely underlain by older Pleistocene (2.6 million to 10,000
years B.P.) alluvium.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (2012) classifies soils in the project site as "urban land"
and "urban land-Clear Lake Complex." Urban land consists of fill from mixed sources; Clear Lake
soil is formed in alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary sources and tends to be very deep and
poorly drained.

The closest natural water sources to the project site are Temescal Creek, which once flowed through
the center of the project site but has since been routed through a culvert; and San Francisco Bay,
approximately 3,500 feet to the west.

The native vegetation of the project site and vicinity consisted of a coastal prairie-scrub mosaic
(Kuchler 1977), characterized by dense bunchgrasses and forbs, including oatgrass (Danthonia
californica) and red fescue (Festuca rubra).

Cultural Setting
The prehistory and ethnographic background of the project site are described below. The historical
context of the project site, because it is a component of the historical evaluation, is presented in the
Eligibility Evaluation section found later in this report.

Prehistory. The Paleo-Archaic-Emergent cultural sequence developed by Fredrickson (1974) is
commonly used to interpret the prehistoric occupation of Central California. The sequence consists of
three broad periods: the Paleoindian Period (10,000-6000 B.C.); the three-staged Archaic Period,
consisting of the Lower Archaic (6000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3000-500 B.C.), and Upper
Archaic (500 B.C.-A.D. 1000); and the Emergent Period (A.D. 1000-1800).

The Paleo Period began with the first entry of people into California. These people probably subsisted
mainly on big game, minimally processed plant foods, and had few or no trade networks. Current
research, however, is indicating more sedentism, plant processing, and trading than previously
believed. During the Lower Archaic, milling stones appear in abundance and hunting is less important
than plant foods. Artifacts are made predominantly from local materials, suggesting that few if any
extensive trade networks were established at this time. During the Middle Archaic, the subsistence
base begins to expand and diversify with a developing acorn economy, as evidenced by the mortar
and pestle, and the growing importance of hunting. Status and wealth distinctions are evidenced in the
Upper Archaic archaeological record; regional exchange networks are well established at this time
with exchange of goods and ideas, such as obsidian and Kuksu ceremonial practices involving spirit
impersonations. Increasing social complexity continued during the Lower Emergent. Territorial
boundaries were well established by this time with regularized inter-group exchanges involving more
and varied goods, people, and ideas. Bow and arrow technology was also introduced. By the Upper
Emergent, a monetary system based on the exchange of clamshell disk beads was established. Native
population reached its zenith during this time, as evidenced by high site densities and large village
sites in the archaeological record.

Historically, archaeological excavations in the East Bay have focused on shellmounds. These sites
often contain a rich, diverse assemblage of dietary remains, artifacts, and human remains.
Excavations at two major shellmounds near the project site--the Emeryville Shellmound, CA-ALA-
309, and the West Berkeley Shellmound, CA-ALA-307--have helped refine our understanding of the
Bay Area's earliest inhabitants. Excavations at the Emeryville Shellmound (Nelson 1996; Schenck
1926; Uhle 1907) have identified hundreds of human burials, groundstone (e.g., mortars, pestles, and
"charmstones"), flaked stone (e.g., obsidian and chert projectile points and flaking debris), bone tools,
and dietary debris, including clams, mussels, oysters, and land and sea mammal bones. Uhle (1907),
Nelson (1996), and Bennyhoff (1986) have identified temporal changes in artifact types, dietary
refuse, and human interments in multiple strata at the site. Excavations at the West Berkeley
Shellmound have identified an assemblage as diverse as the Emeryville Shellmound's, with two
cultural components; the oldest component is believed to predate 2000 B.C. and the earliest known
occupation of the Emeryville Shellmound (Wallace and Lathrap 1975:55, 58).

Ethnography. The project site is situated within territory once occupied by Costanoan--also
commonly referred to as Ohlone--language groups. Eight mutually unintelligible Ohlone languages
were spoken in an area extending from the southern edge of the Carquinez Strait to portions of the
Sur and Salinas rivers south of Monterey Bay (Shipley 1978). The Ohlone language spoken by the
eastern bayshore groups was Chochenyo, which was spoken by about 2,000 people from Richmond to
Mission San Jose and possibly as far east as the Livermore Valley (Levy 1978:485).

Ohlone territories were comprised of one or more land holding groups that anthropologists refer to as
"tribelets." The tribelet, a nearly universal characteristic throughout native California, consists of a
principle village occupied year round, and a series of smaller hamlets and resource gathering and
processing locations occupied intermittently or seasonally (Kroeber 1955). Populations of tribelets
ranged between 50 and 500 persons and were largely determined by the carrying capacity of a
tribelet's territory. According to Milliken (1995:243), the Huchiun tribelet occupied the Emeryville
area at the time of Spanish contact.

Tribelet political organization included the position of chief (Levy 1978:487-488), who inherited his
or her office patrilineally and required the community's approval to assume the role. Although the
chief had little coercive power over the population, administrative responsibilities and influence did
accompany the position. The chief's responsibilities involved directing ceremonial activities and
dances; caring for captive animals, including grizzly bears and coyotes; feeding visiting members
from other villages; and overseeing subsistence-related hunting and gathering activities.

Ohlone groups employed a sexual division of labor to hunt and gather food. Women gathered and
processed a variety of nuts, seeds, and berries (Levy 1978:491). Important food staples included
acorns gathered from different oak species; nuts from the buckeye tree; hazelnuts; grassland and plant
seeds from buttercup, chia, redmaids, tarweed, and grey pine; wild strawberries, elderberries,
madrone berries; and wild grapes. The diet was supplemented with hunting and gathering numerous
creek, shore, and terrestrial species (Levy 1978:491-492; Margolin 1978:40). Small creeks in the hills
were fished for trout, while groups with access to bay and estuarine resources acquired shellfish,
waterfowl, salmon, sturgeon, and lamprey eels. Larger terrestrial mammals (e.g., grizzly bear,
Roosevelt elk, and black tailed deer) were hunted with the bow and arrow while communal drives and
nets were used to capture smaller game (e.g., rabbits, mice, and rats).

Resources were distributed via trade networks between the Ohlone and neighboring groups (Davis
1974:19). Ohlone traded abalone, mussels, salt, Olivella shells, and bows to the Sierra Miwok and
Yokuts groups to the east. Pinon nuts obtained from the Yokuts are the only ethnographically
documented import of Ohlone groups, although undoubtedly other significant economic items,
including obsidian used for tools, were imported as well.

By the late eighteenth century, Spanish exploration and settlement of the Bay Area transformed
Ohlone culture. Spanish settlers moved into northern California and established the mission system
that exposed the Ohlone to diseases to which they had no immunity. Mission records indicate that the
first Huchiun was baptized in 1787 with the first large group from that tribelet arriving at Mission San
Francisco in the fall of 1794 (Milliken 1995:243). Following the secularization of the missions in
1834, many Ohlone worked as manual laborers on ranchos (Levy 1978:486).

                                                   METHODS




Background research was done to identify cultural resources within and cultural resource studies of
the project site. The research consisted of record searches at the Northwest Information Center, the
Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey, the Native American Heritage Commission, the University of
California Museum of Paleontology, archival research and a literature and map review. The Alameda
County Historical Society was also consulted to determine if it has information or concerns about
cultural resources in the project site.

Records Searches
A records search of the project site was conducted on May 18, 2012, at the Northwest Information
Center (NWIC) of the California Historical Resources Information System, Sonoma State University,
Rohnert Park. The NWIC, an affiliate of the State of California Office of Historic Preservation, is the
official state repository of cultural resource records and reports for Alameda County.

As part of the records search LSA also reviewed the following State of California inventories for
cultural resources in and adjacent to the project site:
·    California Inventory of Historic Resources (California Department of Parks and Recreation
     1976);
·    Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (California Office of Historic
     Preservation 1988);
·    California Historical Landmarks (California Office of Historic Preservation 1996);
·    California Points of Historical Interest (California Office of Historic Preservation 1992); and
·    Directory of Properties in the Historic Property Data File (California Office of Historic
     Preservation August 15, 2011). The directory includes the listings of the National Register of
     Historic Places, National Historic Landmarks, the California Register of Historical Resources,
     California Historical Landmarks, and California Points of Historical Interest.

Native American Heritage Commission
On May 29, 2012, LSA faxed a letter describing the project and a map depicting the project site to the
Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) in Sacramento requesting a review of their Sacred
Lands File for any Native American cultural resources that might be affected by the proposed project.
The NAHC is the official state repository of Native American sacred site location records in
California.

University of California Museum of Paleontology
A fossil locality search conducted in 2009 by staff of the University of California Museum of
Paleontology (UCMP), Berkeley, for a nearby project in Emeryville (Pulcheon 2009) was also
reviewed. The fossil locality search included a five-mile search radius, which encompasses the

current project site. The purpose of the fossil locality search was to (1) identify known
paleontological sites (fossils) in or near the project site, and (2) to identify the geologic formations
and types of fossils that might be expected within and adjacent to the project site based on geological
and paleontological data.

Literature Review
LSA reviewed the following publications, maps, and websites for historical information about the
project site and its vicinity:
·    Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks of San Francisco and Northern California (American
     Society of Civil Engineers, San Francisco Section 1977);
·    California Place Names (Gudde 1998);
·    Historic Spots in California (Hoover et al. 1990);
·    California 1850: A Snapshot in Time (Marschner 2000);
·    Historical Atlas of California (Hayes 2007);
·    Oakland West, Calif., 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle (U.S. Geological Survey 1949, 1959,
     1968, 1973, 1980, 1992, 1993);
·    Sanborn Fire Insurance Company Maps for Oakland (1902, 1911, 1951, 1953, 1967);
·    An Architectural Guidebook to San Francisco and the Bay Area (Cerny 2007);
·    Online Archive of California at <http://www.oac.cdlib.org>; and
·    Calisphere at http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu.

Archival Research
On May 18, 2012, LSA conducted archival research at the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey (OCHS)
office. The OCHS, a department within the City of Oakland, is the City's repository for historical
architectural survey data compiled by OCHS staff. The OCHS has ranked most buildings in Oakland
according to the City's own rating system, as described in the City of Oakland's Historic Preservation
Elements of its General Plan. Materials reviewed included historical maps and OCHS survey map
sheets completed during OCHS field surveys adjacent to the project site in 1986. Research was done
to determine if the project may affect adjacent historical resources identified by OCHS staff.

Field Survey
LSA architectural historian Michael Hibma, M.A., conducted a field survey of the project site
surrounding neighborhood on May 25, 2012. The exterior of the District Administration, Music, and
Plant Services buildings were reviewed and photographed. Mr. Hibma visually reviewed and
photographed the surrounding Emery Secondary School campus buildings and grounds and reviewed
the architectural context of the surrounding neighborhood.

                                                   STUDY RESULTS




This section presents the results of the LSA background research and field survey.

Record Searches
The NWIC records search indicated that there are no previously recorded cultural resources within
the project site and no previous cultural resources studies of the project site. Prehistoric
archaeological sites have been identified, however, to the west of the project site along Temescal
Creek, consisting of CA-ALA-309 ("Emeryville Shellmound"), CA-ALA-310, CA-ALA-311, CA-
ALA-312, CA-ALA-313, and P-01-010873. Although these sites have been severely impacted by
development, significant portions of these sites may exist subsurface. In addition, historical
archaeological site CA-ALA-634H/P-01-010978 was identified south of the project site during
construction of the Pixar Animation Studio campus. This deposit consisted mostly of glass and
ceramics associated with establishments that existed in area ca. 1848-1950s, including saloons,
rooming houses, and stables.

Native American Heritage Commission
Debbie Pilas-Treadway, NAHC Environmental Specialist III, responded in a faxed letter on June 19,
2012 that a review of the Sacred Lands File "has failed to indicate the presence of Native American
cultural resources in the immediate project area."

University of California Museum of Paleontology
The UCMP fossil locality search did not identify localities in or adjacent to the project site. Fossils in
the same Late Pleistocene deposits that underlie the general vicinity, however, have been identified,
indicating general paleontological sensitivity. There is the possibility of encountering significant
paleontological resources in the Pleistocene alluvium that is overlain by Holocene alluvium.

Literature Review
LSA reviewed ethnographic and archaeological information about the project site and its vicinity to
determine the potential for Native American archaeological deposits and human remains. Although
Native American sites are along the Temescal Creek drainage, no such prehistoric or ethnographic
sites were identified in the project site in the literature (Kroeber 1925; Nelson 1909), although the
potential exists that Native American sites and remains underlie fill and existing construction at the
project site.

Sanborn Fire Insurance Company maps were reviewed to determine development of the project site
during the early twentieth century. By 1902, eight buildings and structures had been constructed on
the project site. This early map also depicts Temescal Creek in the project site. Sometime between
1902 and 1911, several residences had been constructed in the project site along the south side of
Santa Fe Avenue (now 53rd Street), north of Temescal Creek. By 1951, Temescal Creek had been
routed beneath the project site, the Emeryville Motorcycle Speedway had been constructed at the west

end of the site, and Emery High School was present at the east end of the site along San Pablo
Avenue.

Historical Aerial Photograph Review. A 1931 aerial photograph depicts the former Emery High
School (built 1920) at the northwest corner of 47th Street and San Pablo Avenue. An open
field/playground is at the rear of the building. To the west and south are open areas, with industrial
development closer to the bayshore and railroad tracks.

A 1946 aerial photograph depicts a heavily transformed urban landscape with major residential
developments to the north across 53rd Street and to the east across San Pablo Avenue. Within the
project site a new gymnasium building is west of the Emery High School building. To the north is the
present-day Emery School District Administration Offices building. Sanborn Fire Insurance Company
Maps for 1951 call this building a City Library. North of and adjacent to the library building is a
warehouse building.

A 1959 aerial photograph depicts similar features and land use patterns as shown in the 1946
photograph. The project site's western property line is clearly demarcated by trees. The original, 1920
Emery High School building is depicted along with the gymnasium, as described above. To the north
of the high school building, the City Library (District Administrative Offices) and former materials
storage warehouse described above are depicted. To the west and south of the library are the Music
Building and a rectangular Central Plant Building.

The 1968 and 1980 aerial photographs depict the current building footprints and spatial arrangement
of the project site.

Please see the References Consulted section for a complete list of materials reviewed.

Archival Research
The OCHS records indicate that it has surveyed residential properties along the north side of 53rd
Street and San Pablo Avenue adjacent to the project site. The OCHS has rated several of these
residential properties as "Dc3" or provided no rating due to a lack of apparent significance at the time
of the survey. As detailed in the City of Oakland's Historic Preservation Element "Dc3" indicates a
building that is not within a historic district and is of "Minor Importance" with a potential to become
of "Secondary Importance" through rehabilitation.

Field Survey
A cultural resources field survey of the project site was conducted by an LSA archaeologist and an
LSA architectural historian on May 25, 2012. The survey was done to (1) examine buildings 50 years
old and older to identify their architectural style, character defining features, and assess their
historical integrity, and (2) inspect exposed surfaces for archaeological materials. The survey was
documented with field notes, maps, and photographs.

Buildings and hardscape features precluded a thorough archaeological survey of the project site.
Landscaped areas, including planting strips and the athletic field, were inspected, with the latter
traversed in two-meter wide transects. Modern debris, vegetation, and fill were cleared in intermittent
scrapes with a trowel. Soils inside the planting strips were a medium- to moderately dark-brown

silty-sandy loam and were a light-brown sandy loam at the athletic field. No archaeological materials
were identified during the field survey.

The built environment field survey of the project site identified the Emeryville School Administration
Office District (District) which comprises three contributing elements . Each element is described
below.

District Administrative Offices Building. Built in 1949 and located at 1727 San Pablo Avenue, this
single-story, 2,251-square-foot wood-frame building is designed in a vernacular adaptation of the
International Style. The building is done in a rectangular-plan, finished in textured stucco, and is
capped by a flat roof. The primary façade is symmetrical in design, faces San Pablo Avenue to the
east, and is totally obscured from the street by a 10-foot high concrete wall with an aggregate rock
finish. The main entrance is located underneath a flat-roofed canopy subsequently added in 1964 and
mimics the design motifs of the Emery Secondary School campus. The entrance consists of a
replacement glazed door set in an aluminum frame underneath a recessed arched entryway flanked by
fixed pane dimpled glass. A brick-masonry chimney is located on the south façade. Fenestration
consists is an assortment of aluminum-framed slider windows and sash windows in the original
wooden frames. One window on the left side of the south façade has been removed and the casement
filled in with stucco-clad wood framing. There is an approximately 850-square-foot undated addition
on the rear of building. Originally constructed as the Emeryville City Library, this building is
currently used as administrative office space for the Emery Unified School District.

Music Building. Built in 1957 and located approximately 10 feet to the west of the Administrative
Building, this two-story, 2,331-square-foot wood-frame is designed in a vernacular adaptation of the
International Style. The rectangular-plan building, finished in textured stucco, is capped by a flat roof.
The primary façade is asymmetrical in design with the metal entrance door set underneath a
cantilevered boxed overhang. Fenestration consists of variously-sized multi-paned metal casement
windows of dimpled, opaque glass with inset wire meshing set in recessed casements with a slightly
projecting sill. This building was used for musical instruction in the past, but its current use was not
determined.

Central Plant Building. Built in 1958 and located approximately 5 feet to the west of the
Administrative Building and 10 feet south of the Music Building, this two-story, 741-square-foot
wood-framed building is designed in a vernacular adaptation of the International Style. The
rectangular-plan building, finished in textured stucco, is capped by a flat roof. Each of the façades is
symmetrical in design with the original doors on the north and west façades. Fenestration consists of
tall, narrow, multi-paned metal casement windows of dimpled, opaque glass with inset wire meshing
set in recessed casements with a slightly projecting sill similar to the Music Building. The west façade
door has a rectangular transom light of dimpled, opaque glass. Currently this building is used to store
HVAC machinery and electrical equipment

                                       ELIGIBILITY EVALUATIONS




This section presents the historical and architectural context of the project site, then evaluates the
resources in the project site under the CRHR significance criteria.

Historical Context
This section presents the historical context within with the built environment resources in the project
site were evaluated for eligibility.

Emeryville. The project site is within the Rancho San Antonio land grant, which was originally
granted to Luis Maria Peralta on August 3, 1820, for his service to the Spanish government. His
44,800-acre rancho included what are now the cities of Emeryville, Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda,
Piedmont, and a part of San Leandro. Peralta's land grant was confirmed after Mexico's
independence from Spain in 1822. In 1842, Peralta's son Vicente received the southwestern portion
of the rancho lands, which included today's Emeryville, central and north Oakland, and Piedmont.
Alta California was annexed by the United States in 1848, and Peralta's land title was confirmed by
the United States government in 1856.

In 1859, Joseph Emery purchased 185 acres of an unincorporated tract north of Oakland that would
become the city of Emeryville. At that time, Emeryville contained two major thoroughfares, Park and
San Pablo Avenues, and a section of the Southern Pacific railroad that paralleled the bayshore. Emery
built a Victorian mansion on the corners of San Pablo and Park Avenues, and then subdivided and
sold the remainder of his land. In 1871, Emery built the San Pablo Avenue Horse Car Railroad which
connected Oakland with Emeryville, attracting new residents and development to Emeryville
(Hausler 1994:1).

Emeryville's first major development was the Oakland Trotting Park in 1871. The popularity of the
race track attracted businesses including saloons, restaurants, hotels, and bordellos to the surrounding
area. By 1874, the Northern Railway connected Oakland to Martinez through Emeryville. The same
year, Shell Mound Park, a picnic area and resort with a dance hall, was developed on top of the
Emeryville Shellmound. The park drew local residents and weekend visitors from around the Bay
Area. Emery Station, at the foot of Park Avenue, and Shellmound Station provided rail access to the
park and to the race track (Hausler 1994:6-13). In 1896, the Oakland Trotting Park was replaced by
the California Jockey Club.

Business investors and concerned citizens, including Joseph Emery, proposed incorporating
Emeryville in 1896. The group was interested in maintaining control of profits and taxes related to
their investment. Local voters agreed and the City of Emeryville was established (Hausler 1994:6-13).

Despite the closure of the race track in 1911 and Shell Mound Park in 1924, Emeryville continued to
develop and prosper. In the 1920s, the City's Board of Trustees promoted Emeryville's prime
location on San Francisco Bay as an excellent location for business enterprises, and its proximity to
major cities, ports, and transportation. Coupled with the offer of reduced taxes, Emeryville became

the home of industrial businesses. By 1935, 100 manufacturing plants operated within the city
(Walker 2004:18). The construction of the Bay Bridge connected Emeryville with San Francisco in
1939 and led to further industrial growth. Paint factories, steel mills, and other heavy industries
continued to thrive during and after World War II as millions of migrants headed for war industry-
related jobs on the Pacific Coast. This migration is one of the most powerful demographic and spatial
realignments of Americans in the 20th-century (Johnson 1993:2). Emeryville and other East Bay
communities became centers for defense industries and experienced rapid growth, comparable to the
Gold Rush and the period of dislocation after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire (Corbett
1998:52).

Following the war, defense industry workers wanted to move out of their housing projects and other
temporary accommodations and into something more permanent: a new home. Tens of thousands of
returning veterans were drawn to California's climate and plentiful jobs. The result was a housing and
civic facilities crisis (Johnson 1993:213-215). Middle-class subdivisions, built on former agricultural
land, were quickly inhabited by veterans and their growing families, who were enabled to buy homes
with generous government-insured home loans (Burns et al. 2001:2-8, Wollenberg 1985:262-263).
Today, Emeryville is less reliant on industry and is restoring former factories and converting them via
adaptive reuse into work/live spaces. Service, shopping facilities, educational, entertainment, and
biological and other high tech industries are the new industries of this urban residential city.

Post-World War II School Construction. Just as these new and returning Bay Area residents
needed homes, their children needed schools. Nearly seven million war babies entered the first grade
in 1948-1949, which strained existing school facilities. This phenomenal growth concerned school
boards, parents, and taxpayers (Architectural Forum 1949:81). Estimates of public school enrollment
predicted a one-third enrollment increase between 1949 and 1960, and that 400,000 new classrooms
would be needed to accommodate the baby boom. Many existing classrooms needed renovation as
few were built or maintained during the Depression and the war (Perkins and Cocking 1949: 198,
203).

This construction boom coincided with a shift in American architecture, which was transitioning from
classical and medieval revival styles toward internationalism. A generation earlier, school designers
had claimed that buildings that referenced traditional styles had a positive effect on young people,
inspiring them to emulate the best values of the past (Donovan 1921; Pugh 1927). By the late 1940s,
however, traditionally styled buildings were seen as stifling, dark, costly, and poorly suited to new
education techniques that emphasized group work and classroom flexibility. Architects wanted the
400,000 new classrooms to reflect the new values of the atomic age. Modern architects argued that
children could best learn to live as happily as possible in large, well-lit classrooms (Architect and
Engineer 1953, Architectural Record 1948, 1949). Characteristics of these modern school buildings
include:

·    Large windows, often extending from ceiling to floor, in plane with walls;
·    Single-story construction with single- or double-loaded corridors;
·    Individual exit doors opening each classroom to the outdoors;
·    Bright trim and finish colors;
·    Simple rooflines;

·    Overhangs, layered ceilings, window coverings, and other devices to diffuse direct light;
·    Substantial surrounding space for playgrounds, outdoor education, and future school building
     expansion; and
·    Modular structural design, often employing steel or laminated wood beams extending the full
     width of each classroom.

Some historians have interpreted these architectural and design features negatively as factory-like,
cookie-cutter architecture, commenting that these characteristics suggest a shift from the classical,
humanistic notion of education to a narrower concern with preparing workers for modern industry
(Butchart 1986:97). Modern-period school architects, predictably, held a different view. They saw
nothing wrong with adapting factory architecture to schools because they associated factories with
cleanliness, efficiency, and the important role they played in the Allied victory (Corbett 1998:51-53).
Furthermore, a design that offered an assembly line-like efficiency was critical if the 400,000
necessary classrooms were to be built to alleviate overcrowding. Preparing children for the world of
work was regarded as appropriate by school designers, school board members, and parents.

Relatively few postwar schools remain intact today. As their designers intended, these adaptable
buildings changed along with the times and needs of their communities.

Project Site and Vicinity. In 1902, the project site was occupied by a large, single-family house
facing San Pablo Avenue on a large, open, estate-like parcel with several detached buildings to the
rear of the property. To the west of the house, and adjacent to the project site, was the Oakland
Trotting Park. By 1911, the Trotting Park became the New California Jockey Club Race Track, and
the residential building at 47th Street and San Pablo Avenue was removed and the property cleared of
buildings, structures, and objects. In the 1930s, the site of the Oakland Trotting Park became the
Emeryville Motorcycle Speedway (City of Emeryville 2012; Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps 1902,
1911, 1951; Thompson & West 1878).

After Emeryville incorporated in 1896, a push to construct civic buildings began. For most of
Emeryville's history the project site was associated with civic uses and not dense residential, as in the
neighborhood to the north and east. This could be partly to do with foreseeable land use conflicts
associated with the noise from the nearby motorcycle race track and baseball fields, which
discouraged residential development and created a de facto area for libraries, schools, and repair
shops and storage yards for the Key Streetcar System and later the AC Transit across 47th Street
(Nationwide Environmental Title Research, LLC (NETR) 1931, 1946, 1959, 1968; Sanborn Fire
Insurance Company 1911, 1951, 1953, 1967).

In 1920, a two-story, classical revival-styled school was built at the northwest corner of San Pablo
Avenue and 47th Street, which later became Emery High School (City of Emeryville 2012). In 1949,
a public library was constructed in the project site, which is now the District Administrative Offices at
1727 San Pablo Avenue. The school was demolished and replaced in 1966 by Buildings 1 and 2, the
one-story, L-shaped, Brutalist-styled Art Lab/Computer Lab and the Library/Offices/Classrooms
designed by notable schools architect, Corwin Booth. The school was later renamed Emery
Secondary School and currently matriculates students grades 7 through 12 (Sanborn Fire Insurance
Company 1951).

Architectural Context
International. Architecture in the project site closely followed trends elsewhere in California during
the twentieth century. The buildings in the project site that are over 50 years old, consisting of the
District Administrative Offices; the Music Building; and the Central Plant Building, are associated
with the International Style, a design trend that began in Europe during the mid-1920s by Walter
Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, and the Bauhaus School. The essence of this style was to create an
entirely new design without historical or nationalist roots; a design for the Machine Age, easily
replicated worldwide. Fleeing Hitler's Germany, Gropius and others brought the Internationalist Style
to the United States where it became popular. The International Style is most famous in the design of
skyscrapers using a skeleton of structural steel with various wall claddings, usually glass. In a general
sense, an International-styled building had a flat roof with shallow or no eave or overhang across the
top, no decorative detailing on the façade, smooth, unadorned wall surfaces, an asymmetrical façade,
cantilevered sections jutting out from the wall and fenestration consisting of metal casements usually
set flush with the wall (Gelernter 1999: 260-270; McAlester & McAlester 2003:468-473).

Brutalism. The buildings in the project site that are less than 50 years old, consisting of the Art
Lab/Computer Lab; the Library/Offices/Classrooms; the Cafeteria/Kitchen/Offices/Classrooms; the
Gymnasium; and the Girls and Boys Locker Rooms, are expressions of Brutalist architecture, a style
prominent in the United States between 1950 and 1970 and used in many California public schools
and civic buildings. The International Style was popular following World War II but gave way to
other architectural designs. Of these, Brutalism became popular among younger architects as a more
aggressive design for public buildings than the Bauhaus-derived International School. The design
features of the Brutalist architectural style (known as béton brut in French) was popularized by
French Integrationist/Modernist architects Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, and others. Brutalist
architecture was an attempt to redesign how people interacted with their environment. The style
proved popular among young architects of the time, who were keen to work with raw concrete
favored economy in materials and "honesty" in design, Brutalist architects favored working with
fixed-paned windows, full-height walls of poured concrete with wall surfaces often textured with
ribbed wall finishes or faced with exposed aggregate. Brutalism's blockish arrangement, stressing
linear patterns and arranged in large chunks, evokes a cold, fortress-like feeling (Gane 1970:88;
Gelernter 1999: 264-265, 277; Koyl 1955:53, 1962:68; San Francisco Chronicle 2008; Wiseman
2000:187-188).

Application of Significance Criteria
This section applies the CRHR significance criteria to the resources in the project site. The project
site does not contain any built environment resources that were previously listed or determined
eligible for inclusion in the CRHR or in a local inventory of historical resources.

Emeryville School Administration Office District. The Emeryville School Administration Office
District (District) consists of three elements built 1949-1958: the District Administrative Office
Building, the Music Building, and the Central Plant Building. The District Administrative Office
Building was originally the Emeryville City Library, later incorporated with the Music Building and
Central Plant Building. These buildings possess basic International Style architecture. The period of
significance for this historic district is 1949-1958, which, according to information from the Emery
Unified School District, Sanborn Fire Insurance Company maps, historical aerial photographs, and
local histories encompasses the dates these buildings were constructed.

                                                                  EMERYVILLE, ALAMEDA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA




Criterion 1: Is it associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of California's history and cultural heritage?
     Research indicates that although the District is associated with the development of educational
     facilities in Emeryville, an event that has made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
     local history, it did not have a specific, important contribution fulfilling that demand. Moreover,
     the buildings themselves have been altered to accommodate different uses and the surrounding
     area (i.e., the modern Emery School campus) has virtually enveloped these buildings and hidden
     them behind a metal screen and a Brutalist concrete roof and screen walls.

Criterion 2: Is it associated with the lives of persons important in our past?
     Research did not indicate any association the District has with the lives of persons significant in
     our past.

Criterion 3: Does it embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or represent the work of an important creative individual, or possess high artistic
values?
     The District embodies the general characteristics of International Style architecture, an
     architectural style well represented in the existing building stock of Emeryville, Berkeley,
     Oakland, and the East Bay. Research and field observations indicate that they do not represent the
     work of a master nor do they possess high artistic value.

Criterion 4: Has it yielded, or may it be likely to yield, information important to history?
     The International Style has been well documented in architectural literature, and information is
     readily available from those sources; there are no indications that study of the District would
     result in new information about construction techniques or the International Style. For this reason
     the District will not yield information important to history.

     Integrity Assessment. Integrity is the ability of a property to convey its historical significance.
     Due to the lack of historical significance, an assessment of the District's integrity is not warranted
     and was not conducted as part of this analysis.

     Eligibility Conclusion. The District is not a representative example of the International Style,
     which is common in the San Francisco Bay area and statewide. Other, better examples of
     International Style exist in the Bay Area. Due to a lack of historical significance, the District does
     not appear eligible for inclusion in the CRHR, nor does it qualify as a historical resource for the
     purposes of CEQA. Please see Appendix A for detailed building information and photographs.

                                                   CONCLUSION




Background research and field reviews identified one resource in the project site: the Emeryville
School Administration Office District (District), which comprises three single-story, International
Style buildings constructed between 1949 and 1958: the Administration Building (1949); the Music
Building (1957); and the Central Plan Building (1958). Due to a lack of significance, the District does
not appear eligible for inclusion in the CRHR, nor does it otherwise constitute a historical resource
for the purposes of CEQA. No additional study or protection of the District is warranted.

Background research and field survey did not identify any archaeological deposits in the project site.
The project site, however, is currently developed with built-environment features and the native
ground surface is overlain by fill. Due to the project site's proximity to several recorded prehistoric
archaeological sites along Temescal Creek, historical archaeological site CA-ALA-634H, and
development of the project site by at least 1902, there is a high possibility of identifying subsurface
archaeological deposits and human remains during project ground-disturbing activities.

There is also the possibility of encountering significant paleontological resources (fossils) in the
Pleistocene alluvium underlying the project site at an unknown depth. Please see the Recommenda-
tions section for additional information.

                                              RECOMMENDATIONS




Prehistoric and historical archaeological deposits may underlie the project site. Construction
personnel should be alerted to the possible presence of archaeological deposits and human remains,
and an Archaeological Monitoring and Evaluation Plan should be developed before, and implemented
during, project ground-disturbing activities. The Archaeological Monitoring and Evaluation Plan is
described below.

Should fossils be identified during project ground-disturbing activities, these should be treated in
accordance with the Accidental Discovery recommendations below.

Archaeological Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
Archaeological monitoring should be conducted for implemented for construction-related ground
disturbance below soil that is demonstrated to be fill in the project site. The monitoring should be
done in accordance with, and as guided by, an Archaeological Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
(AMEP) prepared and implemented for the project. The purpose of the AMEP is to ensure that
significant archaeological deposits discovered during construction are identified, evaluated, and
appropriately treated through the use of a pre-established research design and field evaluation
strategy, consistent with the requirements of CEQA Guidelines §15126.4 (b)(3)(C). The AMEP
should be approved by the District well in advance of construction, and its implementation should be
made a condition of the issuance of a grading or building permit for the project. The AMEP should be
prepared by professionals who meet the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications
Standards in historical archaeology and prehistoric archaeology.

The AMEP should include a construction monitoring component and an evaluation component. The
monitoring component of the AMEP should refine the archaeological sensitivity of the project site to:
(1) identify areas that will be subject to monitoring; (2) define the frequency of monitoring; and (3)
identify those areas with little to no possibility of containing intact deposits. This assessment should
focus on the project site's land use history based on historical maps and photographs, past site
improvement/utilities construction plans, historical documents, and soils/geotechnical information.
The possibility for encountering human remains during construction should also be addressed by
consultation with the appropriate descendant groups.

The evaluation component of the AMEP would guide fieldwork if archaeological resources or human
remains are identified during monitoring. The purpose of this component is to establish an evaluation
process to shorten the time necessary to respond to and evaluate the significance of discoveries made
during archaeological monitoring. The evaluation component should contain a field study and
technical analysis work plan to guide the methods and procedures to be used during the significance
evaluation. The treatment of human remains during the evaluation process should be addressed, and
procedures for the respectful treatment of such remains should be developed through consultation
with descendant communities prior to the final draft of the AMEP.

Accidental Discovery of Paleontological Resources
Should paleontological resources be encountered during project subsurface construction activities, all
ground-disturbing activities within 25 feet should be redirected and a qualified paleontologist
contacted to assess the situation, consult with agencies as appropriate, and make recommendations for
the treatment of the discovery. If found to be significant, and project activities cannot avoid the
paleontological resources, adverse effects to paleontological resources should be mitigated.
Mitigation may include monitoring, recording the fossil locality, data recovery and analysis, a final
report, and accessioning the fossil material and technical report to a paleontological repository. Public
educational outreach may also be appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment, a report
documenting methods, findings, and recommendations should be prepared and submitted to the
District for review, and (if paleontological materials are recovered) a paleontological repository, such
as the University of California Museum of Paleontology.

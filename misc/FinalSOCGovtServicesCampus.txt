                                                     Town of Chapel Hill: Traffic Impact Study
                 Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


I. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Project Overview

An expansion of the Southern Orange County Government Services Campus, located along
Homestead Road to the west of N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) is being proposed in
Chapel Hill. The project proposes to add additional government services facilities to the existing
site parcel, including potential additions to existing buildings and new campus buildings.
Figure 1 (found in Appendix A) shows the general location of the site. The project is
anticipated to be built in stages, with the first phase fully complete by 2018. This report
analyzes the Phase 1 build-out scenario (adding 50,000 square feet of floor area) for the year
2019 (one year after anticipated completion), the no-build scenario for 2019, as well as 2013
existing year traffic conditions. The report also contains a planning-level analysis of traffic
impacts for an ultimate 300,000 square foot expansion in the year 2040.

The proposed site concept plan shows a realignment of the full movement access driveway that
currently connects to Homestead Road and a provision for a new access connection east of the
existing driveway. No other vehicular access connections are proposed. Figure 2 displays the
preliminary concept plan of the Southern Orange County Government Services Campus and
nearby land uses and roadways. The existing on-site facilities include the Robert and Pearl
Seymour Center and the Southern Human Services Center which total 52,000 square feet of
floor space and provide 238 parking spaces in two surface lots.

B. Site Location and Study Area

This report analyzes and presents the transportation impacts that the Southern Orange County
Government Services Campus will have on the following intersections in the project study area:

      Homestead Road and Seawell School Road
      Homestead Road and Weaver Dairy Road Extension
      Homestead Road and Existing Human Services Center Site Driveway
      Homestead Road and Proposed Site Driveway
      Homestead Road and Northern Park Drive
      Homestead Road and NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard)

The impacts of the proposed site at the study area intersections will be evaluated during the
AM, noon, and PM peak hours of an average weekday. The following study is based on
background traffic for the existing year, 2013, the year following the estimated site phase 1 build
out year of 2018, as well as the estimated net site-generated traffic produced by the expanded
government services facilities.

There are numerous Town-approved future developments in, or just beyond, the immediate
project study area that were considered to be constructed by 2019 and may generate additional
background traffic. An area-wide ambient future traffic growth percentage of 1.0 percent per
year was applied to the existing volumes, based on historical average annual daily traffic
(AADT) growth rate data provided by the Town of Chapel Hill and NCDOT, and consistent with
recent study area traffic impact studies.

                Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


C. Site Description

The Southern Orange Country Government
Services site currently contains a senior center,
human services center, and the Interfaith Council
Project Home Start facilities. It borders Carolina
North property to the west and south and by
multi-family residential development to the east.
Additional residential subdivisions, commercial
and institutional development are present along
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and
                                                         Existing Human Services Building
Homestead Road in the project study area.

                                                  The site expansion has frontage along
                                                  Homestead Road and will border the Horace
                                                  Williams Trail greenway (under construction)
                                                  to the west. All vehicular access will utilize
                                                  Homestead Road. An additional access
                                                  driveway is proposed along Homestead
                                                  Road along an easement to the east of the
                                                  site parcel. The proposed site plan, shown
                                                  in Figure 2, indicates all parking will be
                                                  accommodated on-site, through the use of
                      Existing Seymour Center existing surface parking facilities and
expansion into new designated development areas on-site. Internal driveway circulation
improvements, potential transit stops, pedestrian and bicycle improvements, and a greenway
connection are shown on the concept plans.

D. Existing and Proposed Uses in Vicinity of Site

The land uses and development in the study area are primarily residential and institutional, with
some higher density commercial areas located along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. The
Existing Land Use Plan shown in the 2020 Town of Chapel Hill Comprehensive Plan and
adopted June 25, 2012, indicates that the proposed site is designated as “institutional”. The
Future Land Use Plan, that is also a part of the Town Comprehensive Plan, indicates that the
parcel would continue to be designated as “institutional”. The recently updated Comprehensive
Plan also indicates that this parcel is a “Future Focus Discussion Area”. The parcel is currently
zoned “R-5-C” – delineating high density residential use (15 units per acre) with conditional
standards.

E. Existing and Committed Surface Transportation Network

Roadways
The Southern Orange County Government Services Campus project study area features
several major arterial roadways serving areas throughout the Town of Chapel Hill and points
beyond, as well as a number of collector and local access streets. Table 1, on the following
page, summarizes pertinent information on the study area roadway facilities.

Figure 3 shows the existing lane configuration, traffic control, and speed limits for these study
area roadways. Detailed descriptions of several of the major study area roadways are as
follows:

       N.C. Highway 86 (Martin Luther King Jr, Blvd) is a principal arterial in the study area,
        serving areas from I-40 (via Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) to downtown Chapel Hill
        and the US 15-501 corridor to the south. In the study area vicinity, Martin Luther King, Jr.
        Boulevard is a four lane divided cross-section north of Homestead Road and a five-lane
        undivided section (with two-way left-turn lane) south of Homestead Road. There are
        multiple driveway access points along the roadway and several major street
        intersections. No on-street parking is permitted along N.C. 86 in the project study area.
        Several bus stops are located along the facility. The posted speed limit is 35 mph in the
        study area.

       Homestead Road is a minor arterial that connects areas of west and north Chapel Hill.
        In the study area, Homestead Road is an undivided facility with sections near NC 86 that
        feature a continuous center left-turn lane with a 35 mph speed limit. It transitions to a
        two-lane undivided facility west of the existing Southern Orange County Human Services
        Center. Several bus stops are located along the facility.

       Seawell School Road and Weaver Dairy Road Extension are collector streets that
        provide access to residential neighborhoods along Homestead Road. Both are two-lane
        facilities, with Weaver Dairy Road Extension having a raised center median. The posted
        speed limit is 25 mph on the Weaver Dairy Road Extension and 35 mph on Seawell
        School Road. On-street parking is permitted in some areas on Seawell School Road.

       Northern Park Drive is a local access street for traffic accessing Homestead Park and
        the Homestead Aquatic Center. It features sidewalk and a two-lane undivided cross-
        section with a 25 mph speed limit. On-street parking is not permitted.

The project study area along Homestead Road features a mixture of signalized and
unsignalized intersections. The N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) corridor features
coordinated signal operation for weekday peak hours.

Bicycle Routes and Sidewalks
Specific bicycle facilities are present in the immediate study area, with striped bicycle lanes in
both directions along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard north of Homestead Road. A bicycle
lane is also present on Weaver Dairy Road Extension in the northbound direction. Pedestrian
sidewalk is found along both sides of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard through the study area.
Additional connectivity exists along the Homestead Road corridor from Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard to Northern Park Drive (both sides) and past the existing Southern Orange County
Human Services Driveway (south side of Homestead Road). Sidewalk is also present on one
side of the Weaver Dairy Road Extension and Northern Park Drive, and along Seawell School
Road south of Homestead Road. Crosswalks and pedestrian signals are present across Martin
Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at the Homestead Road intersection. A crosswalk is also present at
the Homestead Road and Northern Park Drive intersection in the study area. The Horace
Williams Trail Greenway is currently under construction just south of the Weaver Dairy Road
Extension. Figure 4 displays a schematic of existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the
project study area.

Transit Routes
Current Chapel Hill Transit (CHT) Routes A, NS and T serve the project study area along NC 86
(Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Homestead Road with weekday bus service (T Route
also provides Saturday service). Several bus stops, with a range of amenities (shelters,
benches), are present in the study area. Table 3 details the three current CHT routes serving
the study area. Most buses run on 15, 30, or hour headways during weekday peak service
periods. The A Route currently provides service directly within the Southern Orange County
Government Services Campus.

Triangle Transit provides regional bus service to the immediate study area via the 420 Route
that runs along NC 86 between Chapel Hill and Hillsborough. Service for this route occurs at 30
minute headways during peak weekday periods. Triangle Transit also provides express bus

Figure 5 displays transit routes and bus stops that currently exist in the project study area.
Transit trips are accounted for in the Southern Orange County Government Services Campus
site in the following sections of this report, as the proximity and frequency of transit service
directly within the existing/proposed site will account for a measurable portion of site trips.

Recommended/Committed Surface Transportation Improvement Projects
There are no committed/programmed NCDOT State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP) projects, Town of Chapel Hill transportation improvement projects, or private
development-related projects to improve roadway facilities in the study area that are expected to
be complete by 2019. Several development projects near the study area have recommended,
as part of their traffic impact study reports, reoptimization of traffic signals along the NC 86
(Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) corridor.

There is currently a greenway project, the Horace Williams Greenway Trail, under construction
immediately west of the proposed site. It is expected to be complete in 2014.

There are numerous additional recommended improvements to transportation facilities in
Southern Orange County Government Services Campus project study area that may occur as
the Carolina North development progresses just to the south of the project study area.
However, any additional improvements due to Carolina North were considered post-2019
analysis year for the purposes of this study.

F. Existing Traffic Conditions

Figures 6A and 6B show the existing AM, noon, and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the study
area intersections. The counts used to determine these volumes were conducted in October
2013 for all study area intersections during the weekday periods 7:00 - 9:00 AM, 11:30 AM –
1:30 PM, and 4:00 – 6:00 PM. Weekday traffic count data for the intersections was compiled by
HNTB to provide updated count information for the entire study area. This data, along with all
turning movement count output is found in Appendix B.

Traffic count information shows traffic flows on N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) were
heavy during the AM and PM peak count periods, with southbound flows into downtown Chapel
Hill heaviest in the AM peak and northbound return flows heaviest in the PM peak. Traffic on
Homestead Road was moderate to heavy during the peak commuting periods. Traffic flows
were light to moderate on the remaining study area roadways that function as collector or local
access streets.

Table 4, below, provides a detailed listing of each intersection count, peak hour, and count date.

Services Center driveway for use in the development trip generation characteristics on the
existing campus. Information from this tube count is also found in Appendix B.


II. 2019 BUILD-OUT YEAR +1 CONDITIONS

A. Future Ambient Area-Wide Traffic Growth Estimation

Based on average daily traffic collected by the Town of Chapel Hill and the NCDOT, a yearly
ambient traffic growth rate of 1.0 percent per year was used for the short-term 2019 design year
capacity analyses. This rate is based on previous and anticipated growth trends for this area

from Town of Chapel Hill and NCDOT average daily traffic information for the period 1990-2012.
Figures 7A and 7B show ambient area-wide growth traffic volume projections.

It is important to also note that multiple significant background traffic generating developments
were included in this study, and would likely contribute a significant portion of new trips in the
northern Chapel Hill area between 2013 and 2019, if all of these projects were built and
occupied to their approved land use intensities.

B. Approved Background Development Traffic Estimation

Per information from Town of Chapel Hill staff, 11 Town-approved developments that are either
currently under construction or are expected to be built out and fully operational by the 2019
design analysis year were studied for the inclusion of specific background traffic for this report.
The 11 developments are listed in Table 5, along with their current status and impact to 2019
traffic volumes.

Figure 8 shows the relative location of the approved background developments. Total approved
background traffic volumes (corresponding to the 2019 Without Site Traffic Scenario) for the
Southern Orange County Government Services Campus study area are shown in Figures 9A
and 9B.

Appendix C displays individual background traffic generator peak hour volumes estimates
projected across the project study area. Traffic assignment from the eight specific generator
developments was estimated based on information already compiled for The Edge Mixed-Use
Development Traffic Impact Study (2013 Update) and the Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill
Traffic Impact Study prepared by HNTB in August 2013 and June 2013, respectively.
Background traffic assignment in the project study area that was beyond the original traffic
impact study areas was determined by using current turning movement peak hour volumes and
engineering judgment.

C. Proposed Project Traffic

i. Trip Generation

Projected trips for the proposed government services facility expansion were generated based
on existing traffic count data collected for all three peak hours at the existing access driveway
along Homestead Road and at Southern Orange County Human Services building parking lot
within the existing campus. Due to the limited amount of information available related to land
use types for government services buildings in the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of
Transportation Engineers, 9th Edition, 2013, standard ITE generation information was not used
for this study. No adjustments to trip generation rates (due to internal trips, pass-by trips, transit
trips, pedestrian/bicycle trips) were made, as the vehicular counts taken account for generated
trips that might be made currently by other modes. Trip generation methodologies for estimated
trips due to the proposed site expansion utilize existing trip generation rates per square foot of
existing building sizes on the campus.

Table 6 shows the number of vehicular trips generated by existing Southern Orange County
Government Services Campus during the weekday AM, noon, and PM peak hours of adjacent
streets, based on the generation methodologies and comparisons described above. A peak
hour truck percentage of two percent was estimated for all site-generated traffic. Using the
overall existing campus generation rates found in Table 6, the proposed Phase 1 50,000 square
foot expansion trip generation details are listed in Table 7.

Daily estimates of trip generation were made using similar comparisons to existing traffic
generation to/from the Southern Orange County Human Services building. 24 hour tube count
data was collected from the driveway serving the parking areas of this facility. A daily
generation rate was developed based on existing floor area for the facility and is shown in Table
8. A ratio of the sum of the AM, noon, and PM peak two-hour peak hour turning movement
count totals at the Orange County Human Services Driveway intersection with Homestead Road
to the respective two-hour tube count totals at the Human Services Parking Lot provided the
basis for estimating existing daily traffic volumes to/from the campus. 251 vehicles were
counted during these three peak periods entering/exiting the Human Services parking lot
compared to 531 vehicles total entering/exiting the campus at Homestead Road.

ii.) Adjustments to Trip Generation Rates

    Raw ITE trip generation estimates for daily and peak hour trips are typically adjusted for the
    following factors to reduce raw trip generation estimates to actual estimated vehicular trips
    produced by the Southern Orange County Government Services Campus development. As
    previously stated, the use of actual ground vehicular count information from the existing
    campus was directly applied to develop generation rates for future expansion and already
    accounts for trip adjustment factors, as described below.

                 Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


   a.) Internal Capture
   The land uses proposed for Southern Orange County Government Services Campus
   development would not exhibit the potential for internally captured trips for any on-site uses.
   No additional modifications or reductions were made to trip generation results to account for
   internal capture.

   b.) Modal Split
   The study area is well served by several CHT and Triangle Transit fixed bus routes with
   frequent existing service and also has facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists with good
   connectivity to trip attractions in downtown Chapel Hill and the UNC Main Campus. No
   quantitative estimate was made using these modes in comparing to vehicular trips and in
   the assessment of potential improvements needed for the transportation system to support
   these trips.

   c.) Pass-by Trips
   No pass-by trips were accounted for in this study, since the proposed Southern Orange
   County Government Services Campus is not a typical pass-by trip generator.

   d.) Trip Generation Budget
   Current plans for Southern Orange County Government Services Campus specifically
   designate a phased construction process that includes 50,000 square feet of additional
   development in Phase 1 and an ultimate build-out proposal of 300,000 square feet. This
   analysis considers impacts and recommends improvements for the Phase 1 build-out of
   Southern Orange County Government Services Campus based on peak hour intersection
   operations analysis. Ultimate build-out conditions are analyzed at a broad “planning-level”
   only, and will need to be reanalyzed as specific plans for development are made.

iii.) Trip Distribution

Trip distribution for site-related traffic was based on existing daily and peak hour traffic patterns
to determine the directional peak hour characteristics of traffic to and from the site from the
major study area thoroughfares.

No local trips to/from several lower volume collector and residential streets were estimated,
though the possibility exists that a small portion of trip-making may occur to/from these local
streets. Basic distribution estimates for site expansion utilized existing peak hour turning
movement counts and the direction along Homestead Road that volumes currently utilize.
Figure 11 presents the projected trip distribution traffic percentages for the proposed site in
2019.

iv.) Trip Assignment

Figures 12A and 12B show the corresponding site traffic volumes distributed on the 2019 study
area network. Total volumes into and out of the site correspond to total external vehicular trips
generated, based on the trip generation methodology developed previously. It was assumed
that the proposed site access point along Homestead Road would feature limited access (RIRO
only) for future traffic assignment.

D. Future Traffic Forecasts with the Proposed Development

Figures 13A and 13B display the 2019 Build-out+1 year projected study area traffic volumes
with site traffic added. These traffic volumes represent the aggregate traffic growth over
existing traffic volumes for a) ambient traffic growth, b) specific background development traffic
assignments from those developments, and c) estimated site traffic assignments for Southern
Orange County Government Services Campus. Existing traffic volumes at the Human Services
Driveway access point were also redistributed to account for potential traffic that may utilize the
new proposed access point, using the same assignment distribution assumed for new site trips.


III. IMPACT ANALYSES

A. Peak Hour Intersection Level of Service Analysis

i.) Methodology

Evaluation of traffic operations on suburban arterials is most effective through the determination
of level of service (LOS) criteria. The concept of level of service correlates qualitative aspects of
traffic flow to quantitative terms. This enables transportation professionals to take the qualitative
issues, such as congestion and substandard geometrics, and translate them into measurable
quantities, such as operating speeds and vehicular delays. The 2010 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM 2010) characterizes level of service by letter designations A through F. Level of service A
represents ideal low-volume traffic operations, and level of service F represents over-saturated
high-volume traffic operations. Level of service is measured differently for various roadway
facilities, but in general, level of service letter designations are described by Table 9.

The Synchro Professional Version 7 operations analysis software was used to analyze peak
hour conditions at signalized intersections. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS+ Version
6.0) was used to analyze peak hour conditions at unsignalized intersections. The minimum
acceptable peak hour intersection level of service established for this project is LOS D for
signalized intersections or LOS E for critical movements at unsignalized intersections, or no
increase in delay for signalized intersections operating below LOS D or unsignalized
intersection critical movements operating below LOS E without the inclusion of site traffic. The
following four conditions were evaluated:

Condition 1    - Existing Traffic
Condition 2    - 2019 Traffic without Site Traffic
Condition 3    - 2019 Traffic with Site Traffic Volumes Added
Condition 4    - 2019 Traffic with Site Traffic and Improvements

  Volumes exceed roadway capacity
  Formation of unstable queues
  Stoppages for long periods of time because of traffic congestion

The results of this analysis are based on the procedures presented in the HCM 2010 and
performed with the corresponding capacity analysis software described previously. The
methodology of evaluating each condition for signalized intersections is presented below:

      Condition 1 – Use current Town of Chapel Hill data for the cycle length, splits and
       offsets of individual signalized intersections and report LOS and delay values from
       Synchro.

      Conditions 2 and 3 – Reoptimize the cycle lengths and splits of individual intersections
       in Synchro, if existing timing data does not provide adequate overall intersection LOS.
       Adjust cycle lengths, splits, and offsets, if necessary, if the signal is currently operating in
       a coordinated system. The optimized signal timing information will be held constant for
       both Conditions, to provide a means to compare effects of the proposed site traffic. No
       changes to free run traffic signal inputs were made for Conditions 2 and 3. For several
       intersections that will experience capacity improvements, individual intersection retiming
       and offsets were implemented.

                 Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion

      Condition 4 – Optimize coordinated traffic signals for effects of recommended mitigation
       strategies that change existing/committed changes to lane geometrics. Evaluate the
       potential for different signal phasing schemes (left-turn lag phases, for example). Retain
       existing split minimums and any pedestrian timing values. Recommendations, if
       warranted, will be made to obtain at least LOS D for the intersection as a whole.

The net effect of this process is that direct comparisons, by movement, of delay and LOS
between each of the three conditions are impossible because splits and cycle lengths can and
do change between conditions. The pertinent statistic of this analysis is the overall intersection
level of service and delay. Improvements to deficient intersections in Condition 3 were made by
first attempting to adjust signal operations via changes in cycle lengths, splits and/or with
acceptable adjustments to signal phasing. If that did not produce satisfactory results for all
intersections, geometric improvements to improve intersection capacity were considered for the
deficient intersections. Appendix D contains the Synchro output for all four conditions (where
applicable).

Unsignalized intersections were analyzed directly in HCS. Their results were evaluated on a
per-movement basis, since HCS does not produce an overall intersection level of service for
unsignalized intersections. Thus, intersections with deficient (LOS F) movements in Condition 2
would need to be evaluated for improvements in Condition 3. This methodology differs from
signalized intersections, where one or more movements at an intersection may be deficient in
Condition 2, but as long as the overall intersection level of service does not fall below LOS D, no
intersection improvements are deemed necessary. Appendix E contains the HCS output for all
unsignalized intersections under study.

ii.) 2013 Existing Conditions Results

Table 10 presents the results for the existing year traffic conditions as compiled from field data.
The table lists LOS and delay values for those movements that are in existence at this time. It
also only lists data for individual movements encountering delay at the stop-controlled
intersections (which do not have an overall intersection delay value produced by HCS).

Currently, all study area signalized intersections operate at acceptable levels of service for all of
the analyzed 2013 peak hours. Several signalized intersection movements are over capacity in
at least one peak hour during existing conditions. However, overall intersection delays and LOS
are not significantly impacted by these movements, which may have relatively low traffic
volumes.

During Condition 2 - 2019 Without Site Traffic, all study area intersections are expected to still
operate at acceptable levels of service for all analyzed peak hours, though some areas in the
project study area will experience relatively significant traffic growth, due to the construction of
background traffic developments.        No specific geometric improvements to study area
intersections were recommended (other than signal timing optimization) in previous Traffic
Impact Studies for the background developments. There are no other committed background
improvement projects in the project study area that are expected to be complete by 2019.

iv.) 2019 Build Scenario (Condition 3) Results

Table 12 presents results for 2019 Build-out+1 year estimated traffic conditions, including
impacts of site-related traffic. In general, the addition of site-related traffic will marginally
increase delays at intersections and is not expected to cause additional intersections or critical
intersection stop-controlled movements to drop to deficient levels in the 2019 analysis year.

                   Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


Primary impacts of site-related traffic will be experienced at the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr.
Blvd) and Homestead Road intersection. This high volume intersection will still operate at
acceptable LOS for all three peak hours in 2019, though it will be necessary to potentially retime
the intersection to reduce queues at several approaches. Additional recommended details for
intersection improvements at this location are contained in Section IV.D but were not
specifically analyzed separately in Condition 4.

B.) Generalized Daily Arterial Volume/Capacity (v/c) Analysis

A generalized daily arterial capacity analysis was conducted for existing and 2040 long range
planning-level future conditions. Data for this analysis was taken from the latest version of the
Triangle Regional Travel Demand Model (TRM) Version 5.0. Both generalized peak hour
and/or daily volume/capacity link analyses are more applicable to long range future conditions.
Study area traffic operations are usually better explained by peak hour intersection LOS
methodologies, in most cases, when current and short range data are available.

The latest TRM data includes forecasts for the year 2040, which is the forecast year for the
current approved Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro Metropolitan Planning Organization (DCHC
MPO) 2040 Metropolitan Transportation Plan (2040 MTP). Information for the 2010 base year
model analysis (and comparing to the most current NCDOT 2011 AADT data) was taken from
NCDOT Traffic Survey Unit information and several background traffic impact studies reviewed
for this project. Information from the TRM was used to determine default daily link capacities
and future daily traffic assignments in 2040.

As shown in Table 13, all of the roadways in the study area operate with daily v/c ratios below
0.70 with the input 2010 TRM assignment data. TRM assignment data shows relatively close
correlation with actual NCDOT 2011 AADT data on segments where that information was
available, with the exception of NC 86 north of Homestead Road where recent AADT are
considerably lower than 2010 TRM calibrated base model assignment. Daily capacity
thresholds and excessive congestion may occur when v/c ratios reach 0.90.

                Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


Table 14 displays a comparison between estimated daily 2040 No-Build and Build Scenarios.
The Build scenario was developed by using site trip distribution percentages already developed
for peak hour analyses and proportioning daily site trip generation estimates by the assumed
distribution percentages. Several other factors were included in the 2040 Build daily traffic
volume estimations, including:

      The TRM accounts for projected land use and development intensity changes in defined
       spatial areas known as Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs). The TAZ specific to the location
       of the Southern Orange County Government Service Campus is expected to generate
       7,200 vehicles per day in 2040, compared to 3,400 in the existing model. Thus, the
       2040 model already accounts for some growth in this area that would be attributable to
       the campus. However, this TAZ includes residential and commercial existing and
       potential future developments in areas to the west, east, and south of the campus site.

      To be conservative, daily trip estimates for the ultimate build-out expansion of the
       Southern Orange County Government Services Campus were added to anticipated TAZ
       growth and daily assignment data from the 2040 TRM.

      The 2040 TRM model network includes a capacity expansion along Homestead Road to
       “modernize” the facility – through the implementation of wider lanes, turn lanes, and
       acceleration/deceleration lanes where they are not currently present but may improve
       overall corridor efficiency, which increases daily capacity in this area from 17,500
       vehicles per day to 21,700 vehicles per day.

As shown in Table 14, the TRM daily assignment data predicts a sizable daily traffic volume
increase on most study area facilities, thus driving up daily v/c ratios, unless roadway
improvement projects to add capacity were included in the model. No-Build and Build results
indicate that v/c’s in the 0.85-1.10 range may be expected along NC 86 (MLK Jr. Blvd) in the
area of Homestead Road, indicating potential congestion issues along NC 86.

The Southern Orange County Government Services Campus expansion project would produce
increases in daily site traffic volumes on Homestead Road in the range of 4,000 vehicles per
day, but would not cause overall daily traffic on Homestead Road to exceed the projected 2040
daily capacity. As Table 14 shows, roadway improvements in this area would also slightly
improve daily capacity to mitigate some of the projected demand increases between the No-
Build and Build scenarios.

                 Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


C. Access Analysis

Vehicular site access is to be accommodated at the existing full movement access driveway
connecting to Homestead Road about 900 feet to the east of its signalized intersection with the
Weaver Dairy Road Extension. The driveway has a single inbound lane and left-turn and right-
turn outbound lanes. A second driveway access connection is also proposed along an
easement on the eastern edge of the site parcel, located approximately 500 feet to the east of
the existing Orange Human Services Driveway.

No specific design details related to driveway throat lengths are shown on the concept plans.
The existing internal driveway system is shown to be modified to include a circulating roadway
that would connect the two external driveway access points along Homestead Road. This
circulating roadway would provide access to individual surface parking lots that exist for the
Seymour Center and the Southern Human Services Center, as well as future buildings.

Driveway distances along Homestead from the signalized intersections at Weaver Dairy Road
Extension and NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) are approximately 900 feet and 1,400 feet,
respectively, and are acceptable, based on recommendations of 100 foot minimum corner
clearance as set forth in the 2003 NCDOT Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North
Carolina Highways and the 250 foot minimum along arterial streets specified in the 2005 Town
of Chapel Hill Design Manual. The distance between the proposed eastern driveway connection
and Northern Park Drive is approximately 450 feet and would also be acceptable, based on the
criteria mentioned previously. The proposed spacing between the existing driveway and
proposed eastern driveway (500 feet) is less than the recommended 750 foot spacing along
arterial roadways found in Table 4-A-1 in the Town Design Manual.

Access for pedestrians and bicyclists is adequate in the project study area. Sidewalk is present
on both sides of Homestead Road east of the site and exists along the site frontage on the
south side of Homestead Road. Sidewalk connectivity is not present along Homestead Road to
the west of the site. Crosswalk exists across the NC 86 and Homestead Road signalized
intersection and across Homestead Road at Northern Park Drive near the Southern Orange
County Government Services Campus site. The Southern Orange County Government Services
Campus concept plan shows external improvements for pedestrian or bicycle access to/from the
site via a future 10 foot wide greenway connector to the Horace Williams Trail, which is currently
under construction. No specific bicycle amenities are present along Homestead Road.

D. Signal Warrant Analysis

Based on projected 2019 traffic volumes and current/proposed access plans, no unsignalized
intersections in the project study area would warrant the installation of a traffic signal, based on
the methodology found in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). The
existing Orange Human Services Driveway and Northern Park Drive unsignalized intersections
with Homestead Road were analyzed for Peak Hour Warrants, using the MUTCD
methodologies.

The Peak Hour signal warrant analysis is used as a verification that projected traffic volumes
meet peak hour warrants as a precursor to a more extensive analysis of conditions via
additional data collection for 4-Hour and 8-Hour warrant analyses.

                                                    Town of Chapel Hill: Traffic Impact Study
                Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion

Based on results from the HCS Signal Warrants software application, these intersections would
not satisfy the Peak Hour Warrants in any peak hour in the 2019 with site traffic scenario.
Appendix F contains details for the Peak Hour Warrant analysis.

E. Sight Distance Analysis

In general, sight distance issues entering/exiting the existing Southern Orange County
Government Services Campus driveway would be minimal, considering the fact that Homestead
Road has no horizontal curvature in the vicinity of this existing access location and vertical
curvature at this location is approximately at the apex of a sag vertical curve along Homestead
Road, giving exiting traffic adequate sight distance in both directions.

The proposed eastern site driveway access connection would be located near the crest of a
vertical curve along Homestead Road and would also be located near a section of horizontal
curvature to the east. Limitation of access at this location to right-turns in and out only would
improve any safety concerns due to sight distance limitations at this location.

F. Crash Analysis

Data from the NCDOT Traffic Safety Unit was requested and was provided for the period
10/1/2010 to 9/30/2013 for the segment of Homestead Road from Seawell School Road to NC
86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard). Additionally, information was provided for crashes at all
study area intersections for this time period. Raw crash data can be found in Appendix G.

Homestead Road Corridor
There were 13 crashes reported along the Homestead Road study area corridor between
Seawell School Road and NC 86 over the three year period. In this 1.0 mile segment, crash
types were primarily rear end crashes, with several other crash types occurring. Eight of the 13
crashes were rear-end type crashes. No other crash type had more than two crashes.

Table 15 presents a comparison between the Homestead Road study area crash rates and the
latest North Carolina statewide rates for the period 2009-2011 (compiled by NCDOT Traffic
Safety Unit). Overall, the number of crashes along Homestead in the project study area is lower
than statewide averages for similar facilities (two-lane undivided and two-lane undivided with
continuous center turn lane) in every reported category. The crash severity (number of fatal and
injury crashes) is slightly lower than statewide averages.

Study Area Intersections
In addition to the crash comparison for the project study corridor, individual intersection crash
data for the three year period was provided and results are shown in Table 16.

Crash rate information taken from the crash reports indicates that the higher volume NC 86
(Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) intersection with Homestead Road has the highest rate of
crashes. Very few crashes at the other study area intersection were reported over the three
year period.

G. Other Transportation-Related Analyses

Other transportation-related analyses relevant to the 2001 Town of Chapel Hill Guidelines for
the preparation of Traffic Impact Studies were completed as appropriate. The following topics
listed in Table 17 are germane to the scope of this study.

H. Special Analysis/Issues Related to Project

Based on discussions with Town of Chapel Hill staff, there are no special issues or analyses
beyond the ones already discussed for this proposed site.

                        eastbound existing delineated storage bay lengths if existing signal timings are
                        not adjusted to reflect expected increases in traffic volumes related to those
                        movements.

                        remove turning traffic movements from the eastbound through traffic flow along
                        Homestead Road. No other specific acceleration/deceleration lane issues were
                        analyzed in the project study area.
 Pedestrian and         Existing pedestrian and bicycle access and connectivity is adequate along the
 Bicycle Analysis       Homestead Road corridor adjacent to the site. Sidewalk exists along major
                        thoroughfares to the east of the site, but is currently lacking connectivity to the
                        west of the site. Bicycle lanes extend along NC 86 north of Homestead Road
                        and along the Weaver Dairy Road Extension.

                        Sidewalk connectivity should be extended to the Weaver Dairy Road Extension
                        from the site vicinity along the south side of Homestead Road and pedestrian
                        crosswalk/signalization would improve safety and access at the Homestead
                        Road/Weaver Dairy Road Extension intersection, especially with the completion
                        of the adjacent Horace Williams Trail greenway. The provision in the proposed
                        concept plan of a 10 foot wide paved sidewalk/bicycle facility along the site
                        frontage with Homestead Road will also improve conditions for non-motorized
                        transportation in the site vicinity.

                        site concept plans would allow an internal loop for transit, with buses exiting the
                        site at the proposed eastern driveway connection.

                Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


IV. MITIGATION MEASURES/RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Planned Improvements

There are no Town of Chapel Hill or North Carolina Department of Transportation improvement
projects for study area roadway facilities within the analysis year time frame of 2013-2019.

The Horace Williams Trail greenway is currently being constructed to the west of the Southern
Orange County Government Services Campus and will be complete by 2014.

B. Background Committed Improvements

There are no specific geometric improvements to study area roadway intersections or facilities
related to background private development projects that are expected to be completed between
2013 and 2019. Several traffic impact studies for development projects in and near the study
area recommended signal timing reoptimization for signalized intersections along the NC 86
(Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) corridor by their respective build-out years. It is assumed that
signal timing reoptimization will occur for the NC 86 corridor by the year 2019, whether or not
specifically needed by any of the proposed background traffic generating developments
included in this study.

C. Applicant Committed Improvements

Based on the preliminary site concept plans and supporting development information provided,
there are several specific transportation-related improvements proposed on and adjacent to the
Southern Orange County Government Services Campus. They include the following:

      Construct second vehicular site access driveway along Homestead Road approximately
       500 feet to the east of the existing site driveway.

      Realign the existing site driveway adjacent to the Seymour Center and create an internal
       circulator roadway that would serve the two existing on-site buildings, as well as future
       development areas and their respective parking areas. This circulator is also proposed
       to have transit stops.

      Construct a future 10’ wide paved pedestrian/bicycle path to connect to the Horace
       Williams Trail.

      Construct a 10’ wide paved pedestrian/bicycle path along the site’s frontage with
       Homestead Road.

      Construct internal pedestrian sidewalk and connecting routes between Campus
       buildings.

D. Necessary Improvements

Based on traffic capacity analyses for the 2019 design year, and analyses of existing study area
turning bay storage lengths and site access, the following improvements are recommended as
being necessary for adequate transportation network operations (see Figure 14).



June 2014                                     24
                                                   Town of Chapel Hill: Traffic Impact Study
                Southern Orange County Government Services Campus – Proposed Expansion


   1) Retime the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) and Homestead Road intersection to
      optimize overall capacity given the existing intersection geometrics and progression
      along NC 86. Also, retime the signal to potentially reduce projected vehicle queues on
      the eastbound Homestead Road approach and northbound NC 86 left-turn lanes that
      may exceed existing storage capacity. This improvement is recommended whether or
      not the Southern Orange County Government Services Campus site is developed.

   2) Extend the existing sidewalk, or the proposed 10 foot bicycle/pedestrian path along
      Homestead Road, to the west of the site parcel to the Weaver Dairy Road Extension and
      provide a crosswalk and pedestrian signal head across Homestead Road on the eastern
      leg of the intersection. This will improve pedestrian/bicycle access to the site from
      adjacent areas to the west and north and will also tie into the Horace Williams Trail. This
      improvement is recommended for the Southern Orange County Government Services
      Campus Phase 1 expansion.

   3) Due to potential sight distance issues, limit the proposed eastern site driveway to right-
      turn in/right-turn out access only and construct an eastbound right-turn deceleration lane
      with 150 feet of storage. This improvement is recommended for the Southern Orange
      County Government Services Campus Phase 1 expansion.

Due to the fact that the site is to be expanded in stages beyond the proposed Phase 1
estimated development yield (50,000 additional square feet), it is recommended that this traffic
impact study be revised and updated as additional specific site plans move forward to ultimate
build-out density (300,000 square feet). Additional mitigation improvements may be necessary
due to site traffic impacts beyond Phase 1, depending on future study area traffic conditions at
the time the study is updated.

May 19, 2014                                                                                                Page 3



PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND OPERATING STANDARDS
Two performance measures were used to evaluate traffic operations at the study intersections,
including level-of-service (LOS) and volume-to-capacity (v/c). A brief description of each performance
measure is provided below:

          Level-of-service (LOS) ranks intersections from “A” to “F” based on the average control delay
           experienced by motorists. LOS “A” reflects relatively low vehicle delay times (10 seconds or less)
           while LOS “F” reflects relatively high vehicle delay times (over 50 seconds at unsignalized
           intersections), which is considered unacceptable to most motorists. A more detailed description
           of LOS is provided in Appendix “A.” The appendix also indicates how LOS is measured.
          Volume-to-capacity (v/c) is a ratio that compares the volume of traffic at a particular
           movement/approach to the theoretical capacity of that movement/approach to accommodate
           traffic. A v/c ratio of 1.0 indicates a movement/approach that is operating at capacity. A v/c
           ratio over 1.0 indicates that the capacity of the movement/approach has been (or will be)
           exceeded.

The study intersections are maintained and operated by the City of Roseburg. The City strives to
maintain LOS E or better within the downtown area and a maximum v/c ratio of 0.95.


TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
All LOS and v/c analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM – Reference 1). In order to ensure that the analyses
are based on reasonable worst‐case scenarios, peak 15‐minute flow rates that occurred during the
weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours were used in the evaluation of all intersections. For this reason, the
analyses reflect conditions that are only likely to occur for 15 minutes out of each average peak hour.
The transportation system will likely operate under conditions better than those described in this
report during all other time periods. The analyses were performed using Synchro 7 traffic modeling
software, which implements the methods outlined in the 2000 HCM.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the current physical and operational characteristics of the
roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future conditions later in this
report. Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried the study area in April 2014. At
that time, KAI collected information regarding existing traffic operations and transportation facilities.

Transportation Facilities
Table 1 summarizes the existing transportation facilities within the study area. Additional information
about each facility is provided below.

Roadway Facilities
As shown in Table 1, all of the roadways within the study area currently have two travel lanes and on-
street parking. Washington Avenue (one-way westbound) and Oak Avenue (one-way eastbound) form a
east-west couplet within the study area while Jackson Street (one-way southbound) and Main Street
(one-way northbound) form a north-south couplet. All of the study intersections are currently all-way
stop controlled (AWSC) with the exception of the Kane Street/Washington Avenue intersection, which
is two-way stop controlled (TWSC). Figure 2 illustrates the lane configurations and traffic control
devices at the study intersections.

Pedestrian Facilities
Continuous sidewalks are currently provided along both sides of all roadways within the study area. The
sidewalks are curb-tight; however, street trees planted in tree-wells and on-street parking provides
separation from adjacent street traffic. Marked crosswalks with pedestrian ramps are also provided at
each of the study intersections.

Bicycle Facilities
There are currently no on-street bicycle lanes or shared use pavement markings along the study area
roadways. However, the traffic volumes and travel speeds along the roadways are low enough to allow
some bicyclists to share the roadways with vehicle traffic.

Transit Facilities
Local transit service is provided within the study area by UTrans. Utrans operates eight fixed-route bus
lines within the study area, each of which serve a single stop located in the northeast corner of the SE
Rose Street/SE Washington Avenue intersection. The stop is accessible by pedestrians and offers a
lighted shelter with schedule information.

Traffic Volumes and Peak Hour Operations
Manual turning-movement counts were conducted at the study intersections in March 2014. All the
counts were conducted on a typical mid-week day during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) and evening
(4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak time periods. Given the seasonal variation in traffic volumes within the City of
Roseburg, all of the counts were seasonally adjusted to reflect the 30 th highest hour in a manner
consistent with the Roseburg Transportation System Plan (TSP – Reference 2). Figure 2 summarizes the
year 2014 turning-movement counts at the study intersection for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
hours. Appendix “B” contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.

The weekday a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figure 2 were used to
conduct an operational analysis at the study intersections to determine existing 2014 traffic conditions.
The HCM does not provide a methodology for estimating intersection v/c at all-way stop-controlled
(AWSC) intersections; however, v/c ratios can be reported by approach. Table 2 summarizes the v/c
ratios by approach at each AWSC intersection under existing traffic conditions.

As shown Figure 2 and Table 2, the results of the analysis indicate that all of the study intersections
currently operate acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Appendix “C” contains the
existing traffic conditions worksheets.


FUTURE NO-BUILD TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The future no-build traffic conditions analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system will
operate in 2034 without the proposed lane modifications. This analysis includes traffic attributed to
planned developments within the study as well as general growth in the region, but does not include
any of the proposed lanes modifications.

Year 2034 Traffic Volumes and Peak Hour Operations
A 1.2 percent annual growth rate was applied to existing traffic volumes to account for any in-process
developments as well as general growth in the region. This growth rate was used based on direction
provided by City staff and represents a 24 percent increase in traffic volumes between 2014 and 2034.

The weekday a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figure 3 were used to
conduct an operational analysis at the study intersections to determine future 2034 “no-build” traffic
conditions. Table 3 summarizes the v/c ratios by approach at each AWSC intersection under future “no-
build” traffic conditions.

FUTURE “BUILD” TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The future build traffic conditions analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system will
operate in 2034 with the proposed lane modifications.

Proposed Lane Modification
As indicated previously, the City of Roseburg is planning to remove a single travel lane within the
Roseburg downtown area to accommodate on-street bike lanes and back-in angle parking. Figure 4
illustrates the conceptual layout of the proposed lane modifications. As shown, the proposed lane
modifications include:

                Removal of on-street (parallel) parking along the north side of Oak Avenue between Rose
                 Street and Kane Street and removal of one travel lane along the south side of Oak Avenue
                 between Jackson Street and Kane Street,
                Addition of on-street bike facilities between Rose Street and Kane Street and addition of
                 back-in angle parking along Oak Avenue between Jackson Street and Kane Street,
                Removal of on-street (parallel) parking along the south side of Washington Avenue between
                 Kane Street and Rose Street and removal of one travel lane along the north side of
                 Washington Avenue between Kane Street and Jackson Street,

                Addition of on-street bike facilities along Washington Avenue between Kane Street and
                 Rose Street, and
                Addition of on-street bike facilities and a pedestrian crossing along Kane Street between
                 Washington Avenue and Oak Avenue.
Figure 5 illustrates the assumed lane configurations and traffic control devices at the study
intersections with the proposed lane modifications. As shown, the lane modifications will impact the
lane configurations at all the study intersections.

Peak Hour Operations
The weekday a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figure 5 were used to
conduct an operational analysis at the study intersections to determine future year 2034 “build” traffic
conditions. Table 4 summarizes the v/c ratios by approach at each AWSC intersection under future
“build” traffic conditions.

As shown in Figure 5 and Table 4, all of the study intersections are expected to operate acceptably
during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Appendix “E” includes the year 2034 build traffic
conditions worksheets.

As indicated above, the proposed lane modifications can occur while maintaining acceptable traffic
operations at the study intersections under year 2034 traffic conditions. Per direction provided by City
staff, year 2019, 2024, and 2029 traffic conditions were also analyzed at the study intersection with the
proposed lane modifications. Figures F1 through F3 in Appendix F summarize the results of the
analyses. As shown, all of the study intersections are expected to operate acceptably during the
weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Appendix “F” includes the year 2019, 2024, and 2034 traffic
conditions summaries and worksheets.


ASSESSMENT OF ANGLE PARKING
With the proposed lane modifications along Washington Avenue and Oak Avenue, the opportunity
exists to increase the on-street parking supply with angle parking. Because angle parking require less


Kittelson & Associates, Inc.                                                                         Portland, Oregon
Washington Avenue and Oak Avenue Lane Modifications                                                 Project #: 17616.0
May 19, 2014                                                                                                   Page 12


linear curb length per parking stall than traditional parallel parking, more stalls can typically be
provided on the same block. In addition to an increase in on-street parking supply, angle parking is
commonly used in downtown areas and can also slow or calm traffic. The two most commonly used
types of angle parking are front-in and back-in angle parking. While both front-in and back-in angle
parking are viable options, back-in angle parking offers a variety of benefits over front-in angle parking
that should be considered, including:

                Better visibility: Back-in angle parking allows for better visibility than front-in angle parking
                 since the driver is backing into a parking stall instead of into a travel lane where there is
                 moving traffic. This reduces the potential for collisions and provides a safer environment for
                 the parked vehicle and the vehicles and bicycles in the adjacent travel lane.
                Easier access: Drivers can generally maneuver into back-in parking stalls faster than parallel
                 parking stalls allowing for quicker entry and exits, and therefore shorter time period when
                 the travel lane is blocked.
                Safer for users: Back-in angle parking allows for safer loading and unloading than front-in
                 angle parking from the vehicle doors and the trunk. With back-in angle parking, the vehicle
                 doors channel occupants to the sidewalk and the trunk may be accessed from the sidewalk
                 instead of the adjacent roadway.
                Bicycle friendly: Back-in angle parking creates a more bicycle friendly environment than
                 front-in angle parking since drivers are able to see them easier (and much sooner) when
                 exiting a parking stall. Some cities have reported a decrease in the number of parking
                 related accidents since back-in angle parking was installed.
While back-in angle parking offers many benefits over front-in angle parking, there are a few drawbacks
unique to back-in angle parking that should also be considered:

                Vehicles may overhang the sidewalk and/or back into street furniture. This can be alleviated
                 with proper design of the parking stalls and placement of the street furniture.
                Vehicles may enter the stalls head-in from the opposite side of the street. This can be
                 alleviated with enforcement, signs, and driver awareness and may not be an issue within
                 Roseburg due to the one-way nature of the streets.
                Vehicles may idle in the parking stall, emitting exhaust over sidewalks. Some cities restrict
                 idling for certain periods of time.
We trust that this memorandum provides you with sufficient information related to existing and future
traffic operations within the Roseburg downtown area (with and without the proposed lane
modifications) and the potential benefits of back-in versus front-in angle parking. Please feel free to
contact us if you have any questions.

DESCRIPTION OF LEVEL-OF-SERVICE METHODS AND CRITERIA
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from “A” to “F”.1

Unsignalized Intersections
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service levels associated
with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table A1. A quantitative definition of level of service
for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table A2. Using this definition, Level of Service “E” is
generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

                    Nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
      A             Very seldom is there more than one vehicle in queue.


                    Some drivers begin to consider the delay an inconvenience.
      B             Occasionally there is more than one vehicle in queue.


                    Many times there is more than one vehicle in queue.
      C             Most drivers feel restricted, but not objectionably so.


                    Often there is more than one vehicle in queue.
      D             Drivers feel quite restricted.


                    Represents a condition in which the demand is near or equal to the probable maximum number of vehicles that can be
                     accommodated by the movement.
      E             There is almost always more than one vehicle in queue.
                    Drivers find the delays approaching intolerable levels.


                    Forced flow.
                    Represents an intersection failure condition that is caused by geometric and/or operational constraints external to the
      F              intersection.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is that
drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on the
minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying
acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the HCM
level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

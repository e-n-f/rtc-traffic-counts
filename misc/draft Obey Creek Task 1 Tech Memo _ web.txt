I. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Project Overview

A new mixed-use development, tentatively named Obey Creek, is being proposed in southern
Chapel Hill and will be located along US 15-501 just east of Southern Village. Figure 1, found
in Appendix A, shows the general location of the site and the project study area defined for this
report and agreed-upon by Town of Chapel Hill staff and the Applicant. This technical
memorandum analyzes the 2013 existing year traffic conditions in the project study area and will
be used as a precursor to in-depth studies of future build-out conditions for three development
scenarios and a final preferred alternative scenario.

B. Site Location and Study Area

This technical memorandum defines and analyzes the existing transportation system in the
Obey Creek project study area. The following 28 intersections are part of the project study
area:

·   NC 86 (Columbia Street) & Franklin Street

            Town of Chapel Hill: Draft Traffic Impact Study ­ Existing Conditions
                                                                       Conditions Analysis
                                              Obey Creek ­ Proposed Mixed-Use Development


The impacts of the proposed site at the study area intersections will be evaluated during the
AM, noon, and PM peak hours of an average weekday, so all 2013 base year analyses include
these three peak time periods, as well as a planning-level evaluation of daily traffic flows and
capacities on study area roadway segments.

C. Site Description

The Obey Creek site is currently a heavily wooded
parcel with several small residential buildings and
driveway access points along US 15-501. Site
frontage along US 15-501 would extend from a
point north of the existing Market Street intersection
down to approximately 200 feet north of the existing
Dogwood Acres Drive intersection.             No other
access to any other transportation facilities in the
vicinity of the site parcel currently exists, as land in
the central and eastern portions of the site parcel
features Obey Creek and significant grade and              Obey Creek Site Parcel Looking East
terrain changes.                                           Near Southern Village P&R Driveway

D. Existing and Proposed Land Uses in the
   Vicinity of the Site

The land uses and development in the study area
are primarily the Southern Village mixed-use
traditional neighborhood to the west of the site,
along with several other lower-density residential
subdivisions to the north and east. There are
several parks and schools located within the project
study area, as well.           Some commercial
development and single family homes also are               Obey Creek Site Parcel Looking South
present along the US 15-501 corridor.                      Near Southern Village P&R Driveway

The Existing Land Use Plan shown in the 2020 Town of Chapel Hill Comprehensive Plan
indicates that the proposed site is currently "undeveloped land". The 2020 Land Use Plan, also
a part of the Town Comprehensive Plan, indicates that the parcel is envisioned to be part of a
"Future Focus Discussion Area", with an initial designation of "Low-Density Residential (1
unit/acre)" and a small area designated for commercial uses. There are also designated
locations for a potential school site and a potential affordable housing site shown within the
parcel boundaries. The parcel is currently zoned "R-2" ­ allowing lower density residential
development with up to 4 units per acre.

E. Existing and Committed Surface Transportation Network

Roadways
Obey Creek project study area features several major arterial roadways serving areas
throughout the Town of Chapel Hill and points beyond, as well as a number of collector and
local access streets. Table 1 summarizes pertinent information on the study area roadway
facilities.

                                              Obey Creek ­ Proposed Mixed-Use Development

The project study area features a mixture of signalized and unsignalized intersections. Several
arterial corridors feature coordinated signal operation for weekday peak hours in separate
control zones. Control zones include the downtown Chapel Hill/UNC Main Campus area, US
15-501 south of Fordham Boulevard, along Fordham Boulevard near NC 54, Smith Level
Road/Greensboro Street, and along NC 54 east of Fordham Boulevard. A few study area
signalized intersections currently operate in "free-run" uncoordinated operation where the
signal's cycle length and timings vary throughout the day. Most intersections in urbanized areas
feature crosswalks and pedestrian signal heads.

Bicycle Routes and Sidewalks

Specific bicycle facilities are present in the project study area, with striped bicycle lanes in both
directions along US 15-501 from Market Street adjacent to the proposed Obey Creek site to Mt.
Carmel Church Road / Culbreth Road. Striped bicycle lanes are also present along S.
Columbia Street, Pittsboro Street, and W. Cameron Avenue in the vicinity of the UNC Main
Campus. Additionally, paved greenways extend through the neighboring Southern Village
development and near Morgan Creek, as well as along NC 54 east of Hamilton Road. The
Fordham Boulevard corridor also has widened paved shoulders that permit bicycling.

Pedestrian sidewalk is found along US 15-501 and throughout the Southern Village
development adjacent to the Obey Creek site parcel. Additional sidewalk facilities are present
along many portions of study area roadway facilities and throughout downtown Chapel Hill and
the UNC Main Campus. Crosswalks and pedestrian signals are present across most study area
intersections in at least one quadrant. Figures 3A and 3B display schematics of existing
pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the project study area.

Transit Routes

Current Chapel Hill Transit (CHT) Routes CM, D, G, HU, J, NS, T and V serve various corridors
in the project study area with weekday local bus service. CHT Express Bus Service is provided
on Routes CCX, CPX, FCX, JFX, and PX. Numerous bus stops, with a range of amenities
(shelters, benches), are also present in the study area. Table 3 details the 13 current CHT
routes serving the study area, along with Triangle Transit (TT) Regional bus routes. Several
CHT and TT routes also provide limited weekend service. Additional CHT routes provide transit
connections and service throughout the UNC Main Campus, but do not serve routes within the
project study area.

Figure 4 displays transit routes that currently exist in the project study area, along with park-
and-ride facilities that are proximate to the Obey Creek site. Information shown on the figure
was taken from the CHT 2013 Spring Ride Guide.

Surface Transportation Improvement Projects Currently Under Construction
There are two NCDOT Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) projects in the study area
that are currently under construction. In addition, the University of North Carolina ­ Chapel Hill
has one current construction project affecting traffic flow in the project study area. One
improvement project by a private development is also near completion, per field observations
made in April 2013. Table 4 summarizes the projects.

F. Existing Traffic Conditions

Figures 7A and 7B show the existing AM and noon peak hour traffic volumes for the study area
intersections. Figures 8A and 8B show the existing PM peak hour traffic count volumes for
study area intersections. The counts used to determine these volumes were conducted in the
spring of 2013 for all study area intersections during the weekday periods 7:00 - 9:00 AM, 11:30
AM ­ 1:30 PM, and 4:00 ­ 6:00 PM. Weekday traffic count data for all study intersections was
compiled by HNTB to provide updated count information for the entire study area with the
exception of the following intersections, which were counted in the November 2012 for the
Southern Village Hotel and Apartments Traffic Impact Study, prepared by HNTB.

   ·   US 15-501 & Culbreth Road/Mt. Carmel Church Road
   ·   US 15-501 & Arlen Park Drive/Bennett Road
   ·   US 15-501 & Market Street

In addition to turning movement count data, HNTB collected 48-hour vehicle classification and
volume (tube count) data at six locations along the major study area thoroughfares. This
information was used to compare to NCDOT Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) data and for

PM peak. Similarly, westbound traffic on NC 54 inbound to UNC Main Campus was heaviest in
the AM Peak and eastbound return traffic was prominent in the PM peak. Noon peak flows
were primarily evenly balanced along most corridors. Traffic on other minor arterials such as
Greensboro Street/Smith Level Road and Manning Drive was moderate to heavy during the
peak periods, with distinct directional variation inbound toward downtown Chapel Hill/UNC Main
Campus in the AM peak and outbound from downtown in the PM peak. Traffic flows were light
to moderate on the remaining study area roadways that function as collector or local access
streets.

Volume Balancing
For the intersection capacity analyses, volume balancing was done for through movements
along US 15-501/NC 54 (Fordham Boulevard) between Manning Drive and the NC 54 (Raleigh
Road) interchange, due to considerable variability in turning movement counts at several
locations as well as variability in the turning movement count data to 48 hour vehicle volume
(tube) counts along US 15-501 north of the NC 54 interchange. Since there are few additional
intersections or driveways between the intersections in this area, traffic counts need to exhibit
relatively close agreement between intersections, which was not the case with the raw data.
Flows were balanced to within 100 vehicles upstream/downstream for each intersection. In
other areas of the network, traffic flows were not balanced in the capacity analyses due to
expected variations in the data, such as traffic counts taken on different days, differing specific
peak hour time periods, presence of side streets/driveways in between counted intersections,
etc... In most cases, turning movement count results for adjacent intersections do provide
nearly balanced results.

Construction Project Impacts
Turning movement count data was reviewed for any abnormalities or variations in the vicinity of
the four locations in the project study area where ongoing construction activities were occurring
when counts were taken in late April 2013.

No significant changes were observed in the count data as compared to upstream/downstream
count data that was outside of the construction zones or previously collected data from other
available traffic studies. The ongoing NCDOT STIP U-0624 project on NC 86 (S. Columbia
Street) did affect data collection efforts in that tube counters in this vicinity were removed by the
contractor during the duration of the 48-hour data collection effort.

II. 2013 EXISTING YEAR CAPACITY ANALYSES

A. Peak Hour Intersection Level of Service Analysis

i.) Methodology

Evaluation of traffic operations on suburban arterials is most effective through the determination
of level of service (LOS) criteria. The concept of level of service correlates qualitative aspects
of traffic flow to quantitative terms. This enables transportation professionals to take the
qualitative issues, such as congestion and substandard geometrics, and translate them into
measurable quantities, such as operating speeds and vehicular delays. The 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) characterizes level of service by letter designations A through F.
Level of service A represents ideal low-volume traffic operations, and level of service F
represents over-saturated high-volume traffic operations. Level of service is measured
differently for various roadway facilities, but in general, level of service letter designations are
described by the following in Table 6.

The Synchro Professional Version 7 operations analysis software was used to analyze peak
hour conditions at signalized intersections. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS+ Version
5.6) was used to analyze peak hour conditions at unsignalized intersections.

The minimum acceptable peak hour intersection level of service established for this project is
LOS D for signalized intersections or LOS E for critical movements at unsignalized
intersections, or no increase in delay for signalized intersections operating below LOS D or
unsignalized intersection critical movements operating below LOS E without the inclusion of site
traffic.   These conditions and thresholds will be further analyzed and mitigation
recommendations made for future scenarios that account for No-Build and Build development
scenarios for the Obey Creek site.

The results of this analysis are based on the procedures presented in the HCM 2000 and
performed with the corresponding capacity analysis software described previously. The
methodology of evaluating each condition for signalized intersections is to use current Town of
Chapel Hill data for the cycle length and splits of individual signalized intersections and report
LOS and delay values from Synchro. There are several traffic signals in the project study area
that operate as "free-run" signals at all times. These were analyzed as such in all scenarios.
Input data includes traffic volumes, truck percentages, individual approach peak hour factors,
and pedestrian data for all study area intersections.

Appendix C contains the Synchro output for the three peak hours analyzed for all signalized
intersections in the project study area.

Unsignalized intersections were analyzed directly in HCS. Their results were evaluated on a
per-movement basis, since HCS does not produce an overall intersection level of service for
unsignalized intersections. Appendix D contains the HCS output for all unsignalized
intersections under study.

ii.) Existing Conditions Results

Table 7 presents the results for the existing year traffic conditions as compiled from field data.
The table lists LOS and delay values for those movements that are in existence at this time. It
also only lists data for individual movements encountering delay at the stop-controlled
intersections (which do not have an overall intersection delay value produced by HCS).

hour LOS in the AM peak period, based on existing traffic volume data and coordinated signal
timing information. The specific intersections and issues that contribute to the deficient LOS E
or LOS F operation include the following:

   ·   Smith Level Road and NC 54 Bypass EB Ramps
       Overall LOS E operational issues at this intersection are primarily due to poor operations
       and LOS for the eastbound off-ramp approach. This intersection actually operates in
       conjunction with an adjacent intersection along Smith Level Road that is only 100 feet to
       the south ­ with both intersections operating under one signal controller and phasing
       scheme. This scheme results in some additional clearance times and lost times for
       individual movements, as the phasing concept is utilized to avoid trapping of vehicles
       between the intersections. This also limits the amount of split time available for the
       eastbound off-ramp.

The remaining three intersections are located along the US 15-501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham
Blvd) corridor between Manning Drive and the NC 54 interchange. This area experiences the
highest daily traffic flows of any segments of Fordham Blvd and facilitates heavy inbound AM
peak traffic flows to UNC Main Campus via Manning Drive and Raleigh Road, as well as
commuter traffic that circulates around Chapel Hill.

   ·   US 15-501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) & Manning Drive
       Overall LOS E results from the AM peak intersection capacity analysis at this location
       are due to high eastbound/westbound traffic volumes along the Fordham Boulevard
       corridor that require a high percentage of the overall phase time, which increases delays
       for side street and left-turn movements.

   ·   US 15-501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) & Old Mason Farm Road
       Overall LOS F results in the AM peak hour capacity analysis stem from high through
       traffic volumes on Fordham Boulevard conflicting with an unconventional traffic signal
       and intersection that features five legs and seven signal phases. In reality, phases are
       likely skipped if light traffic volumes at some of the minor street approaches do not have
       a vehicle actuation during a given cycle, with green time given to the main
       eastbound/westbound through movements. However, the non-standard phasing can
       limit overall capacity when those phases are actuated (or if the pedestrian phasing is
       activated by a pedestrian call).

   ·   US 15-501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) & NC 54 (Raleigh Road) Interchange SB
       On-Ramp
       The capacity analysis methodology for this study assumes no right-turns-on-red (RTOR),
       though in reality, these are permitted at most intersections and allow for a better overall
       LOS. At this location, which features dual right-turn lanes for the NC 54 SB loop ramp,
       high volumes on this approach that are not allowed to make RTOR will experience high
       vehicular delay since existing signal timings for this location do not give a high
       percentage of split of the overall signal cycle to this phase (40 out of 170 seconds). For
       this reason, the overall LOS reported in the AM peak is LOS E.

All other remaining signalized and unsignalized intersections in the project study area feature
acceptable LOS, as determined by Town of Chapel Hill thresholds (LOS D overall for signalized
intersections or LOS E for critical movements for unsignalized intersections).

Noon Peak Hour Analysis
Of the 30 intersection locations analyzed, only one signalized intersection currently experiences
a deficient peak hour LOS in the noon peak period, based on existing traffic volume data and
coordinated signal timing information. No unsignalized intersection critical movements
experience any operational LOS issues. Noon peak traffic flows in the project study area are
generally lower and more directionally balanced than AM and PM peak flows. At the
intersection of Franklin Street & NC 86 (Columbia Street), noon peak overall LOS is LOS E,
based on existing traffic volume, pedestrian, and signal timing information. Several factors
combine to reduce traffic capacity at this intersection, the largest being the high pedestrian
volumes at all four quadrants. Additionally, low posted speed limits, the presence of on-street
parking, high transit volumes in all directions, and relatively high truck percentages all reduce
throughput at the intersection.

PM Peak Hour Analysis
Of the 30 intersection locations analyzed, five currently experience deficient overall peak hour
LOS in the PM peak period, based on existing traffic volume data and coordinated signal timing
information.

   ·   Franklin Street & NC 86 (Columbia Street)
       The same issues described previously that reduce traffic capacity in the noon peak hour
       also continue in the PM peak hour at this intersection. There are nearly 1,000
       pedestrians total crossing at least one quadrant of the intersection, coupled with the
       presence of buses and bus stops in the vicinity, on-street parking, bicycles and other
       heavy vehicles all contribute to reducing vehicular throughput.

   ·   NC 86 (S. Columbia Street) & NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) WB Ramps
       US 15-501 & NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) EB Ramps
       The operational issues at these two interchange ramp terminal intersections are high
       peak hour traffic demands at the off-ramps at each intersection that conflict with high
       southbound traffic demands along NC 86/US 15-501. In addition, operations at these
       intersections are also impacted by the closely spaced traffic signal at US 15-501 and Mt.
       Carmel Church Road/Culbreth Road.

   ·   US 15-501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) & Old Mason Farm Road
       Overall LOS E results in the PM peak hour capacity analysis stem from the same issues
       experienced in the AM peak hour as detailed previously. High through traffic volumes on
       Fordham Boulevard conflict with an unconventional traffic signal and intersection that
       features five legs and seven signal phases.

   ·   US 15-501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) & NC 54 (Raleigh Road) Interchange SB
       On-Ramp
       Overall intersection LOS E results at this location are due to high right-turn ramp
       volumes conflicting with high southbound through traffic volumes on US 15-501.
       Additionally, the northbound on-ramp was analyzed as a stop-controlled intersection
       (though it signed as a yield-controlled movement, on-ramp traffic has only a short
       acceleration lane to utilize) and results indicate this movement operates at a LOS F in
       the PM peak hour due to lack of sufficient gaps in northbound US 15-501 traffic.

B. Generalized Daily Arterial Volume/Capacity (v/c) Analysis

A generalized daily arterial capacity analysis was conducted for existing planning-level
conditions. Data for this analysis was taken from the latest version of the Triangle Regional
Travel Demand Model (TRM) and current or recent Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data
on selected study area network roadway segments. Daily volume/capacity link analyses are
more applicable to long range future conditions, but were used as a baseline in this report to
compare to future projected traffic growth in subsequent analyses for the Obey Creek
development. Study area traffic operations are usually better explained by peak hour
intersection LOS methodologies, in most cases, when current and short range data are
available.

The latest TRM data includes estimated daily link capacities for major roadway facilities in the
study area. These capacities account for existing roadway characteristics (number of lanes,
operating speeds, access control, presence of traffic signals).

As shown in Table 8 on the following page, two roadway segments currently exhibit daily traffic
volumes that exceed estimated daily capacities (v/c ratio > 1.0) with the input 2011 AADT or
recent 24-hour daily traffic count data (which was converted to AADT with the use of NCDOT
Transportation Planning Branch seasonal traffic adjustment factors). In addition, four other
roadway segments currently experience v/c ratios in excess of 0.85, meaning they are
approaching their daily capacity limit and likely experience periods of congested traffic
conditions. The locations of the congested segments are as follows:

NC 86 (S. Columbia Street) ­ Mason Farm Road to NC 54 Bypass (v/c = 1.23)
This roadway segment is primarily a two-lane undivided facility, which limits daily capacity, but
still experiences high daily and peak hour traffic demands as it serves as a primary connection
between the NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Boulevard) corridor, southern Chapel Hill and areas of
downtown Chapel Hill and the UNC Main Campus. The NCDOT STIP U-0624 project will
provide some additional capacity with the provision of turn lanes along the segment.

W. Cameron Avenue ­ Pittsboro Street to S. Columbia Street (v/c = 1.13)
This short roadway segment is a two-lane facility with closely spaced intersections and traffic
signals that limit the daily capacity.

NC 54 / US 15-501 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) ­ Old Mason Farm Rd to NC 54 (Raleigh Rd)
(v/c = 0.97)
As shown in the peak hour capacity analyses, this corridor experiences considerable peak
period congestion and heavy traffic volumes between Manning Drive and the NC 54
interchange.

US 15-501 ­ NC 54 Bypass EB Ramps to Mt. Carmel Church Road (v/c = 0.94)
This short roadway segment features high daily traffic volumes and closely spaced traffic
signals, with high amounts of turning traffic between the NC 54 Bypass ramps and Mt. Carmel
Church Road.

                                                Obey Creek ­ Proposed Mixed-Use Development


Smith Level Road ­ NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Blvd) EB Ramps to Willow Oak Road
(v/c = 0.91)
The estimated existing capacity of this roadway segment is approximately equal to a two-lane
undivided facility, though there are turn lanes present at intersections and the facility does widen
to multi-lanes through the NC 54 interchange. This area does experience some congested
travel, due to multiple driveway access points and several closely spaced traffic signals.

NC 86 (S. Columbia Street) ­ Manning Drive to Mason Farm Road (v/c = 0.87)
Similar to issues experienced along NC 86 (S. Columbia Street) to the south of Mason Farm
Road, this roadway segment features a two-lane undivided cross-section as a basis to
determine daily capacity, and is impacted by high daily traffic volumes that are accessing
downtown Chapel Hill and the UNC Main Campus.

The State Street Triangle Project team continues to modify the project under review. Hearing the concerns of the
Planning Board at their June 23rd and July 28th meetings, and talking with city officials, neighbors, and other
community members, the project team has reexamined the building and its site in the context of what we heard,
and provided substantial new information for environmental review. With the help of our architects, engineers,
and project team as a whole, we feel that we have a current proposal that will make an important and positive
addition to what is arguably the City of Ithaca’s most important corner.

Starting with the premise that this block, and its surrounding urban core, was the historic center around which the
density of the city grew, we propose to restore the urban vitality that was lost in the wake of 1960s urban renewal.
In fulfilling the intent of the 2013 creation of the CBD-120 (Central Business District), the site is envisioned as a
newly energized urban space on a currently underutilized site. Experientially and visually, State Street Triangle is

intended to be an extension of both the Commons across E. State Street and Restaurant Row on S. Aurora Street.
With a commercial base of 5 new retail/restaurant spaces, the 11-story, 292,880 gsf building has the potential to be
not only one of the city’s primary residential buildings, but one of its most lively commercial buildings as well.

The proposal will help meet the goals of the draft Comprehensive Plan of the City by redeveloping a site where
existing infrastructure already exists, creating greater tax revenue, and enriching the pedestrian and vehicular
experience, particularly as visitors enter Ithaca.

Understanding the importance of the pedestrian experience in this dense, historic cross-roads of the city, we have
addressed recommendations from both Planning Board members and city engineering staff, and working with our
traffic engineers at SRF and our civil engineers at T.G. Miller, have proposed significant potential changes to the
sidewalks, curb lines, and vehicular lanes of the intersection. The proposed widened sidewalks, if realized, will
create an entirely new pedestrian zone related to the new first floor commercial businesses, with potential of
outdoor dining and seating. At this point in schematic, we look forward to discussing the positive impacts such
changes might have if realized, and also look forward to thinking collaboratively about the private/public
realization of those ideas. Furthermore, with an interest in improving the pedestrian experience, the project team
is in conversations with DOT to enhance the landscape along the Green Street slope by bringing in characteristics
of the gorge across the street into the site.

The State Street Triangle Project is a Pedestrian Oriented Development following smart growth urban design
standards. Consistent with the new 2013 zoning by the City of Ithaca, the building will encourage the use of
public transit and alternative modes of transportation. Only a limited number of on-site parking spaces will be
available including handicap access. A four-point parking program is being created for residents who choose to
have a private vehicle, including City of Ithaca owned and managed garages as well as other private options.
Through this approach the City would see an increase in parking revenue. The project is perfectly situated in close
proximity to 3 TCAT stops providing access to many TCAT Bus routes. The project team will work with the
City, County, TCAT, universities, and the Downtown Ithaca Alliance on Transportation Demand Management.

The mix of unit types has changed in order to address the concerns of the community that the project is poised to
be a “student dorm”. The proposal initially had 210 units. The change in units to 240 resulted from converting 10
4-bedroom units into 40 studio apartments. With this adjustment, 140 of the 240, or about 60% of the units, are
studio, 1 bedroom, and 2 bedroom units. This modified unit mix was made to accommodate a mix of people,
including young professionals looking to live downtown.

The project will have on-site amenities including ground floor retail and a fitness center, quiet rooms, and a 2nd
floor courtyard for residents. There will be 24/7 on-site management with a fully staffed building, and
programming provided for residents. The management team consists of a General Manager, Assistant General
Manager, Leasing Manager, Resident Director (a live-in position), 7 Community Assistants, Maintenance
Supervisor, Maintenance Technician, Porter, and Corporate Support including an assigned Regional Manager and
Vice President of Operations.

The proposed materials and mechanicals used in the building will meet or exceed the LEED standards, and the
team is currently exploring the possibility of having the project be LEED certified.

We look forward to working with you and presenting the proposed project at the upcoming Planning Board
meeting. If you have any questions or require additional information, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,




Scott Whitham

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

OVERVIEW
The primary purpose of this report is to identify and evaluate the potential traffic
impacts associated with the proposed State Street Triangle development in the City of
Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York. In addition, pedestrian, bicycle and transit
conditions, considerations and improvements are identified.

In an effort to define traffic impact, this report identifies existing traffic conditions,
future background traffic conditions including area growth, and determines the future
traffic operations that result from the proposed development. Future traffic volumes
and operating conditions are evaluated. Parking generation and demand associated with
the proposed development is evaluated. In addition, an assessment of pedestrian
circulation and safety conditions with the proposed project in operation is provided.

The proposed development site is located on the south side of M.L.K. Jr. Street (State
Street), east of North Aurora Street, in the City of Ithaca, Tompkins County, New
York. The specified parcel of land is bounded by M.L.K. Jr. Street to the north, Seneca
Way to the east, Green Street to the south, and North Aurora Street to the west. The
site is currently occupied by Elmira Savings Bank (the Trebloc Building site).

The proposed State Street Triangle development is a mixed use residential, retail, and
restaurant project located in the heart of downtown Ithaca. Its location is at the eastern
gateway to Ithaca Commons. The proposed development provides approximately 240
apartment units, a 2,797 square foot (SF) restaurant, 9,045 SF of retail space divided
between five separate spaces, a 1,005 SF fitness area, 2,988 SF of an amenity space, and
1,987 SF of leasing space. A retail trash/loading area (5,194 SF) is proposed in the central
courtyard. Parking for the building’s residents and patrons will be provided in the
Cayuga Street Parking Garage. The parking agreement will provide up to 250 parking
spaces for the proposed development. In addition, there will be two to three carshare
vehicles available for use by the proposed project’s users. An access point will be
provided along Aurora Street to be used for loading and unloading of service vehicles
during off-peak hours.

The proposed State Street Triangle development will be constructed and operational
within two years. The City of Ithaca was contacted to discuss any other specific
developments that are currently approved or under construction that would generate
additional traffic in the study area. The Ithaca Marriott and Canopy Ithaca Hotels were
identified and their corresponding trip generation figures have been added to the study
area roadways. Additionally, based upon historical traffic volumes in the CBD area, a 1%
per year growth rate has been applied to existing traffic volumes at the study area
intersections for the two-year build-out period.

This report considers and evaluates the following transportation and operational
conditions:
 Existing traffic conditions during the weekday AM and PM peak hour intervals.

 Future background traffic conditions during the same peak intervals two years into
  the future considering general area growth patterns and nearby developments.
 Parking generation by residents, visitors, and employees.
 New traffic generated by the proposed project.
 Distribution of site generated traffic.
 Development of future traffic conditions during the previously noted peak intervals,
  assuming the site fully built and operational.
 On-site truck deliveries.
 Transportation Demand Management Plan.
 Mutli-modal considerations.

The report that follows details the study procedures, analyses, and transportation
related recommendations associated with development of the proposed development.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the projected site generated traffic volumes and projected levels of service,
the proposed State Street Triangle development in the City of Ithaca will not have a
significant adverse impact on existing traffic operations in the area, as documented in
this report. The analyses contained in this report indicate that the existing
transportation network can adequately accommodate the projected traffic volumes and
resulting impacts to study area intersections with the recommendations outlined. The
following conclusions and recommendations are based upon the results of the analyses:

1. The proposed development is expected to generate approximately 34 entering/73
   exiting vehicles during the AM peak hour and 89 entering/56 exiting vehicles during
   the PM peak hour.

2. Minor signal timing changes are needed at three study intersections:
    Aurora Street/M.L.K. Jr. Street
    East Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street
    Green Street/South Cayuga Street

3. The intersection of M.L.K Jr. Street and Aurora Street should be reconstructed in
   order to remove the northbound right-turn channelized island. The removal of the
   channelized right-turn lane creates a larger space on the southeastern corner of the
   intersection for pedestrians and reduces the total footprint of the intersection. In
   addition, the total crossing distance for pedestrians traversing the northbound
   approach is reduced, making for a more pedestrian-oriented intersection.

4. With the recommended signal timing mitigation in place, the proposed project will
   not result in any potentially significant adverse traffic impacts to the study area
   intersections.

5. Pedestrian walkways and connections to existing sidewalks are included.

6. Bicycle racks are provided on-site.

7. Using the Shared Parking Model, a total of 283 parking spaces are needed. A total of
   57 parking spaces are required for customers, seven parking spaces for employees
   (commercial), and 219 parking spaces are reserved for residents.

8. The parking capacity for the proposed project will be provided primarily in the
   Cayuga Street Parking Garage via 250 reserved parking spaces. The 27 bicycle
   parking spaces provided on-site may reduce the need for vehicle parking spaces.
   Additionally, there were will be two to three carshare parking spaces which can
   equate to a reduction of approximately 15 personal automobiles per carshare
   vehicle.

9. The deficit in parking spaces may need to be provided through the use of the City’s
   other public parking garages (e.g., Tioga Street and Green Street) or available on-
   street parking. It should be noted that other parking adjustment factors may be
   considered to reduce the total demand for parking. Factors such as carsharing,
   demographics, nearby land use mix, employment density, transit accessibility, et al
   have the ability to affect parking demand and optimal parking supply.

10. Truck deliveries are planned on-site during off-peak hours.

I. INTRODUCTION

The primary purpose of this report is to identify and evaluate the potential traffic
impacts associated with the proposed State Street Triangle in the City of Ithaca,
Tompkins County, New York. In addition, pedestrian, bicycle and transit conditions,
considerations and improvements are identified.

In an effort to define traffic impact, this report identifies existing traffic conditions,
future background traffic conditions including area growth, and determines the future
traffic operations that result from the proposed development. Future traffic volumes
and operating conditions are evaluated. Parking generation and demand associated with
the proposed development is evaluated. In addition, an assessment of pedestrian
circulation and safety conditions with the proposed project in operation are included.


II. LOCATION

The proposed development site is located on the south side of M.L.K. Jr. Street (State
Street), east of North Aurora Street, in the City of Ithaca, Tompkins County, New
York. The specified parcel of land is bounded by M.L.K. Jr. Street to the north, Seneca
Way to the east, Green Street to the south, and North Aurora Street to the west. The
site is currently occupied by Elmira Savings Bank (the Trebloc Building site). The site
location and study area are illustrated in Figure 1 - Site Location & Study Area (all
figures are included at the end of this report).


III. EXISTING HIGHWAY SYSTEM

The highway network within the study area is comprised of State arterials, City
collectors and local streets. Operation of the highway network within the study area is
based largely upon two one-way pair systems. East/West Green Street and East/West
Seneca Street (also known as NYS Route 79) complement each other to create the
east-west one-way pair system. East/West Green Street is one-way eastbound between
Fulton Street and East State Street; East/West Seneca Street is one-way westbound
between East State Street and North Meadow Street. NYS Route 79 (Green and Seneca
Streets), the major east-west corridor through the City, is functionally classified as an
urban minor arterial highway. In addition to carrying traffic through the City, these
arterials serve properties and businesses through the Central Business District (CBD)
and border the Ithaca Commons on the north and south.

The other one-way pair is comprised of North/South Aurora Street northbound
between Court and State Streets and North/South Cayuga Street southbound between
Seneca Street and Green Street. Cayuga Street is a two-way roadway between Seneca
Street and Court Street. Both roadways are under the jurisdiction of the City of Ithaca.
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on North Aurora Street was approximately 5,764
vehicles per day (vpd) in 2011, according to the most recent data collected by the New
York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The AADT along Cayuga Street

                                               1                             August 2015
Traffic Impact Study             Proposed State Street Triangle         City of Ithaca, New York




was approximately 8,492 vpd in 2009 according to the most recent data collected by the
NYSDOT.

State Street between North/South Aurora Street and Seneca Way West is a two-lane
roadway with motorists travelling in an east/west direction. The AADT on State Street
was approximately 7,702 vpd in 2010, according to the most recent data collected by
the NYSDOT. On-street metered parking exists on both sides of the roadway between
North/South Aurora Street and Seneca Way.

Tioga Street is functionally classified as an urban collector roadway, under the
jurisdiction of the City of Ithaca in the study area. The highway is oriented in an
north/south direction and consists of two travel lanes in each direction. The AADT on
Tioga Street was approximately 1,859 vpd in 2011, according to the most recent data
collected by the NYSDOT.

Pedestrian Facilities
The City of Ithaca is noted for high levels of walking for daily transport. Sidewalks are
present throughout the CBD and adjacent to the proposed site. Pedestrian crosswalks
and countdown signals are present at signalized intersections. The width of the
sidewalks varies between five feet (along Aurora Street) and eight feet (along M.L.K. Jr.
Street) around the block on which the proposed project is located. As well, a sidewalk
is proposed along the southern boundary of the site to provide a continuous pedestrian
circulation system around the building.

Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle storage racks are located throughout the city. The city is expanding its bicycle
infrastructure in terms of on-street bicycle lanes, shared lane markings (“sharrows”),
and a proposed bicycle boulevard along Plain Street between Elmira Road to Cascadilla
Street. As was previously stated, bicycle storage rack is provided on-site.

Transit Facilities
Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT) has 33 bus routes, operates 22 hours a
day, and services an area-wide population of over 100,000. Ridership has grown every
year since 2006 and accounts for over 10% of daily commuter trips (ACS, 2012).
Specifically to the proposed site, there are six transit stops located within a ¼-mile
(five-minute walk) of the site.


IV. EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

A. Peak Intervals for Analysis
     Given the functional characteristics of the roadways within the study area and the
     land use proposed for the site (mixed-use residential, retail, and restaurant), the
     peak hours selected for analysis are the weekday AM and PM peaks. The
     combination of site generated traffic and adjacent through traffic produces the
     greatest demand during these peak periods.

                                               2                             August 2015

B. Existing Traffic Volume Data
     Vehicular and pedestrian traffic counts were obtained on Wednesday, October 1,
     2014 (all study area intersections, except for Tioga Street) and recorded Thursday,
     December 4, 2014 at the Tioga Street/East Seneca Street intersection. Study
     intersections are as follows:

                1.     State Street (M.L.K. Jr. Street)/Seneca Way West
                2.     State Street/Green Street
                3.     State Street/S. Aurora Street
                4.     East Seneca Street/North Aurora Street
                5.     East Seneca Street/Tioga Street
                6.     Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street
                7.     Green Street/South Cayuga Street

     Traffic counts were conducted between 7:00-9:00 AM for the weekday morning
     peak hour and between 4:00-6:00 PM for the weekday evening peak hour. The
     collective data indicates that during these periods, the peak hours of traffic at the
     study intersections are generally 8:00-9:00 AM and 4:30-5:30 PM.

     All count data was collected on typical weekdays while local colleges, universities,
     and public schools were in session. All traffic volumes were reviewed to confirm
     accuracy and relative balance of the collective traffic counts. During the October
     traffic counts, a detour route was in place due to roadway work being performed
     along Clinton Street impacting the traffic volumes at the study area intersections. In
     order to adjust for the effects of the detour, historical (2006 to 2011) traffic
     volumes at the study area intersections were reviewed to determine the likely
     changes resulting from the detour. Based upon our firms extensive traffic count
     database for downtown Ithaca intersections, and the Tioga Street/East Seneca Street
     turning movement count with no detour route in place, the 2014 existing traffic
     volumes were adjusted to reflect 2014 conditions without the detour in place. The
     final and adjusted existing weekday AM and PM peak hour volumes are reflected in
     Figure 3.

C. Field Observations
     The study intersections were observed during all three peak intervals to assess
     current traffic operations. Signal timing information was collected to determine peak
     hour phasing plans and phase durations during each interval.


V. FUTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL GROWTH

The proposed State Street Triangle development will be constructed and operational
within two years. The City of Ithaca was contacted to discuss any other specific
developments that are currently approved or under construction that would generate
additional traffic in the study area. The Ithaca Marriott and Canopy Ithaca Hotels were


                                                      3                        August 2015
Traffic Impact Study             Proposed State Street Triangle         City of Ithaca, New York




identified and their corresponding trip generation figures have been added to the study
area roadways. Additionally, based upon historical traffic volumes in the CBD area, a 1%
per year growth rate has been applied to existing traffic volumes at the study area
intersections for the two-year build-out period. Future background traffic volumes are
shown in Figure 4.


VI. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

A. Description
   The proposed State Street Triangle development is a mixed-use residential, retail,
   and restaurant project located in the heart of downtown Ithaca. Its location is at the
   eastern gateway to Ithaca Commons. The proposed development provides
   approximately 240 apartment units, a 2,797 square foot (SF) restaurant, 9,045 SF of
   retail space divided between five separate spaces, a 1,005 SF fitness area, 2,988 SF of
   an amenity space, and 1,987 SF of leasing space. A retail trash/loading area (5,194 SF)
   is proposed in the central courtyard. Parking for the building’s residents and patrons
   will be provided in the Cayuga Street Parking Garage. The parking agreement will
   provide up to 250 parking spaces for the proposed development. As well, there will
   be two to three carshare vehicles available for use by the proposed project’s users.
   An access point will be provided along Aurora Street to be used for loading and
   unloading of service vehicles during off-peak hours. Figure 5 illustrates the
   proposed concept site plan.

B. Site Traffic and Parking Generation
     Traffic Generation
     The volume of traffic generated by a site is dependent on the intended land use and
     size of the development. Trip generation is an estimate of the number of trips
     generated by a specific building or land use. These trips represent the volume of
     traffic entering and exiting the development. The Institute of Transportation
     Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition manual is used as a reference for this
     information. The trip rate for the peak hour of the generator may or may not
     coincide in time or volume with the trip rate for the peak hour of adjacent street
     traffic. Volumes generated during the peak hour of adjacent street traffic, in this
     case, the weekday AM and PM peaks, represent a more critical volume when
     analyzing the capacity of the system; those intervals will provide the basis of this
     analysis.

     Table I shows the site generated trips for the residential component during the
     weekday AM and weekday PM peak hours for the proposed site. Also included in
     Table 1 are trip reduction calculations. An analysis was undertaken of the most
     recent 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates produced by the
     United States Census Bureau. The most recent data shows that over 42 percent of
     the population walks to work within the City. Within the City, 10.1 percent of
     people use public transportation, 8.9 percent carpool, and 2.2 percent bike to work.
     Finally, 7.5 percent of the City’s population is reported to telecommute. It is

                                               4                             August 2015
Traffic Impact Study                   Proposed State Street Triangle        City of Ithaca, New York




     expected that the residential demographic will be serviced by TCAT, as well as
     having the ability to travel to their destination via walking and bicycling. Therefore, a
     conservative 10 percent reduction in trip generation has been applied to the trip
     generation calculations to account for transit usage based on the existing transit
     mode share within the City. Furthermore, this study assumes a 15 percent reduction
     in vehicle trips as it relates to pedestrian and bicycle travel modes using the site.
     Residents will also be able to access carshare via the Cayuga Street parking garage.

     The trip generation estimates and trip reduction credits used in this report have
     been updated from the State Street Triangle Traffic Assessment previously
     submitted on June 11, 2015, and are more representative of the uses proposed for
     the State Street Triangle site, based upon comments from the City of Ithaca.

     All trip generation calculations are included in the Appendix of this report.

     Parking Generation
     Urban Land Institute (ULI) Methodology for shared parking, a national standard, was
     used to estimate the number of parking spaces required for the proposed project in
     conjunction with the reductions applicable for a mixed-use site with access to quality
     transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities. This methodology is utilized by traffic
     engineers and planners when evaluating the parking demand for a mixed-use project.

     Shared parking synergies exist when (a) there are different uses that have peak
     operating times at different times of the day, and (b) when there are related or
     complementary uses where patrons of one use also access the complementary use.
     The ULI study also identifies monthly variations in parking demand by use for each
     month of the year.

     Mixed-use projects such as the one proposed, will experience parking synergy as
     described in the preceding paragraph. The parking efficiencies that will result reduce
     the excess supply of parking and associated loss of green space, storm drainage

     impacts and maintenance expenses. Additionally, it’s important that sufficient parking
     is provided to prevent intrusion of parking into neighborhoods or adjoining
     properties, excessive vehicle circulation, and dissatisfied tenants and customers.

     Land use data proposed for the proposed project was entered in the Shared Parking
     Model; a spreadsheet that estimates the shared parking demand in mixed-use
     projects. The spreadsheet produces the base parking requirements before shared
     use factors are in place. Based on this base data, there is a requirement for
     approximately 385 parking spaces. The Model was calibrated to take into account
     mode adjustments, that is, those users who are arrive to the site via means of
     transportation other than a personal automobile. Based on the trip reduction credits
     used to determine the projected trip generation, an 80 percent mode adjustment
     has been used (i.e. 20 percent of the total site generated trips will arrive to the site
     using transit, walking, or bicycling instead of passenger vehicles). Additionally, the
     non-captive ratio has been calibrated to better reflect the percentage of parkers at
     the site who are not already counted as being parked. For example, when residents
     of one land use visit a nearby coffee store, there usually is not any additional parking
     demand generated. As such, the non-captive ratio is 95 percent, as it is projected
     that five percent of the proposed site’s users will already be on-site while
     patronizing another land use. Using the calibrated model, a Shared Parking
     Reduction factor of 40 percent has been calculated; this equates to a total of 283
     parking spaces needed.

     A total of 57 parking spaces are required for customers, seven parking spaces for
     employees (commercial), and 219 parking spaces are reserved for residents. The
     parking capacity for the proposed project will be provided primarily in the Cayuga
     Street Parking Garage via 250 reserved parking spaces. It should be noted that 27
     bicycle parking spaces are provided on-site which may reduce the need for vehicle
     parking spaces. Additionally, there were will be two to three carshare parking spaces
     which can equate to a reduction of approximately 15 personal automobiles per
     carshare vehicle, as per information gathered from Ithaca Carshare.

     The deficit in parking spaces may need to be provided through the use of the City’s
     other public parking garages (e.g., Tioga Street and Green Street) or available on-
     street parking. It should be noted that other parking adjustment factors may be
     considered to reduce the total demand for parking. The Victoria Transport Policy
     Institute’s Parking Management: Strategies, Evaluation and Planning (2013) indicates
     factors such as carsharing, demographics, nearby land use mix, employment density,
     transit accessibility, et al have the ability to affect parking demand and optimal
     parking supply.

C. Site Traffic Distribution
     The cumulative effect of site traffic on the transportation network is dependent on
     the origins and destinations of that traffic and the location of the access drives
     serving the site.

Traffic Impact Study              Proposed State Street Triangle         City of Ithaca, New York




     The proposed arrival/departure distribution of traffic to be generated at this site is
     considered a function of several parameters, including the following:
               Colleges and Universities in the area;
               Employment centers;
               Retail centers;
               Existing highway network (considering the one-way street system);
               Existing traffic conditions and controls;
               Cayuga Street Parking Garage access drive location;

     Figure 6 shows the anticipated trip distribution pattern percentages for the
     proposed development and Figure 7 illustrates the peak hour site generated traffic
     based on those percentages for the weekday AM and PM peak hour periods.


VII. FULL DEVELOPMENT VOLUMES
Proposed design hour traffic volumes are developed for each peak by combining the
background traffic conditions (Figure 4) and the newly created traffic generations (Figure
7). The resulting network design hour volumes, based on the development as proposed,
are illustrated in Figure 8.


VIII. CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Capacity analysis is a technique used for determining a measure of effectiveness for a
section of roadway and/or intersection based on the number of vehicles during a specific
time period. The measure of effectiveness used for the capacity analysis is referred to as
a Level of Service (LOS). Levels of Service are calculated to provide an indication of the
amount of delay that a motorist experiences while traveling along a roadway or through
an intersection. Since the most amount of delay to motorists usually occurs at
intersections, the capacity analysis specifically focuses on intersections.

Six Levels of Service are defined for analysis purposes. They are assigned letter
designations, from "A" to "F", with LOS "A" representing the best conditions and LOS
"F" the worst. Suggested ranges of service capacity and an explanation of Levels of
Service are included in the Appendix.

The standard procedure for capacity analysis of signalized and un-signalized intersections
is outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) published by the
Transportation Research Board. Traffic analysis software, Synchro 8, which is based on
procedures and methodologies contained in the HCM, was used to analyze operating
conditions at study area intersections. The procedure yields a Level of Service (LOS)
based on the HCM 2010 as an indicator of how well intersections operate.

Existing operating conditions during the peak study periods are evaluated to determine
a basis for comparison with the projected future conditions. The future traffic

   conditions generated by the development were analyzed to assess the operations of the
   intersections in the study area. Capacity results for existing, background, and full
   development are listed in Table III. The discussion following the table summarizes
   capacity conditions. All capacity analysis calculations are included in the Appendix.

2 = Full development conditions represent mitigated conditions using minor signal timing adjustments. No

M.L.K. Jr. Street/Green Street
The results show that this intersection operates at overall level of service “B” and “A”
during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively, under all conditions. No change in level
of service is expected as a result of the proposed development. As such, no mitigation is
warranted or recommended at this intersection.

M.L.K. Jr. Street/Seneca Way West
The overall LOS changes from “C” to “D” during the PM peak hour between
background and full development conditions. However, the actual increase in delay is
less than 1.0 second per vehicle. The remaining approaches operate at LOS “D” or
better during both peak hours under all conditions with minor increases in delay. As
such, no mitigation is recommended at this intersection as a result of this development.

M.L.K. Jr. Street/Aurora Street
The overall level of service operates at “C” during the AM peak hour and “D” during
the PM peak hour under all conditions. Increasing the green time given to westbound
motorists between background and full development conditions during the PM peak
hour improves the westbound LOS from “E” to “D”. Although the northbound
operating condition changes from LOS “B” to “C”, between background and full
development conditions, the overall delay during the PM peak hour improves from 58.9
seconds to 37.1 seconds.

The intersection of M.L.K Jr. Street and Aurora Street should be reconstructed in order
to remove the northbound right-turn channelized island. The removal of the channelized
right-turn lane creates a larger space on the southeastern corner of the intersection for
pedestrians and reduces the total footprint of the intersection. In addition, the total
crossing distance for pedestrians traversing the northbound approach is reduced,
making for a more pedestrian-oriented intersection. As a result of this recommendation,
no changes in LOS or delay are projected during the peak hours.

East Seneca Street/North Aurora Street
The westbound thru approach is expected to change in level of service from “C” to “D”
during the PM peak hour between background and full development conditions. This
change in LOS is a result of a borderline condition between LOS “C” and LOS “D” and
the actual increase in delay is 5 seconds per vehicle. All other approaches operate at
LOS “C” or better during both peak hours under all conditions. No mitigation is
warranted or recommended.

East Seneca Street/Tioga Street
The overall levels of service for this intersection are “A” and “B” during the AM and PM
peak hours, respectively, under all conditions. No changes in LOS are projected for the
approaches or the overall intersection as a result of the proposed development. As
such, no mitigation is warranted or recommended.

East Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street
The overall intersection level of service is “C” during the AM and PM peak hours under
all conditions. The exception is the overall LOS during the PM peak hour under full
development conditions. Signal timing adjustments to increase the green time given to
southbound motorists during the AM and PM peak hours improves the LOS from “E”
under the background condition to “D” under the full development condition during the
AM peak hour and reduces the delays during the PM peak hour. No further mitigation is
recommended at this intersection.

Green Street/South Cayuga Street
The overall level of service at this intersection is “C” during the AM and PM peak hours
under all conditions. All approaches operate at LOS “D” or better during both peak
hours under all conditions. Signal timing adjustments to increase the green time given to
southbound and northbound motorists during the AM peak hour reduces the delay for
northbound right-turning motorists as a result of the proposed development. No
further mitigation is recommended at this intersection.


IX. TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT PLAN

Transportation Demand Management (TDM) or Commute Trip Reduction (CTR)
initiatives, if implemented strategically, can have a noticeable impact on reducing trips
from a project. TDM is the application of strategies and policies to reduce Single
Occupant Vehicle (SOV) travel demand, or to redistribute this demand in space or in
time. By definition, TDM includes various strategies that produce a more efficient use of
transportation resources and increase the efficiency of a transportation system.

TDM programs have many potential benefits. They can reduce the total number of
vehicle miles traveled by promoting alternatives to driving alone. Fewer vehicle miles
traveled results in less ozone pollution. Employers can use TDM programs to reduce
overhead costs, enhance productivity and reduce employee turnover. TDM programs
can also improve the use of public transit services, bikeways, sidewalks and carpool
lanes by educating users about their travel options and coordinating trips between users
with similar trip patterns. Implementing an effective TDM program may reduce the
required number of parking spaces for a project and/or eliminate the need to consider
building costly multi-story parking structures. Table III, on the following page,
summarizes some of the benefits that can be realized from an effective TDM program.

    Physical Fitness and Health
                                   activity, usually through increased daily walking and cycling.


The following TDM strategies are recommended for consideration and implementation
in connection with the proposed State Street Triangle:

Transit Coordination – Continued coordination with TCAT on transit ridership and
marketing the nearby routes will boost ridership through increased awareness coupled
with improved service.

Bus Stop Amenities – A clean, well-lit, informative bus stop with shelters and seating
greatly improves the image of the transit serving an area. Station amenities make taking
the bus a comfortable experience, while proper maintenance tells people that transit
makes up an important part of the neighborhood. Bus stop shelters should have the
following elements:
     A level concrete pad, unobstructed by street furniture, landscaping, or signage
     Reliable pedestrian access with clear sidewalks providing direct access to the bus
        loading area
     Clear sight lines allowing travelers to see around the stop and drivers to see
        around corners to make turns
     Adequate lighting
     Pedestrian amenities such as a bench and trash receptacle
     Route, schedule and information
     Bicycle rack

Carpooling – Carpooling will be encouraged by providing incentives and other services
such as ride-matching.

                                                 11                                  August 2015
Traffic Impact Study             Proposed State Street Triangle           City of Ithaca, New York




Transportation Alternatives Information – Bus schedules, walking and bicycling
maps, neighborhood and on-site wayfinding will be made readily available.

Location and Quantity of Bicycle Parking Spaces – The proposed project will
include convenient bicycle parking locations in clear sight of access points into the
building, safe and secure longer-term storage within parking areas, and sufficient number
of bicycle parking spaces that encourage a greater number and demographic of
residents, employees, and visitors to utilize bicycling as a means of transportation.

Carshare – The project site will have two to three carshare parking spaces to
encourage lower rates of personal automobile ownership and reduce parking demand.

Coordination with the nearby Colleges/Universities – A successful relationship
between the proposed project and the nearby education institutions of Ithaca College
and Cornell University can affect the trip generation rates and parking demand for the
proposed project. Transportation services like a dedicated shuttle may encourage lower
rates of SOV usage.I-MODAL CONSIDERATIONS

The proposed State Street Triangle development will take advantage of the City’s
existing multi-modal transportation system, as well as augment it through an improved
interface with the public realm. Developing a mixed-use project of this nature will help
meet the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, enhance the pedestrian and bicycle
experience, and further activate an historic part of downtown Ithaca.


X. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the projected site generated traffic volumes and projected levels of service,
the proposed State Street Triangle development in the City of Ithaca will not have a
significant adverse impact on existing traffic operations in the area, as documented in
this report. The analyses contained in this report indicate that the existing
transportation network can adequately accommodate the projected traffic volumes and
resulting impacts to study area intersections with the recommendations outlined. The
following conclusions and recommendations are based upon the results of the analyses:

1. The proposed development is expected to generate approximately 34 entering/73
   exiting vehicles during the AM peak hour and 89 entering/56 exiting vehicles during
   the PM peak hour.

2. Minor signal timing changes are needed at three study intersections:
    Aurora Street/M.L.K. Jr. Street
    East Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street
    Green Street/South Cayuga Street

3. The intersection of M.L.K Jr. Street and Aurora Street should be reconstructed in
   order to remove the northbound right-turn channelized island. The removal of the
   channelized right-turn lane creates a larger space on the southeastern corner of the

     intersection for pedestrians and reduces the total footprint of the intersection. In
     addition, the total crossing distance for pedestrians traversing the northbound
     approach is reduced, making for a more pedestrian-oriented intersection.

4. With the recommended signal timing mitigation in place, the proposed project will
   not result in any potentially significant adverse traffic impacts to the study area
   intersections.

5. Pedestrian walkways and connections to existing sidewalks are included.

6. Bicycle racks are provided on-site.

7. Using the Shared Parking Model, a total of 283 parking spaces are needed. A total of
   57 parking spaces are required for customers, seven parking spaces for employees
   (commercial), and 219 parking spaces are reserved for residents.

8. The parking capacity for the proposed project will be provided primarily in the
   Cayuga Street Parking Garage via 250 reserved parking spaces. The 27 bicycle
   parking spaces provided on-site may reduce the need for vehicle parking spaces.
   Additionally, there were will be two to three carshare parking spaces which can
   equate to a reduction of approximately 15 personal automobiles per carshare
   vehicle.

9. The deficit in parking spaces may need to be provided through the use of the City’s
   other public parking garages (e.g., Tioga Street and Green Street) or available on-
   street parking. It should be noted that other parking adjustment factors may be
   considered to reduce the total demand for parking. Factors such as carsharing,
   demographics, nearby land use mix, employment density, transit accessibility, et al
   have the ability to affect parking demand and optimal parking supply.

10. Truck deliveries are planned on-site during off-peak hours.

    Level of Service:
Criteria and Definitions
            Level of Service Criteria
              Highway Capacity Manual 2010
SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Level of Service is a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic
stream, based on service measures such as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic
interruptions, comfort, and convenience. Level of Service for signalized intersections is defined
in terms of delay specifically, average total delay per vehicle for a 15 minute analysis period. The
ranges are as follows:


                                     Level     Control Delay
                                      of        per vehicle
                                    Service      (seconds)
                                      A             < 10
                                       B          10 – 20
                                      C           20 – 35
                                      D           35 – 55
                                       E          55 – 80
                                       F            >80


UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Level of Service for unsignalized intersections is also defined in terms of delay. However, the
delay criteria are different from a signalized intersection. The primary reason for this is driver
expectation that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. The total delay threshold for any given Level of Service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. The ranges are as follows:


                                     Level     Control Delay
                                      of        per vehicle
                                    Service      (seconds)
                                      A             < 10
                                       B          10 – 15
                                      C           15 – 25
                                      D           25 – 35
                                       E          35 - 50
                                       F            >50

                                            Site Logistics
The site logistics plan for the construction and pedestrian traffic on the State Street project, which will
be executed with the safety of the surrounding community as our primary goal. We plan to achieve this
through a number of methods that will be implemented from the start of the construction phase,
including:

    •   Utilizing the proposed grading cut along the East Green Street as our primary means of servicing
        the project site. Having this loading / unloading zone will allow us to get construction traffic off
        of the primary roadway so that we can safely service the construction site without having to
        impede the public traffic with a lane closure along this route. This also allows for easier access
        to and from the construction site along Rt. 79 reducing the traffic flow in and around the
        Commons.




    •   The parking lane along State Street will need to be utilized for the construction project;
        elimination of these meters will lessen the impact of having motorists parking along the
        construction site without a sidewalk immediately adjacent to the parking meter. Compensation
        for the meter revenue will be paid for through the project while meters are out of service.
    •   Concrete traffic barriers and construction fencing will be utilized around the entire perimeter of
        the site to protect from vehicle traffic and promote site security.
    •   Construction signs will be placed along South Aurora Street alerting motorists of changing traffic
        patterns due to the turning lane closure between South Aurora and State Street. A new
        pedestrian crosswalk will be installed to allow pedestrian traffic to the utilize the existing
        stairwell between South Aurora and East Green Street
    •   Construction Signs will be placed along all surrounding roadways alerting motorists of flagmen
        and construction traffic entering the roadway
    •   Flagmen will be employed to facilitate safe entry of construction vehicles to and from the jobsite
        onto the main roadways
    •   Stabilized construction entrances will be utilized to minimize the impact of construction
        activities on the surrounding streets and community.
State	  Street	  Triangle	  Project	  –	  Transportation	  &	  Parking	  Summary	                            	  

The	  State	  Street	  Triangle	  Project	  is	  a	  Pedestrian	  Oriented	  Development	  following	  smart	  growth	  urban	  
design	  standards.	  	  Consistent	  with	  the	  new	  2013	  zoning	  by	  the	  City	  of	  Ithaca,	  the	  building	  will	  encourage	  
the	  use	  of	  public	  transit	  and	  alternative	  modes	  of	  transportation.	  	  Only	  a	  limited	  number	  of	  on-­‐site	  
parking	  spaces	  will	  be	  available	  including	  handicap	  access.	  	  	  

Residents	  of	  the	  project	  will	  be	  encouraged	  that	  a	  private	  vehicle	  is	  not	  necessary	  to	  live	  in	  Ithaca.	  	  For	  
those	  residents	  that	  choose	  to	  have	  a	  private	  vehicle,	  several	  options	  exist	  for	  long	  term	  and	  overnight	  
parking,	  including	  City	  of	  Ithaca	  owned	  and	  managed	  garages	  as	  well	  as	  other	  private	  options.	  	  

The	  project	  team	  will	  work	  with	  the	  City,	  County,	  TCAT,	  universities,	  and	  the	  Downtown	  Ithaca	  Alliance	  
on	  Transportation	  Demand	  Management,	  including	  the	  potential	  for	  park	  and	  ride	  and	  rapid	  transit,	  
consistent	  with	  each	  organizations	  comprehensive	  plan.	  	  

The	  site	  has	  a	  WalkScore.com	  rating	  of	  96,	  meaning	  that	  a	  car	  is	  not	  necessary	  to	  perform	  daily	  errands	  
(Ithaca’s	  average	  score	  is	  65).	  Provisions	  will	  also	  be	  made	  at	  the	  site	  for	  tenant	  service	  pick-­‐ups	  and	  
deliveries	  including	  dry	  cleaning	  and	  groceries.	  This	  is	  consistent	  with	  national	  trends	  toward	  urban	  car-­‐
free	  living,	  with	  Ithaca’s	  Mayor	  Myrick	  even	  forgoing	  a	  personal	  vehicle.	  	  

Public	  Transit	  Options	  	  	  

It	  is	  anticipated	  that	  the	  project	  will	  be	  attractive	  to	  Ithacans	  seeking	  a	  downtown	  living	  experience,	  as	  
well	  as	  Cornell	  and	  Ithaca	  College	  students.	  For	  those	  not	  living	  and	  working	  downtown,	  the	  site	  
provides	  excellent	  access	  to	  TCAT.	  	  For	  students	  in	  particular,	  the	  #10	  and	  #11	  TCAT	  Bus	  routes	  provide	  
quick,	  efficient	  direct	  routes	  to	  campus	  within	  a	  2	  minute	  walk	  from	  the	  site.	  	  According	  to	  TCAT	  staff,	  
the	  site	  is	  the	  best	  location	  in	  downtown	  for	  access	  to	  public	  transit.	  	  

Bike	  Share	  

The	  developer,	  Campus	  Advantage,	  is	  exploring	  options	  to	  provide	  a	  bike	  share	  program	  at	  the	  property	  
for	  residents.	  	  Additionally,	  a	  public	  bike	  share	  program	  is	  being	  contemplated	  as	  part	  of	  the	  sidewalk	  
expansion	  that	  is	  envisioned	  along	  State	  Street.	  

Car	  Share	  

Campus	  Advantage	  is	  hoping	  to	  team	  up	  with	  Ithaca	  Carshare	  for	  a	  location	  at	  the	  project.	  	  Ithaca	  
Carshare	  is	  an	  increasingly	  popular	  alternative	  to	  owning	  a	  private	  vehicle.	  	  According	  to	  the	  Ithaca	  
Carshare	  website,	  for	  each	  Ithaca	  Carshare	  car	  in	  the	  fleet,	  15.4	  fewer	  personal	  cars	  are	  owned!	  
Carsharing	  shifts	  habits	  to	  reduce	  car	  use,	  a	  major	  source	  of	  greenhouse	  gas	  emissions.	  It	  also	  saves	  the	  
tenant	  over	  $8,600,	  the	  average	  cost	  to	  own	  and	  operate	  a	  vehicle	  (AAA,	  2015).	  	  

Parking	  

A	  four-­‐point	  parking	  program	  is	  being	  created	  for	  residents	  with	  private	  vehicles.	  	  The	  plan	  is	  being	  
created	  in	  conjunction	  with	  the	  City	  of	  Ithaca’s	  parking	  facilities	  and	  will	  utilize	  vacant	  parking	  spaces	  in	  
existing	  City	  garages	  and	  surface	  lots.	  	  It	  is	  conservatively	  anticipated	  that	  up	  to	  40%	  of	  the	  residents	  
may	  have	  personal	  vehicles	  which	  equates	  to	  approximately	  250	  spaces.	  	  	  
       •   Cayuga	  Garage	  -­‐	  Campus	  Advantage	  is	  in	  the	  process	  of	  seeking	  a	  parking	  agreement	  with	  the	  
           non-­‐profit	  ownership	  entity	  for	  Cayuga	  Garage	  to	  utilize	  vacant	  spaces	  in	  the	  upper	  levels	  of	  the	  
           garage.	  	  There	  are	  over	  300	  vacant	  parking	  spaces	  in	  the	  garage	  and	  parking	  revenues	  from	  
           residents	  of	  the	  project	  will	  help	  reduce	  the	  $960,000	  in	  annual	  public	  subsidies	  currently	  
           needed	  to	  fund	  the	  garage	  debt.	  	  	  
       •   Seneca	  Garage	  –	  Approximately	  100	  vacant	  spaces	  have	  been	  identified	  by	  City	  parking	  officials	  
           that	  could	  be	  reserved	  by	  residents	  of	  the	  State	  Street	  Triangle	  Project.	  	  	  
       •   Green	  Street	  Garage	  –	  There	  are	  approximately	  75	  underutilized	  spaces	  in	  the	  Green	  Street	  
           Garage	  which	  is	  within	  a	  2-­‐3	  minute	  walk	  from	  the	  site.	  	  	  
       •   Satellite	  Lots	  –	  Surface	  parking	  lots	  near	  the	  Cornell	  campus	  and	  others	  that	  are	  in	  the	  planning	  
           stage	  elsewhere	  throughout	  the	  City	  will	  be	  available	  for	  those	  residents	  that	  primarily	  use	  their	  
           vehicles	  on	  weekends	  and	  holidays.	  	  The	  lots	  can	  be	  easily	  accessed	  via	  public	  transit.

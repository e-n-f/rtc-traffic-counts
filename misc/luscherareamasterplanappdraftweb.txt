2012 PARKS AND
RECREATION SYSTEM
PLAN
The Parks Plan 2025: Lake Oswego Parks,
Recreation and Natural Areas System Plan was
adopted by the City in 2012 after a nearly two-
year planning process. The Parks Plan 2025
was written concurrently with the City’s
Comprehensive Plan update, which will be
completed in 2013, providing strong
continuity between the two plans.
The Parks Plan 2025 vision statement
emphasizes a sustainable and interconnected
system of parks, recreation facilities, programs,
historic sites and natural areas that play a
critical role in making Lake Oswego a livable
community. Four basic goals ground the plan:
investing in existing parks and natural areas;
enhancing stewardship, maintenance and
operations; providing recreation options; and
filling geographic gaps. Funding strategies
emphasize key partnerships with the school
district, private partnerships, and partnerships
with non-profit and other governmental
agencies.

SITE HISTORY
Documentation from Lake Oswego’s
formative eras provides information
regarding the historic, natural and
topographic features of the area
known today as the Luscher Area.
Notes from an 1852 survey map
describe the present-day Luscher
property as having “rolly and hilly
lands, good second rate clay loam
soil, scattered woodlands, with an
understory of hazel, willows and
ferns.” A road from Tualatin Plains
to Oregon City ran through the

SITE CONTEXT
During the Luscher Area Master Plan process,
it was important to develop an understanding
of the property in relationship to the City of
Lake Oswego and METRO’s urban growth

relationship by showing that a majority of the

Lake Oswego limits, in unincorporated

The Rassekh property is the exception, as it is
located outside the UGB but within the city
limits. See Figure 2.5: City Limits Map. A
majority of the Luscher Area is also located
outside the urban growth boundary. The one
exception is the Hazelia Field site which is
located within the city limits and the UGB.
See Figure 2.6: Urban Growth Boundary Map.


CURRENT ZONING
The Luscher properties are subject to three
zoning designations. Most of the acreage is
zoned Exclusive Farm Use (EFU, Clackamas
County zoning). The remainder of the

(PNA, City of Lake Oswego zoning) and Rural

Clackamas County zoning). There is also a
Clackamas County Historic Landmark Overlay
on the 22.15 acres of the Luscher farm site. At
the time of this report, all of the Luscher Area
properties are owned by the City of Lake
Oswego. With the exception of the Hazelia
Field site, the Luscher Area is located outside
of the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and
falls under the jurisdiction of Clackamas
County. See Figure 2.7: Zoning (page 13).

It is important to note that the City’s historic

modifications and impacts to historic
resources.

be done in coordination with urban

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In  the  areas  immediately  surrounding  the  existing  LINK  light  rail  stations  in  North  Beacon  Hill, 
Othello,  and  Mount  Baker  /  North  Rainier,  there  is  a  proposal  to  increase  building  heights  and 
density  to  accommodate  additional  residential  and  employment  growth.    This  additional 
development  is  consistent  with  the  Neighborhood  Plans  in  each  of  these  areas,  which  call  for 
the  development  of  vibrant  mixed  use  centers  around  the  transit  stations.   The  analysis  in  this 
report  evaluates  potential  transportation  impacts  under  existing  conditions,  2030  No  Action, 
and 2030 With Action (additional building heights and density) conditions.   

Existing conditions were analyzed based on counts from November, 2010.  The 2030 background 
growth  and  trip  generation  were  derived  from  the  City  of  Seattle's  travel  demand  forecasting 
model.   2030  trip  generation  in  each  study  area  was  calculated  using  Fehr  &  Peers'  proprietary 
Mixed Use Development (MXD) trip generation tool. 

The  Seattle  travel  model  predicts  background  traffic  growth  of  2040  percent  on  study  area 
corridors by 2030.  These increases in volume lead to higher levels of intersection delay resulting 
from  expected  growth,  and  provide  a  future  base  condition.    This  future  base  projection 
provides  the  basis  of  comparison  for  additional  delay  resulting  from  the  proposed  increase  to 
station  area  building  heights  and  density.    The  results  of  this  analysis  showed  no  significant 
traffic related impacts as a result of the proposed increase in building heights and density under 
2030  conditions.   However,  in  the  Mount  Baker  area,  portions  of  Hanford  Street  and  MLK  Way 
are  currently  lacking  sidewalks.    Due  to  the  increase  in  future  pedestrian  volumes,  this  is 
deemed  to  be  a  potentially  significant  impact  with  the  recommended  mitigation  of  completing 
the sidewalk network.  The increased project density is expected to add between 2153 PM peak 
hour  transit  trips  in  each  neighborhood.    Based  on  information  from  King  County  Metro  and 
Sound  Transit,  each  area  currently  has  adequate  overall  transit  capacity  (however  King  County 
Metro  Route  7  can  experience  crowding  during  peak  times).   Given  the  robust  transit  system  in 
the  study  areas  and  the  relatively  small  increase  in  transit  trips  as  a  result  of  the  height  and 
density increases, no transit related impacts are anticipated.     

This  project  also  reviewed  specific  design  element  changes  in  each  neighborhood.    In  Mount 
Baker  there  is  a  proposal  to  add  a  landscaped  median  and  bike  lanes  on  Beacon  Avenue.   This  is 
discussed  in  Appendix  A.    Adequate  rightofway  and  capacity  exists  to  accommodate  these 
design changes under current and future conditions.  Appendix B analyzes a proposal to provide 
offpeak  parking  in  the  outer  lane  of  MLK  Way  in  the  Othello  neighborhood.    Based  on  existing 
traffic  volumes,  the  results  indicate  that  parking  can  be  allowed  at  all  times  except  3:00  PM  ­ 
7:00  PM  in  the  northbound  and  southbound  directions,  and  7:00  AM  ­  9:00  AM  in  the 
northbound  direction.   In  the  Mount  Baker  area  there  is  a  proposal  to  convert  portions  of  MLK 
Way  and  Rainier  Avenue  into  a  oneway  couplet  near  the  Mount  Baker  Transit  Station.    The 
analysis  of  this  proposal  in  2030  conditions,  provided  in  Appendix  C,  shows  potential  impacts  at 
the  intersection  level,  but  an  overall  improvement  in  corridor  travel  times  during  the  PM  peak 




                                                                                                               1

hour.    The  oneway  couplet  configuration  would  also  allow  for  a  dedicated  transit  lane  on 
Rainier Avenue, increased pedestrian space, and a short twoway cycletrack on MLK Way.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
This  report  discusses  traffic  analysis  results  for  the  North  Beacon  Hill  Neighborhood  Planning 
Area,  North  Rainier  /  Mount  Baker  Station  Area,  and  Othello  Station  Areas.   Each  neighborhood 
is  currently  served  by  LINK  light  rail  operated  by  Sound  Transit,  which  provides  service  between 
downtown  Seattle  and  the  SeattleTacoma  International  Airport.    Additionally,  all  the 
neighborhoods are served by multiple King County Metro bus lines.   

The  focus  of  this  document  is  to  identify  if  there  are  any  potentially  significant  negative 
transportation  impacts  related  to  proposed  increases  to  building  heights  and  densities  in  the 
neighborhoods.    The  additional  land  use  intensity  is  proposed  to  help  revitalize  some 
underdeveloped properties and take advantage of the high quality transit services in each of the 
study areas. 

In each of the three study areas, Fehr & Peers analyzed three different scenarios: 

         Existing conditions, based on traffic counts taken in November 2010 

         2030  Base  conditions,  representing  future  traffic  and  land  use  conditions  under 
         expected  growth  levels  (without  any  changes  to  heights  or  densities  ­  No  Action 
         alternative) 

         2030  Project  conditions,  representing  future  traffic  and  land  use  conditions  with 
         increased  employment  and  population  resulting  from  increased  building  heights  and 
         densities (the With Action alternative) in the project areas 

Both 2030 scenarios were modeled using the City of Seattle travel demand forecasting model to 
determine  background  traffic  growth  and  project  area  trip  distributions.    The  Seattle  travel 
model's  trip  generation  component  was  not  used  for  this  analysis  because  Fehr  &  Peers' 
evaluation of the model's performance indicates that the Seattle travel model is not sensitive to 
the  vehicle  trip  generation  reductions  that  are  typical  of  increased  height  and  density  in  transit 
station  areas.    To  more  accurately  estimate  the  trip  generation  of  the  station  areas,  Fehr  & 
Peers  used  their  proprietary  Mixed  Use  Development  (MXD)  trip  generation  tool.  This  tool, 
which  has  been  endorsed  by  groups  such  as  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  and  the  San 
Diego  Area  Council  of  Governments,  and  has  been  used  for  other  environmental  analyses  in 
Seattle, considers factors such as urban form (density and diversity of land uses), demographics, 
level  of  transit  service,  and  design  of  the  bicycle  and  pedestrian  system  in  the  neighborhoods.  
The  MXD  tool  was  used  in  conjunction  with  the  Seattle  travel  model  to  estimate  future  traffic 
flows and level of service (LOS) at key study intersections in each of the study areas.  In addition 
to  intersection  analysis,  transportation  system  design  alternatives  to  improve  the  pedestrian, 
bicycle,  and  transit  environments  were  evaluated  in  each  of  the  three  study  areas.   The  results 
of the transportation system design evaluation are presented in Appendices AC.

CHAPTER 2. ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
This  section  describes  the  transportation  impact  analysis  techniques  that  were  used  in  each  of 
the  three  study  areas.  Based  on  other  environmental  documents  prepared  in  the  area, 
transportation  impacts  were  assessed  by  evaluating  LOS  at  key  study  intersections.    These 
results  were  compared  to  intersection  LOS  thresholds  defined  by  the  Seattle  Department  of 
Planning and Development (DPD).   

IMPACT THRESHOLD

 A  significant  transportation  impact  was  identified  if  the  additional  traffic  associated  with  the 
increased  heights  and  densities  would  cause  an  intersection  to  degrade  from  an  acceptable  LOS 
D  or  better  to  an  unacceptable  LOS  E  or  F.   This  LOS  D  threshold  has  been  identified  by  DPD  for 
impact analyses throughout the City. 

LOS ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

LOS  results  were  calculated  for  existing,  future  No  Action,  and  future  With  Action  conditions  for 
intersections  in  each  area  utilizing  Highway  Capacity  Manual  (HCM)  (Transportation  Research 
Board, 2000) methodologies.   

For  roadway  segments  with  signalized  traffic  control,  roadway  operations  are  typically  defined 
by  how  well  intersections  along  the  roadway  function,  since  intersections  represent  the  points 
with  the  least  capacity.  The  HCM  describes  intersection  operations  using  the  level  of  service 
(LOS)  concept.    LOS  is  a  qualitative  description  of  traffic  flow  based  on  such  factors  as  speed, 
travel  time,  delay,  and  freedom  to  maneuver.  Six  levels  are  defined  from  LOS  A,  with  the  least 
congested  operating  conditions,  to  LOS  F,  with  the  most  congested  operating  conditions.  LOS  E 
represents  "atcapacity"  operations.  Operations  are  designated  as  LOS  F  when  volumes  exceed 
capacity, resulting in stopandgo conditions and long delays at intersections. 

The  LOS  method  for  signalized  intersections  analyzes  operations  based  on  average  control 
vehicular  delay,  as  described  in  Chapter  16  of  the  HCM.  Control  delay  includes  initial 
deceleration  delay,  queue  moveup  time,  stopped  delay,  and  final  acceleration  delay.  The 
average  control  delay  for  signalized  intersections  was  calculated  using  the  Synchro  analysis 
software. Control delay is related to LOS based on the thresholds shown in Table 1. 

Operations  of  unsignalized  intersections  are  evaluated  using  the  method  contained  in  Chapter 
17 of the HCM. At twoway or sidestreet stopcontrolled intersections, control delay is reported 
for  the  minor  movement  with  the  highest  control  delay,  not  for  the  intersection  as  a  whole.  For 
allway  stopcontrolled  intersections,  the  LOS  is  based  on  the  weighted  average  control  delay  of 
all  movements.  The  relationships  between  control  delay  and  LOS  for  unsignalized  intersections 
are also presented in Table 1. 




                                                                                                                5

EXISTING CONDITIONS INTERSECTION LOS ANALYSIS

Existing  conditions  intersection  LOS  analysis  was  based  on  PM  peak  period  traffic  counts 
conducted  on  Wednesday,  November  10,  2010.  The  intersection  counts  included  data  on  light 
vehicles,  heavy  vehicles  (including  buses),  pedestrians,  and  bicycles.   Detailed  count  sheets  are 
provided  in  Appendix  D.   The  detailed  LOS  analysis  calculation  sheets  for  existing  conditions  are 
provided  in  Appendix  E.  Analysis  results  are  described  for  each  study  area  in  the  following 
chapters. 

FUTURE (2030) CONDITIONS INTERSECTION ANALYSIS

2030  traffic  volumes  were  developed  for  each  study  area  under  No  Action  and  With  Action 
conditions.   As  described  in  Chapter  1,  future  traffic  forecasts  were  developed  using  the  Seattle 
travel  demand  forecasting  model  and  Fehr  and  Peers'  MXD  tool.   PM  peak  period  intersection 
LOS  was  calculated  and  potential  impacts  related  to  the  height  and  density  changes  were 
determined  using  the  impact  thresholds  described  above.   With  the  exception  of  roadway  and 
intersection  design  changes  in  Beacon  Hill  (discussed  below),  all  intersections  were  assumed  to 
have  identical  configurations  and  traffic  controls  under  2030  conditions.    However,  it  was 
assumed  that  the  City  would  continue  to  refine  and  optimize  traffic  signal  timings  over  the  next 
20  years.    Detailed  LOS  analysis  calculation  sheets  for  2030  conditions  are  provided  in 
Appendices F and G. 

As  described  in  Chapter  1,  the  City  is  proposing  to  increase  the  building  heights  and  land  use 
densities  for  portions  of  each  of  the  neighborhood  planning  areas.  The  local  neighborhood  plan 
updates  refer  to  these  specific  areas  as  Town  Centers.    This  additional  height  and  density  will 
allow  for  development  beyond  for  what  is  expected  to  happen  by  2030  assuming  no  change  in 
the  land  use  code.  The  additional  height  and  density  is  proposed  for  these  areas  for  the 
following reasons: 



                                                                                                                6

           Provide opportunities to meet citywide demands for additional housing and 
           employment 
           Clustering new development around highquality transit minimizes the traffic related 
           greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with new development 
           Provides opportunities to revitalize underutilized parcels and to bring additional public 
           and private investments to the neighborhood areas 

Table  2  summarizes  the  growth  in  households  and  employment  anticipated  to  occur  between 
2010  and  2030  under  No  Action  and  With  Action  alternatives  for  each  study  area.  Maps 
identifying  the  station  areas  are  presented  as  Figures  5,  9,  and  13.    The  No  Action  growth 
forecasts  are  based  on  land  use  data  in  the  Seattle  travel  model  and  the  With  Action  growth 
forecasts  are  based  on  data  from  DPD.    As  shown  in  Table  2,  the  amount  of  growth 
accommodated  by  the  additional  height  and  density  is  relatively  modest  with  the  largest 
increase projected to occur in Mount Baker (419 additional households and employees). 

The  existing  household  and  employment  numbers  represent  information  from  stationarea

immediate  station  areas,  but  most  future  growth  is  expected  to  occur  within  the  areas 
surrounding  the  light  trail  stations.   These  data  show  relatively  minor  growth  in  Beacon  Hill,  but 
a sizeable increase in housing units near the Mount Baker and Othello Station areas.

Trip Generation

To determine the number of PM peak period trips resulting from the No Action and With Action 
alternatives,  Fehr  &  Peers  used  an  innovative  trip  generation  analysis  technique,  known  as  the 
mixeduse  development  (MXD)  tool.    The  MXD  tool  is  based  on  a  growing  body  of  research, 
which  focuses  on  the  relationship  between  travel  and  the  built  environment.  This  method 
supplements  conventional  trip  generation  methods  to  capture  effects  related  to  built 
environment  variables  (known  as  the  Ds)  such  as  density,  diversity  of  land  uses,  destinations 
(accessibility),  development  scale,  pedestrian  and  bicycle  design,  and  distance  to  transit 
services, and demographics.  

The  proposed  increase  in  density  adjacent  to  existing  highquality  transit  service  influence  trip 
generation  in  the  neighborhood  in  a  different  manner  than  comparable  levels  of  growth  in  a 
more  suburban  setting.   Travelers  have  more  travel  mode  alternatives  and  are  closer  to  a  wider 
array  of  trip  destinations.  Using  the  MXD  tool  to  develop  trip  generation  estimates  avoids 
overestimating  the  number  of  vehicle  trips  that  infill/transitoriented  development  projects 
generate  and  provides  a  more  reasonable  picture  of  how  travel  characteristics  change  over 
time.  

Traditional  trip  generation  methodologies  are  not  well  suited  to  analyze  height  and  density 
increases  near  transit  stations.  These  methods  often  take  trip  generation  estimates  from  the 
Institute  of  Transportation  Engineers  (ITE)  and  factor  the  results  using  mode  split  data  from  the 
City's travel model, US Census Bureau, or engineering judgment.  

While  traditional  trip  generation  methods  can  account  for  the  high  share  of  nonauto  modes  in 
the  City,  they  have  limited  ability  to  consider  shifts  in  mode  choice  caused  by  density  changes 
near transit for the following reasons: 

         Typical mode split adjustments tend to assume continuation of current trends and have 
         limited responsiveness to changes in the land use and the built environment (e.g., 
         increased density, increased mix of uses) or transportation system (e.g., improved 
         pedestrian and bicycle connectivity, improved transit service). 
         Mode split data are often derived from the US Census Bureau. As time passes the mode 
         split estimates may not be applicable given changes in development patterns and 
         socioeconomic conditions.  

The  MXD  tool  overcomes  many  of  these  shortcomings  and  explicitly  accounts  for  how  built 
environment  variables,  such  as  building  forms,  the  mix  of  land  uses  (jobs/housing  balance), 
densities,  transit  accessibility,  and  neighborhood  connectivity,  affect  travel  behavior  and  mode 
choice.  

The MXD tool was developed in cooperation with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
and  the  Institute  of  Transportation  Engineers  (ITE).  Over  200  mixeduse  development  sites 
across  the  United  States  were  surveyed  as  part  of  the  model  development  process  and  the  tool

was  validated  using  data  from  16  independent  mixed  use  sites.  Additional  details  regarding  the 
tool development, validation, and implementation can be found in Appendix H.   

Figure  1  compares  the  traditional  trip  generation  methodology  to  the  enhanced  MXD  model 
applied  for  this  analysis.  Table  3  summarizes  the  PM  peak  hour  trip  generation  results  from  the

The  results  from  the  MXD  tool  demonstrate  that  at  North  Beacon  and  Othello,  the  proposed 
increase  to  density  and  diversity  of  development  will  generate  a  higher  percentage  of  walking 
and  cycling  trips  versus  no  action  growth.   This  effect  is  less  pronounced  at  Mount  Baker,  which 
already  has  more  density  and  a  greater  mix  of  uses;  however,  the  transit,  walking,  and  cycling 
mode shares all increase slightly in the Mount Baker neighborhood as well. 

The  largest  increase  in  PM  peak  hour  transit  ridership  due  to  the  increase  in  building  height 
limits  and  density  is  forecasted  for  Mount  Baker  with  a  net  increase  of  53  transit  trips.  Due  to 
the  large  amount  of  current  capacity  on  transit  facilities  (including  LINK  and  King  County  Metro 
bus operations), it is not expected that this small increase will constitute an impact.   

The  trip  generation  results  from  the  MXD  tool  were  input  directly  into  the  Seattle  travel  model 
for each of the three neighborhood areas for both 2030 No Action and With Action alternatives.  
Traffic  associated  with  growth  outside  of  the  three  study  areas  was  estimated  using  the  Seattle 
travel  model's  default  trip  generation  data.    Using  this  combination  of  the  MXD  tool  and  the

Under existing conditions, congestion is generally light with modest delays 
at  15th  Avenue/Beacon  Avenue  intersection.    The  Forest  Street/  17th 
Avenue/Beacon  Avenue  intersection  has  a  higher  delay,  but  this  delay  is 
for  vehicles  making  left  turns  from  the  westbound  stop  sign  controlled 
approach.    This  intersection  has  an  unusual  design  with  five  legs,  which 
can  lead  to  additional  side  street  delay  since  there  is  more  conflicting 
traffic to watch for before making a turn.

The  overall  average  delay  at  the  Forest  Street/17th  Avenue/Beacon  Avenue  intersection  delay  is 
about 5 seconds.  To address some of these unusual design details, the City is proposing a series 
of  modifications  at  this  location  in  conjunction  with  overall  streetscape  improvements  along 
Beacon  Avenue.    These  improvements  are  described  in  detail  in  Appendix  A,  and  briefly 
discussed  in  the  Future  Conditions 
section below.  

NORTH BEACON HILL
FUTURE CONDITIONS

As identified  previously in  Table 2, a 
modest  amount  of  growth  can  be 
accommodated  under  current 
zoning  and  land  use  patterns  in  the 
Beacon  Hill  Neighborhood  Planning 
Area  by  2030.    Specifically,  the 
Seattle  model  estimates  that  this 
area  will  gain  2  jobs  and  158 
households  between  existing  and 
2030 conditions.                                North Beacon Hill Town Center with Proposed Height and
                                                Density Increases
The  proposed  height  and  density

increases  in  the  Beacon  Hill 
Neighborhood  Planning  Area  will 
result in an additional 20 jobs and 213 households when compared to the No Action alternative.  
This  increase  to  housing  options  close  to  the  light  rail  station  is  consistent  with  a  goal  stated  in 
the North Beacon Hill Neighborhood Plan Update from January 2010. 

Fehr & Peers' analysis determined  that  this increase in land use will add approximately 110 new 
PM  peakperiod  vehicle  trips  in  the  Beacon  Hill  Neighborhood  Planning  Area  when  compared  to 
No  Action  conditions.  The  additional  land  uses  will  also  add  approximately  30  bike/walking  trips 
and 20 transit trips. 

As  mentioned  earlier,  the  City  of  Seattle  is  considering  streetscape  improvements  along  Beacon 
Avenue  between  15th  Avenue  and  Spokane  Street.   Appendix  A  describes  the  proposed  changes 
in detail; however, the main changes are summarized below: 

         Installation of a planted median between Forest Street and Spokane Avenue with a full 
         access intersection at Hanford Street 
         Installation of backin angled parking between 15th Avenue and Lander Street and 
         between McClellan Street and Forest Street 




                                                                                                                 19

As  described  in  Appendix  A,  the  median  would  eliminate  left  turns  from 
certain  side  streets  and  vehicle  access  to/from  17th  Avenue  at  Forest 
Street  would  be  eliminated  to  reduce  the  complexity  of  the  Beacon 
Avenue/Forest  Street  intersection.    Both  of  these  modifications  lead  to 
an  increase  in  volume  at  the  Beacon  Avenue/McClellan  Street                        
intersection, particularly for vehicles making a westbound left turn.                     What if 17th Avenue 
                                                                                          / Forest Street

The  increased  land  use  intensity  within  the  neighborhood  planning  area  results  in  a  very  small 
increase in delay at the two signalized study intersections.  At the Forest Street /Beacon Avenue 
intersection, the analysis results show a small decrease in delay (even with higher volumes north 
and  southbound).    However,  this  improvement  in  traffic  conditions  would  not  generally  be 
perceptible and overall the operations at this intersection will be the same under No Action and 
With Action alternatives. In summary, the increased heights and densities within the Beacon Hill 
Neighborhood Planning Area do not result in a significant impact to traffic operations within the 
study area. 

Table 5 shows that the Forest Street/Beacon Avenue intersection is expected to operate at LOS E 
conditions  under  No  Project  and  With  Project  alternatives.  While  LOS  E  operations  typically 
constitute  unacceptable  performance  in  the  City  of  Seattle,  an  impact  was  not  defined  at  this 
location  because  the  With  Project  alternative  will  not  lead  to  a  further  degradation  in  traffic 



                                                                                                          20

flow  at  this  location.   However,  given  the  congestion  level  at  this  intersection,  Fehr  &  Peers  did 
evaluate  potential  traffic  control  improvements.    An  allway  stop  was  evaluated,  but  the  high 
traffic volumes on Beacon Avenue would result in LOS F conditions.  A traffic signal would result 
in  acceptable  operations  at  the  intersection;  however,  volumes  on  Forest  Street  do  not  meet  a 
signal  warrant.    Due  to  the  dense  street  grid  in  the  area,  if  delays  regularly  occur  at  this 
intersection,  motorists  may  choose  to  use  an  alternate  route  (likely  via  the  McClellan  Street 
intersection) during peak traffic periods. 

As  outlined  in  Appendix  A,  bicycle  lanes  are  proposed  for  Beacon  Avenue  from  McClellan  Street 
to  Spokane  Street.    These  will  improve  bicycle  mobility  in  the  neighborhood.    However,  even 
with  the  existing  network  of  bicycle  and  pedestrian  facilities,  the  additional  pedestrian  and 
bicycle  trips  associated  with  the  increased  building  heights  and  density  will  not  lead  to  any 
significant  impacts  to  bicycle  or  pedestrian  travel.  No  transit  impacts  are  anticipated  at  this 
location  either  as  the  modest  increase  in  transit  trips  (21  PM  peak  hour  trips)  will  be 
accommodated by the future transit service in the area. 

Figures  7  and  8,  below,  detail  the  PM  peak  hour  intersection  volumes  and  lane  configurations 
for Beacon Hill under 2030 No Action and 2030 With Action conditions.

CHAPTER 4. OTHELLO STATION AREA
The  Othello  Station  Area  is  centered  around  the  LINK  Light  Rail  station  at  the  Othello 
Street/Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.  Way  (MLK  Way)  intersection.    It  extends  approximately  from 
Willow  Street  on  the  north  to  Kenyon  Street  on  the  south.   In  this  area,  MLK  Way  provides  two 
north  and  south  travel  lanes  separated  by  the  atgrade  light  rail  lines  in  the  median.   Eastwest 
travel  across  the  light  rail  line  is  allowed  at  Myrtle  Street,  Othello  Street,  Webster  Street 
(providing  access  to  Renton  Avenue),  and  Kenyon  Street. Figure  9  identifies  the  project  area 
and  study  intersections,  and  Figure  10  provides  the  existing  intersection  volumes  and  lane 
configurations. 

In  addition  to  existing  and  future  conditions,  Appendix  B  presents  the  traffic  operations  results 
of  allowing  offpeak  parking  in  the  right  lane  of  MLK  Way  in  the  area  under  current  traffic 
conditions.   The  results  indicate  that  parking  can  be  allowed  at  all  times  except  3:00  PM  ­  7:00 
PM  in  the  northbound  and  southbound  directions,  and  7:00  AM  ­  9:00  AM  in  the  northbound 
direction. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS

Table  6  lists  the  existing  intersection  LOS  and  delay  for  the  study  intersections  in  Othello. All 
intersections  generally  experience  limited  congestion  with  modest  delay  during  peak  periods  at 
Othello Street/MLK Way.

FUTURE (2030) CONDITIONS

As  previously  identified  in  Table  2,  the  proposed  height  and  density  increases  in  the  Othello 
Neighborhood  Planning  Area  will  add  approximately  an  additional  100  households  and  100  jobs 
compared  to  No  Action  conditions.   This  additional  development  is  consistent  with  the  goal  of 
maintaining  a  balance  of 
affordable  housing  and  a  vibrant 
commercial  center  expressed  in 
the  January  2010  Othello 
Neighborhood Plan Update.  These 
additional  households  and  jobs 
are  projected  to  add  an  additional 
136  PM  peak  period  vehicle  trips, 
37  additional  bicycle  and 
pedestrian  trips,  and  26  transit 
trips. 

In  addition  to  the  trips  related  to 
additional  development  within 
the  neighborhood  planning  area,  Othello Town Center with Proposed Height and Density
the  Seattle  travel  model  predicts  Increases
substantial  increases  in  traffic  Othello Neighborhood Plan Update, January 2010
volumes on MLK Way (up to a 40 
percent  increase  over  2010  conditions).   Even  with  this  degree  of  increase  and  the  addition  of 
projectrelated  trips,  all  study  intersections  are  forecasted  to  perform  at  acceptable  levels  and 
no significant transportation impacts are anticipated from the height and density increase. 

Given the robust pedestrian infrastructure in the area, no impact is expected from the additional 
bicycle  and  pedestrian  volumes  due  to  the  proposed  increase  in  height  and  density. 
Furthermore, the modest increase in transit trips (26 PM peak hour trips) will be accommodated 
by the robust transit service in the area.  

Table  7,  below,  identifies  the  2030  intersection  LOS  and  delay  for  both  the  No  Action  and  With 
Action  alternatives.    Figures  11  and  12  provide  the  2030  No  Action  and  2030  With  Action 
intersection volumes and lane configurations.

CHAPTER 5. MOUNT BAKER STATION AREA
The  Mount  Baker  neighborhood  Planning  Area  is  focused  along  Rainier  Avenue  and  Martin 
Luther King  Jr. Way  (MLK  Way) between Bayview Street on the  north and Hanford Street on the 
south.   A  key  focus  of  this  analysis  is  the  major  intersection  of  Rainier  Avenue/MLK  Way  which 
currently intersect at a skewed angle.  This intersection is located directly adjacent to the Mount 
Baker Light Rail Station and has a large volume of both pedestrian and vehicle traffic.   

EXISTING CONDITIONS

Table  8  lists  existing  intersection  conditions  in  the  Mount  Baker  Neighborhood  Planning  Area.  
Figure  13  identifies  the  project  area  and  study  intersections,  and  Figure  14  provides  the  existing 
intersection volumes and lane configurations.

As  shown  in  Table  8,  all  intersections  in  the  study  area  operate  acceptably  under  existing 
conditions.   It  may  come  as  a  surprise  that  the  Rainier  Avenue/MLK  Way  intersection  operates 
at  LOS  C  under  existing  conditions,  with  an  average  of  26  seconds  of  delay  per  vehicle.    This 
result  is  partially  a  limitation  of  the  intersection  LOS  methodology,  since  the  delays  at  this 
intersection  affect  not  only  traffic  at  Rainier  Avenue  and  MLK  Way,  but  also  upstream 
intersections  like  Rainier  Avenue/Forest  Street  and  Rainier  Avenue/McClellan  Street.    Field 
observations  in  the  PM  peak  hour  confirm  the  results  in  Table  8.  Most  legs  of  the  Rainier 
Avenue/MLK  Way  intersection  operate  fairly  well;  however,  southbound  traffic  on  Rainier 
Avenue  can  back  up  into  the  upstream  intersections.    In  particular,  this  southbound  traffic 
congestion  tends  to  degrade  operations  at  the  Rainier  Avenue/McClellan  Avenue  intersection, 
which  is  reflected  in  its  relatively 
high  delay  (compared  to  the  other 
intersections in the study area).   

FUTURE (2030) CONDITIONS

As  indicated  previously,  the 
additional  heights  and  density 
proposed  for  this  area  will  increase 
the  number  of  households  in  2030 
by  249  and  the  number  of  jobs  by 
170.    A  neighborhood  town  center 
development  that  concentrates 
housing  (including  a  diversity  of 
housing  options),  commercial,  and 
                                            Mount Baker Town Center with Proposed Height and
employment  options  adjacent  to  Density Increases
the  existing  transit  infrastructure 
was  a  goal  identified  in  the  January  North Rainier Neighborhood Plan Update, January 2010
2010  North  Rainier  Neighborhood 
Plan Update.  These proposed height and density changes will help accomplish this goal. 

As with the other study areas, increases in household and employment will increase the number 
of  trips  generated  in  the  area.    However,  due  to  the  rich  transit  opportunities  and  additional 
locations to live, shop and  work within the same area, many of these trips will not involve a car. 
In  the  PM  peak  hour,  Fehr  &  Peers  analysis  concludes  that  these  increases  will  create  an 
additional  226  vehicle  trips,  72  additional  pedestrian  and  bicycle  trips,  and  53  transit  trips.  Table 
9  below  shows  the  2030  PM  peak  hour  intersection  operating  conditions  under  No  Action  and 
With Action alternatives.

As  Table  9  indicates,  there  are  no  significant  adverse  impacts  to  traffic  operations  as  a  result  of 
the  increased  building  heights  and  densities.   Background  growth  in  the  corridor  is  expected  to  
increase  traffic  by  as  much  as  40  percent.   Such  growth  constitutes  the  bulk  of  the  increase  in 
delay  when  compared  to  existing  conditions.    However,  even  with  this  large  increase  in 
background  traffic,  the  proposed  increase  in  heights  and  densities  will  only  slightly  increase 
delay  at  the  study  intersections  along  the  Rainier  Avenue  and  MLK  Way  corridors.   As  shown  in 
Table  9,  congestion  is  expected  to  increase  at  the  Rainier  Avenue/MLK  Way  intersection  under 
2030  conditions;  however,  overall  operations  are  still  expected  to  be  within  the  City's  LOS 
standard.

Figures 15 and 16 provide the 2030 intersection volumes and lane configurations. 

In  conducting  a  survey  of  pedestrian  facilities  in  the  area,  it  was  noted  that  Hanford  Street 
between  MLK  Way  and  Rainier  Avenue  and  the  east  side  of  MLK  Way  north  of  McClellan  Street 
in  the  study  area  are  both  lacking  sidewalks.   Due  to  the  increase  in  pedestrian  volumes  related 
to  the  increase  in  local  development  and  density,  there  is  a  potential  impact  to  pedestrian 
circulation  at  these  locations  given  the  lack  of  pedestrian  facilities.    As  mitigation,  it  is 
recommended that sidewalks be provided at  both locations concurrent with  the redevelopment 
of adjacent parcels. 

Transit  service  is  not  anticipated  to  be  significantly  impacted  in  the  Mount  Baker  area  since  the 
modest  increase  in  transit  trips  (53  PM  peak  hour  trips)  will  be  accommodated  the 
neighborhood's extensive transit system. 

As  a  separate  project,  the  City  of  Seattle  is  exploring  innovative  transportation  system 
improvements  in  the  Mount  Baker  Neighborhood  Planning  Area  in  an  effort  to  improve  the 
pedestrian,  bicycle,  and  transit  environment  in  the  area.   Specifically,  the  City  is  considering  the 
feasibility  of  converting  Rainier  Avenue  and  MLK  Way  into  a  northsouth  couplet  of  one  way 
streets between Bayview  Street and Hanford Street.  Appendix C contains a detailed  description 
of  this  concept,  along  with  traffic  and  transit  operations  under  existing  and  2030  With  Action 
conditions.  In general, the results of this analysis show that certain intersections will experience 
increased delay, but the overall corridor travel times will show slight decreases.  Additionally the 
updated  configuration  will  allow  for  increased  pedestrian  space,  new  bicycle  facilities  on  MLK 
Way, and a dedicated transit lane on Rainier Avenue.

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS
Based  on  output  from  the  Seattle  travel  model,  background  traffic  increases  along  the  major 
thoroughfares are expected to be between 20 and 40 percent in the study areas.  Even with this 
high  level  of  traffic  growth,  the  additional  traffic  generated  by  the  proposed  height  and  density 
increases  in  the  neighborhood  planning  areas  are  not  expected  to  cause  significant  adverse 
transportation impacts to the roadway network.  All three locations benefit from their proximity 
to  existing  transit  services  and  the  increase  in  density  provides  the  ability  for  more  pedestrian 
and bicycle trips.   

In Mount Baker, the lack of sidewalks on Hanford Street and a portion of MLK Way could trigger 
an  impact  for  pedestrians  given  the  additional  expected  pedestrian  activity  related  to  increases 
in  development  and  density.  This  potential  impact  can  be  mitigated  by  constructing  sidewalks 
concurrent with new development. 

The  increased  project  density  is  expected  to  add  between  2153  PM  peak  hour  transit  trips  in 
each  neighborhood.    Based  on  information  from  King  County  Metro  and  Sound  Transit,  each 
area  currently  has  adequate  overall  transit  capacity  (however  King  County  Metro  Route  7  can 
experience crowding during peak times).  Given the robust transit system in the study areas and 
the  relatively  small  increase  in  transit  trips  as  a  result  of  the  height  and  density  increases,  no 
transit related impacts are anticipated. 

The  appendices  to  this  report  evaluate  future  design  options  for  the  North  Beacon  Hill  and 
Mount  Baker  Neighborhood  Planning  Areas.    These  design  options  provide  benefits  for  non
motorized  travel  and  will  also  help  in  accommodating  neighborhood  growth  by  providing 
options  for  local  residents  to  reach  neighborhood  destinations  by  foot  or  bicycle.    A  final 
appendix  evaluates  the  potential  for  onstreet  parking  along  MLK  Way  in  the  Othello 
neighborhood.  The results indicate that parking can be allowed except from 3:00 PM ­ 7:00 PM 
in  the  northbound  and  southbound  directions,  and  from  7:00  AM  ­  9:00  AM  in  the  northbound 
direction.

APPENDIX A ­ NORTH BEACON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN PROPOSAL ANALYSIS

Fehr  &  Peers  analyzed  numerous  potential  design  options  as  requested  by  the  City  of  Seattle.   Many  of 
these design options have their origin in the January 2010 North Beacon Hill Neighborhood Plan Update.  
This  plan  update  contained  the  goal  to  make  North  Beacon  Hill  a  pleasant  place  to  walk  with 
streetscapes that improve pedestrian and bicycle mobility. 

Figure A1, below identifies current roadway conditions in the North Beacon Hill area.  Currently, Beacon 
Avenue  features  a  center  twoway  left  turn  lane  from  Lander  Street  south  to  Spokane  Street.    Most 
intersections  along  this  segment  have  stop  signs  on  the  minor  approaches  with  full  signals  at  15th 
Avenue/Beacon  Avenue,  McClellan  Street/Beacon  Avenue,  and  Spokane  Street/Beacon  Avenue.  
Additionally, there is a pedestrianactivated signal at the Hanford Street/Beacon Avenue intersection.   

The  North  Beacon  Hill  Neighborhood  Plan  Update  recommends  the  following  pedestrian  environment 
and traffic calming improvements for Beacon Avenue: 

             Removal of the twoway left turn lane and addition of backin angle parking on one side of 
             Beacon Avenue from 15th Avenue South to Lander Street and between McClellan Street and 
             Forest Street. 
             Removal of the twoway left turn lane and a narrowing of the street between Lander Street and 
             McClellan Street. 
             Removal of the twoway left turn lane and addition of raised, planted medians on Beacon 
             Avenue from McClellan Street to Spokane Street1. 
             Addition of bicycle lanes on Beacon Avenue from McClellan Street to Spokane Street per the 
             Seattle Bicycle Master Plan. 

Potential  transportation  issues  related  to  the  proposed  improvements  and  Fehr  &  Peers 
recommendations are summarized below.  Recommendations are also detailed on Figure A2.

also removes the risk that  a motorist may open a door into the path of a               McClellan

Landscaped Median/Beacon Avenue Channelization

In  addition  to  the  parking  and  streetscape  enhancements  described  above,  the  North  Beacon  Hill 
Neighborhood  Plan  Update  identified  the  desire  to  add  planted  medians  along  Beacon  Avenue  between 
Spokane  Street  and  Lander  Street.  This  section  described  potential  design  details  related  to  a  planted 
median.  

Parking Considerations

Replacing  the  existing  twoway  left  turn  lane  on  Beacon  Avenue  between  Spokane  Street  and  Lander 
Street  with  a  landscaped  median  accomplishes  the  community's  desire  for  a  green  connection  between 
the  light  rail  station  area  and  Jefferson  Park.  However,  to  accommodate  a  1011foot  landscaped 
median and the bicycle lanes recommended in the Seattle Bicycle Master Plan, onstreet parallel parking 
would  have  to  be  eliminated  from  one  side  of  the  street.2  This  design  would  result  in  a  loss  of 
approximately  75  spaces  (see  Table  A2  for  a  detailed  accounting  of  parking  spaces  lost).  Based  on  a 
review of the land uses along Beacon Avenue, Fehr & Peers recommends eliminating parking on the east 
side  of  the  street  for  the  entire  length  between  Lander  Street  and  Spokane  Street.  Most  of  the 
businesses are located along the west side of Beacon Avenue and eliminating parking on the east side of 
the street would inconvenience fewer retail patrons. 

Almost  all  of  the  curb  spaces  removed  would  be  in  front  of  residential  properties.    Underutilized 
driveway  and  alley  spaces  are  likely  to  only  add  a  minimal  amount  of  potential  parking.    Alleys  in  the 
affected  area  are  only  located  on  blocks  on  the  west  side  of  Beacon  Avenue  and  are  too  narrow  to 
accommodate  parking.    Driveway  entrances  on  Beacon  Avenue  are  limited,  however,  aerial  photos 
indicate  that  there  are  unused  parking  spots  on  18th  Avenue,  which  is  the  street  immediately  east  of 
Beacon Avenue.  Figure A4 shows the potential road configuration with medians and parking restrictions 
on Beacon Avenue near Hanford Street.

  An  alternative  proposal  is  to  provide  a  fourfoot  wide  landscaped  median.   This  narrow  median  would  allow  parking  lanes  to 
remain on both sides of Beacon Avenue.

Related recommendations to channelizing Beacon Avenue

In addition to parking changes, Fehr & Peers recommends other changes to Beacon Avenue.  These are: 

        Left Turn Locations.   Where the median is installed, local vehicle access to driveways on Beacon 
        Avenue and local streets will be restricted to right turns only. However, a mountable median 
        design with pedestrian and bicycle permeability should be implemented to accommodate active 
        transportation modes and emergency vehicles.   To provide local circulation, we recommend 
        allowing left turns from Beacon Avenue at Forest Street, Hanford Street, and Spokane Street.  
        Forest and Hanford Streets would require 50 foot left turn pockets.  The existing left turn pocket 
        at Spokane Street should remain.   
         
         




                                                                                                         7

        Bicycle Facilities.  The Seattle Bicycle Master Plan recommends bicycle lanes on Beacon Avenue 
        from McClellan Street through the southern end of the study area. By removing the center turn 
        lanes and parking on one side of the street, bike lanes can be accommodated within the existing 
        rightofway (ROW).  This design would provide a sevenfoot wide parallel parking lane on the 
        west side of Beacon Avenue, sixfoot bicycle lanes on both sides of the street, and two 11foot 
        travel lanes.  This configuration leaves sufficient ROW for a 1011foot wide median for planting.  
        At intersections that permit leftturn traffic, the median should be eliminated to accommodate 
        left turn pockets that are 50feet long.  Curb extensions (in the parking lane) at intersections to 
        reduce pedestrian crossing distance are also recommended. 
         
        Bus Stop Locations.  The removal of parking from the east side of Beacon Avenue will mean that 
        buses using existing stops at Spokane Street, Hinds Street, Hanford Street, and Stevens Street 
        will block the bicycle lane and part of the throughlane when making stops.  While this 
        configuration will generally allow vehicles to pass the bus (with the exception of wide vehicles 
        and large trucks), we recommend that a bus bay be created immediately north of Hanford 
        Street, at the location of the existing bus stop.  This bus bay can be created by eliminating 34 
        parking spaces on the west side of Beacon Avenue approaching Hanford Street and shifting the 
        lanes and median over eight feet to accommodate the bus bay.  This potential bus bay 
        configuration is shown on Figure A4.

17th Avenue / Forest Street / Beacon Avenue Intersection

The City recently made some changes at this intersection (e.g., removed rightturn channelization on the 
southbound  approach from 17th Avenue) to improve sight lines and pedestrian/bicycle travel.  However, 
this  intersection  still  has  an  unusual  5legged  configuration  that  can  be  difficult  to  negotiate  for  all 
modes.   For  example,  vehicles  travelling  northbound  on  Beacon  Avenue  can  make  an  unimpeded  right 
turn onto 17th Avenue northbound at relatively high speed. Such movements make pedestrian crossings 
more  difficult.  Additionally,  turning  from  17th  Avenue  onto  Beacon  Avenue  can  be  difficult  because 
motorists  have  to  watch  for  gaps  in  traffic  on  both  Beacon  Avenue  and  Forest  Street.    Due  to 
background  traffic  growth  on  Beacon  Avenue,  this  intersection  is  expected  to  perform  at  LOS  F  in  2030, 
due to long delays at the sidestreet approaches.

To reduce vehicle and  pedestrian conflicts at  this intersection, Fehr & Peers recommends closing off the 
northbound  and  southbound  17th  Avenue  approaches.   Curb  cuts  should  be  provided  to  retain  bicycle 
and  pedestrian  access  between  Beacon  Avenue  and  17th  Avenue.    Current  traffic  volumes  are  low  on 
both  approaches  with  approximately  70  southbound  and  25  northbound  vehicles  during  the  peak  PM 
hour.    Traffic  on  the  north  leg  of  17th  Avenue  can  easily  access  Beacon  Avenue  via  the  signalized 
intersection at McClellan Street, and traffic on the south leg of 17th Street can access Beacon Avenue via 
Stevens Street or Forest Street (via 16th Avenue).

The  Seattle  RightofWay  Improvements  Manual  (section  4.22)  notes  that  culdesacs  are  required  at  all 
street deadends.  The manual provides culdesac designs for new platted streets and for streets within 
an  existing  60foot  rightofway  (ROW).   Culdesac  specifications  for  construction  within  existing  ROW 
have  a  turnaround  width  of  approximately  40  feet.    To  the  north  of  Beacon  Avenue,  17th  Avenue  is 
approximately  30  feet  wide.    To  the  south,  it  is  approximately  25  feet  wide.    The  City  would  need  to 
expand  the  existing  road  footprint  to  construct  culdesacs  to  meet  city  specifications.   This  expansion 
would entail paving over existing green space and possible ROW acquisition. 

Alternatives  to  standard  culdesac  designs  that  would  not  require  road  footprint  expansion  require 
approval  of  the  SDOT  director,  which  may  be  warranted  due  to  the  short  segment  length  and  local 
neighborhood  grid.    The  southern  road  segment  approaching  the  culdesac  would  be  approximately 
150  feet  in  length,  fronting  three  homes.   The  northern  road  segment  would  be  approximately  230  feet 
in length.  If a culdesac is not constructed to SDOT specifications, it should include mountable curbs for 
emergency vehicles to maintain northsouth travel on 17th Avenue.

Figure A5 shows the proposed intersection reconfiguration. 

Conclusions

North  Beacon  Hill  benefits  from  having  a  dense  street  grid  and  relatively  welldeveloped  pedestrian 
amenities.   Additionally,  the  wealth  of  transit  options  provides  mobility  options  for  local  residents  and 
neighborhood  visitors.    The  proposed  design  changes  reviewed  in  this  document  will  further  improve 
bicycle  and  pedestrian  mobility  by  providing  dedicated  bicycle  lanes  on  Beacon  Avenue  and  potentially 
more  pedestrian  space  near  the  existing  Beacon  Hill  LINK  light  rail  station.   Additionally,  the  landscaped 
median will provide a visually attractive green connection between the neighborhood and Jefferson Park 
to  the  south.    It  will  also  concentrate  eastwest  movements  across  and  from  Beacon  Avenue,  thus 
improving pedestrian conditions north and south on Beacon Avenue.

APPENDIX B ­ MLK WAY PARKING STUDY, OTHELLO STATION AREA

To  provide  extra  parking  opportunities  in  the  Othello  Station  area,  Fehr  &  Peers  analyzed  the  option  of 
converting  the  existing  right  lane  of  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  (MLK)  Way  between  Willow  Street  and 
Webster  Street  into  a  parking  lane  during  nonpeak  periods.   Such  a  configuration  would  likely  have  a 
side benefit of calming traffic on the corridor and facilitating easier pedestrian crossings of MLK Way.   

Traffic  volume  data  on  northbound  and  southbound  MLK  Way  south  of  the  Myrtle  Street  intersection 
was  collected  for  48  consecutive  hours  on  WednesdayThursday  November  1718,  2010.    Full  results 
from these counts are provided at the end of this Appendix. 

The counts show that on northbound MLK Way between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM, the volume of traffic is 
approximately  1730  percent  lower  than  during  either  the  AM  or  PM  peak  period.   On  southbound  MLK 
Way,  there  is  a  no  pronounced  peak  in  AM  volume.   Rather,  volume  builds  throughout  the  day  with  a 
PM peak period beginning at 3:00PM.  Between the hours of 10:00AM and 3:00PM, the volume of traffic 
southbound is approximately 2746 percent lower than the PM peak period.

Southbound Parking  

Under existing conditions a single southbound through lane provides adequate capacity to maintain LOS 
of C or better at all times except between 3:007:00 PM.  Therefore, Fehr & Peers recommends allowing 
parking  with  only  a  PM  peak  period  restriction.   While  not  necessary  to  maintain  satisfactory  LOS,  Fehr 
&  Peers  recommends  that  parking  be  restricted  within  100  feet  of  the  Othello  Street  intersection  to 
facilitate right turns at the intersection.   




                                                                                                                     1

Northbound Parking  

Unlike the southbound direction, northbound traffic on MLK Way shows a clear AM peak between 7:00
9:00  AM.    There  is  also  a  northbound  peak  in  the  PM  period  between  4:006:00  PM,  however  the 
northbound  volume  is  lower  than  the  southbound  volume  during  the  PM  period.    Outside  of  these 
times,  a  single  northbound  through  lane  provides  adequate  capacity  to  maintain  LOS  of  C  or  better 
through  the  study  area.   Thus,  Fehr  &  Peers  recommends  right  lane  parking  restrictions  between  7:00
9:00 AM.  During the PM peak period, Fehr & Peers recommends parking restrictions between 3:007:00 
PM  (consistent  with  the  restrictions  in  the  southbound  direction).    While  not  necessary  to  maintain 
satisfactory  LOS,  Fehr  &  Peers  recommends  that  parking  be  restricted  within  100  feet  of  the  Othello 
Street intersection to facilitate right turns at the intersection.   

Figure B1 identifies the study area and shows the recommended right turn pocket locations and existing 
bus stop locations where parking will not be allowed.

The City of Blaine ("City") is seeking submittals from engineering firms interested in providing
professional design services to the Public Works Department for the Boblett Street/SR 543
Signalization project. The successful firm will have experience in the design of multi-lane
signalization, intersection channelization, streets, sidewalk improvements, storm water,
pedestrian facilities, right of way acquisition, and construction management for Federal projects.

The City invites all interested parties to respond to this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) by
submitting their qualifications relating to this type of project. All prospective consultants are
advised that federally funded projects will be held to Federal EEO requirements.
Disadvantaged, minority and women-owned consultant firms are encouraged to respond. Upon
consideration of the submittals, the City will negotiate final terms with the selected party.

Blaine Rite-Aid                                                                          October 2012



                                 Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the Final Transportation Impact Analysis for
the proposed Blain Rite-Aid through a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

Where is the project located and what would be developed?
The proposed project is located in the City of Blaine in the southwest corner of the SR 543 /
Boblett Street intersection and is currently used as a truck storage facility. The proposed
project includes the construction of a 17,340 square foot (sf) Rite-Aid drugstore with a drive-
through window. Access to the site will be provided via one driveway on Boblett Street and
one driveway on Fir Avenue.

What are the existing and future without-project conditions in the study
area?
Under typical weekday conditions all study intersections currently operate at LOS B or better
during the PM peak hour. With forecast growth in the area, they will continue to operate at the
same LOS. Queue lengths generally remain within their available storage lanes and do not
extend into any adjacent upstream intersections with one minor exception for the westbound
through lane at Boblett Street / SR 543. It is anticipated that the planned future improvement
at this intersection would alleviate this issue. It is also important to note that traffic conditions
along SR 543 can be greatly impacted by border activity, including delays and queues that
can extend from the border. This occurs a couple of times a week and more frequently during
peak summer and holiday conditions when queues from the border crossing can extend
south beyond the Boblett Street intersection, impacting operations at the study area
intersections.

In addition to these periodic backups, the existing eastbound right-turn lane provided at the
Boblett Street / SR 543 intersection is approximately 60 feet in length with a relatively short
transition area. As a result, eastbound right-turning tractor trailers have been observed
turning right from the center eastbound through lane because of the limited storage area.

Pedestrian facilities connect land uses that attract and/or generate pedestrian traffic,
specifically the adjacent school campus, nearby residential uses, and nearby retail are the
primary generators. Sidewalks and pedestrian facilities are generally provided throughout the
study area, although no sidewalks exist on Boblett Street east of the school driveways
adjacent to the project site. The City of Blaine has plans for a pedestrian connection on
Boblett Street between the School District access and SR 543 but it is currently not funded.

Would the project have any off-site transportation impacts?
The proposed project is anticipated to generate a total of 1,680 vehicle-trips during a typical
weekday with 172 trips during the PM peak hour.

All study area intersections are expected to operate at LOS C or better with the addition of
the traffic generated by the proposed project and meet the City of Blaine LOS D standard.
Under typical weekday PM peak hour conditions, queues generally remain within their
available storage lanes and would not extend into any adjacent upstream intersections due to
the addition of project generated traffic. Traffic conditions along SR 543 would continue to be
impacted by border activity and would not be noticeably impacted by project generated traffic.

What measures are proposed to reduce or control traffic impacts?
Two transportation issues were identified in the study area that are impacted by the proposed
project where mitigation is recommended. This includes increasing traffic volumes on the
west leg of the Boblett Street / SR 543 intersection where a relatively short eastbound right
turn pocket exists, and the lack of dedicated pedestrian connections between the proposed
project site and the schools located north of Boblett Street.

Eastbound Boblett Street Right-Turn Lane
To reduce the impacts of increased traffic volumes on the west leg of the Boblett Street /
SR 543 intersection, the eastbound right-turn lane storage length should be increased along
the frontage of the project to the just before the proposed site access driveway onto Boblett
Street. Constructing this improvement would mitigate the traffic volume increase generated
by the project and provide for improved movement of eastbound right-turning tractor trailers.

Pedestrian Connectivity to School Campus
The City of Blaine 2013-2018 Six-Year Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) identifies
a planned pedestrian connection on Boblett Street between the School District access and
SR 543. To mitigate potential impacts of pedestrian generated traffic between the proposed
project and the schools located north of Boblett Street, the project provide a negotiated
financial contribution towards this improvement. Although specific details of this planned
improvement are not yet finalized, this contribution would be used by the City to help pay for
an initial pedestrian connection between the project and the school campus.

                                    Introduction
The purpose of this traffic study is to evaluate and document the potential traffic impacts
related to the proposed Rite-Aid project located in the City of Blaine, Washington. The scope
of this study was identified through coordination with City staff. A specific study area was
defined for the evaluation of individual intersections and roadways under existing, future
without-project, and future with-project traffic conditions. The following sections describe the
project and study area, establishing the framework for evaluating potential traffic-related
impacts of the proposed project.


Project Description
The proposed project is located in the City of Blaine in the southwest corner of the SR 543 /
Boblett Street intersection. The project location and vicinity are shown in Figure 1.
Specifically, the site is bounded by Boblett Street on the north, SR 543 on the east, Fir
Avenue on the west, and the Blaine School District bus barn on the south. The property is
currently used as a truck storage facility.
The proposed project includes the construction of a 17,340 square foot (sf) Rite-Aid drugstore
with a drive-through window. Access to the site will be provided via one driveway on Boblett
Street and one driveway on Fir Avenue. Figure 2 shows a preliminary site plan and access
locations. This site plan also identifies a second retail pad for future development that is not
part of this current proposal.


Project Study Area
The project study area was identified through coordination with City of Blaine staff. In general,
the study area is limited to the immediate vicinity of the site, and includes the following five
off-site intersections:
         Boblett Street / Yew Avenue
         Boblett Street / SR 543
         Boblett Street / Fir Avenue
         Boblett Street / Mitchell Avenue
         H Street / Mitchell Avenue
An analysis of the weekday PM peak hour was conducted to evaluate the period with the
highest overall combination of site-generated and background street traffic. Operations at the
adjacent intersections and site access driveways were evaluated in terms of level of service
(LOS).

Blaine Rite-Aid                                                                      October 2012



   Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section documents existing and future without-project transportation system conditions
within the study area. The analysis of existing traffic conditions provides a frame of reference
for current conditions, while the future without-project analysis provides a baseline from which
project impacts can be evaluated. The following sections discuss the study area roadway
characteristics, traffic volumes, planned improvements, and intersection operations under
these conditions.


Roadway Network
Local and collector arterials serve various uses within the project vicinity and would
accommodate traffic from the proposed project. The following paragraphs describe these
arterials in more detail.
SR 543 is a two- to four-lane principal arterial that is also a State Route. This roadway
provides access from I-5 to the Pacific Highway Crossing of the United States/Canada border
and is the main truck route for the I-5 border crossing. The posted speed limit is 40 miles per
hour (mph). Traffic conditions along SR 543 vary greatly depending on border activity. At
peak times, queues from the border crossing can extend south beyond the Boblett Street
intersection towards I-5.

H Street is a two-lane, minor arterial roadway that provides access to the City of Blaine and
the areas east of SR 543. The roadway also provides direct access to the Blaine Middle and
High Schools north of the site. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 25 mph in the vicinity
of the site.

Boblett Street is a two-lane, minor collector roadway that extends from Mitchell Avenue on
the west pas Odell Street to the east. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 25 mph and
its intersection with SR 543 is currently signalized. Boblett Street provides access to the
Blaine School District campus north of Boblett Street and east of Mitchell Avenue.

Mitchell Avenue is a two-lane, collector roadway that extends from Peace Portal Drive on
the south to H Street on the north and provides access to Blaine Elementary School. The
roadway has a posted speed limit of 25 mph and its intersections with Boblett Street and H
Street are currently Stop-controlled.

Fir Avenue is a two-lane, local access roadway that extends from Boblett Street south to
serve the industrial uses in the vicinity of the site. The roadway does not currently have a
posted speed limit and its intersection with Boblett Street is controlled by a south-facing Stop
sign.


Pedestrians & Bikes
An assessment of existing and planned pedestrian and bicycle facilities within the project
vicinity was conducted. An inventory of these facilities within a typical walking distance
(approximately ¼ mile) of the project site is shown in Figure 3.

Within walking distance of the project site, sidewalks are provided along both sides of Mitchell
Avenue, and the north side of Boblett Street between Mitchell Avenue and the easternmost
driveway to the school football field. No sidewalks exist on Boblett Street east of the school
driveways but the landscaped area on the north side of Boblett is used to connect to the
crosswalks at the intersection of SR 543 and Boblett Street. These pedestrian facilities
connect land uses that attract and/or generate pedestrian traffic, specifically the schools, the
neighboring households, and nearby retail.

Pedestrian volumes were counted during the afternoon school peak through peak commuting
hours, between 2:00 and 6:00 p.m. Throughout the four hour period, one pedestrian crossed
the west leg of the Fir Avenue/Boblett Street intersection. At the SR 543/Boblett Street
intersection, four pedestrians used the north crosswalk to cross SR 543 during the four hour
period. To the west, the intersection of Mitchell Avenue/Boblett Street saw many more
pedestrians; during the four hour period, 56 pedestrians crossed Boblett Street on the east
leg of the intersection and 46 pedestrians crossed Mitchell Avenue on the north leg of the
intersection. Just under 70 percent of these crossings took place between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m.
and are primarily associated with the with school dismissal times.

The City of Blaine 2013-2018 Six-Year Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) was
reviewed to determine if any non-motorized improvement projects were located in the study
area. One project is identified in the area and it identifies a pedestrian connection on Boblett
Street between the School District access and SR 543. In addition, long-term plans in the City
of Blaine Non-Motorized Transportation Plan show an east-west overpass crossing on the
north leg of the SR 543/Boblett Street intersection and community trail pedestrian facilities
connecting the Blaine Schools Complex to areas east and north of the project site.

Within the study area some roadways are classified as secondary bicycling corridors. Namely
Boblett Street between Mitchell Avenue and SR 543, SR 543 from Boblett Street north to the
border crossing and Mitchell Avenue from H Street south to Peace Portal Drive. Boblett
Street and Mitchell Avenue are shared roadways, while SR 543 has a striped shoulder for
bicyclists. The non-motorized plan does not identify any specific future bicycle improvements
within the study area.


Planned Roadway Capacity Improvements
Based on the City of Blaine 2013 ­ 2018 Six-Year Transportation Improvement Program
(TIP), no improvements to the nearby roadway network are planned to occur prior to 2014.
As a result, the existing intersection geometry was utilized for the future without and with-
project analyses. It should be noted that an improvement project to incorporate Yew Avenue
into the SR 543 / Boblett Street intersection is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2015
but is not included in this analysis. This project would reconfigure the current signal to
incorporate Yew Street, alter the existing intersection channelization, install video cameras
for traffic enforcement, and install permanent signal arms and an approach signal on the
SR 543 off-ramp.


Existing & Future Baseline Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes were collected at the study intersections in
September 2012 and included the number of trucks travelling through each intersection.
Volumes were collected from 2:00 - 6:00 p.m. to capture the peak dismissal of traffic from the
nearby school campus as well as the typical evening commute period. The highest volume
peak hour for each intersection, whether due to the school peak or the commute peak, was
then utilized for the analysis to represent worst case conditions. The peak hour for the Boblett
Street intersections coordinated with the school release; for the Fir Ave/Boblett St and
Mitchell Ave/Boblett Street intersections it was 2:30 ­ 3:30 p.m. and for the SR 543/Boblett St

and Yew Ave/Boblett St it was 2:45 ­ 3:45 p.m. The peak hour for the remaining intersection
of H Street/Mitchell Ave coordinated with the typical commuting peak, occurring from 4:15 ­
5:15 p.m. The detailed count data is included in Appendix A.

Future (2014) baseline traffic volumes were developed by applying an average annual growth
rate of 4 percent per year to the existing traffic counts. This growth rate is based on the
historical growth along SR 543 from WSDOT average daily traffic volumes counts conducted
along SR 543 near Boblett Street as published in the 2011 Annual Traffic Report; these
counts are included in Appendix B. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the existing and future
without-project traffic volumes, respectively, at the study area intersections. Existing and
future projected traffic volumes were rounded to the nearest five vehicles to reflect day-to-day
variance.


Intersection Operations
An LOS analysis and queue length analysis were conducted at each study area intersection
for the weekday PM peak hour. The intersections were analyzed using the Synchro8 capacity
analysis software for both LOS and queue lengths. The LOS methodology in this software
program is based on the latest methodologies presented in the Highway Capacity Manual
2010 (Transportation Research Board) and account for the percentage of trucks travelling
through an intersection. LOS values range from LOS A, indicating good operating conditions
with little or no delay, to LOS F indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. A
more detailed explanation of LOS definitions is provided in Appendix C. Table 1 summarizes
the existing and future baseline LOS for the study intersections. The LOS worksheets are
included in Appendix D. Queue lengths were estimated also using the Synchro8 software
program. A detailed summary of existing and future without-project queue lengths are
provided in Appendix E.

2.   Average delay in seconds per vehicle.
3.   Worst movement (movement or approach experiencing the highest delay) reported for two-way stop-controlled intersections.


As Table 1 shows, all intersections currently operate at LOS B or better during the PM peak
hour. With forecast growth in the area, they will continue to operate at the same LOS. The
analysis indicates that vehicles experience relatively low delay, and additional capacity is
available on the existing street network under average weekday conditions. Queue lengths
summarized in Appendix E show that under typical weekday PM peak hour conditions,
queues generally remain within their available storage lanes and do not extend into any
adjacent upstream intersections with one exception. The westbound through lane queue on
Boblett Street at SR 543 would extend past Yew Avenue by approximately 1 vehicle
(~25 feet)1 under existing and future without-project conditions.

  Calculated queue lengths are all rounded up to the nearest 25 feet which is approximately
the average length of one vehicle plus the bumper-to-bumper gap between two cars.

In addition to the preceding analysis results, it is important to note that traffic conditions along
SR 543 can be greatly impacted by border activity, including delays and queues that can
extend from the border. The Blaine police department was contacted to provide additional
information on these events.2 During peak conditions, queues from the border crossing can
extend south beyond the Boblett Street intersection, impacting operations at the study area
intersections. This occurs a couple of times a week and more frequently during peak summer
and holiday conditions when queues from the border crossing can extend south beyond the
Boblett Street intersection, impacting operations at the study area intersections.

In addition to these periodic backups, the existing eastbound right-turn lane provided at the
Boblett Street / SR 543 intersection is approximately 60 feet in length with a relatively short
transition area. As a result, eastbound right-turning tractor trailers have been observed
turning right from the center eastbound through lane because of the limited storage area.


Transit Operations
Transit service in the study area is provided by Whatcom Transportation Authority (WTA).
The nearest transit stop is located along H Street between Mitchell Avenue and SR 543 and
services WTA routes 55 and 70X. Both routes connect the proposed site to downtown Blaine,
as well as Bitch Bay and the Cities of Ferndale and Bellingham.

Route 55 is a commuter route provides service for the full route twice daily in each direction,
in the afternoon. The rest of the time it runs primarily between Birch Bay and Blaine. Route
70X is a commuter route with service provided twice in each direction during the morning.
During the evening commute service from Bellingham to Blaine is provided three times while
service from Blaine to Bellingham is provided twice.


Collision History
Historical collision data at the two existing study intersections was obtained from the City of
Blaine for the most recent three-year period available (2009-2011). The detailed collision data
was evaluated to assess the recent collision history at the study intersections. Typically,
intersections with collision rates greater than 1.00 collisions per million entering vehicles are
earmarked for continued evaluation and potential safety improvements. Table 2 summarizes
the accident data.

No recorded fatalities combined with accident rates less than 1.00 per million entering
vehicles implies that there are no traffic safety deficiencies that would require further study
within the study area.

                                            Project Impacts
This section of the report identifies the potential transportation-related impacts associated
with the proposed development. In order to establish project impacts, the results of the with-
project analysis are compared to the results of the 2014 without-project conditions analysis.
The following sections describe the project trip generation, trip distribution, and assignment,
as well as the operations and site access impacts of the proposed Rite-Aid project.


Trip Generation
Daily and weekday PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed project was estimated
using rates from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation (9th Edition,
2012). Specifically, rates from the ITE land use Drugstore with Drive-Through Window
(LU 881) were used as that land use most closely represents the proposed project.
In addition to new trips, the project would also generate pass-by trips from the surrounding
roadways, namely SR 543. Pass-by trips represent trips that currently travel on the
surrounding roadways and would visit the site on their way to another destination. Pass-by
trips were estimated based on rates published in Trip Generation (9th Edition) and were
specifically assigned between SR 543 and the driveways.
A summary of the resulting PM peak hour trip generation estimates are provided in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, the proposed project is anticipated to generate a total of 1,680 vehicle-
trips during a typical weekday with 824 attracted from the adjacent roadways and 856 new to
study area roadways. During the weekday PM peak hour, 172 trips are anticipated with 84
attracted from existing traffic and 88 that are new to study area roadways.


Trip Distribution and Assignment
Trip distribution for the proposed project was based on existing traffic patterns in the site
vicinity and the proposed site access. Approximately 50 percent of the traffic is expected to
access the site from the west, or central Blaine, 35 percent from the north and east, and 15
percent from the south. The resulting trip distribution to the surrounding street system is
illustrated in Figure 6. New project trips were assigned to the vicinity roadway system based
on this trip distribution pattern without subtracting any trips generated by the existing Rite-Aid
that will relocate to the proposed site. This provides a conservative analysis of project
generated impacts. In addition, pass-by trips were assigned based on the traffic patterns on
SR 543. Both the new project and pass-by trip assignments are shown in Figure 6.

Traffic Volumes
Future with-project traffic volumes were estimated by adding project generated traffic shown
in Figure 6 to the future without-project traffic volumes shown in Figure 5 (page 12). Figure 7
summarizes the resulting weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes for 2014 with-project
conditions.

The greatest increase in traffic volumes occurs on the west leg of the Boblett Street / SR 543
intersection. On this leg, 124 new vehicle trips (accounting for new trips and pass-by trips)
are assigned and increase traffic volumes approximately 40 percent over existing conditions.
On this leg, the greatest percentage increase would occur for the eastbound right-turn
movement where volumes would increase from 45 vehicles to 73, an increase of
approximately 60 percent. Proposed improvements to reduce potential impacts of this volume
increase are presented in the mitigation section.


Intersection Operations Impacts
An LOS and queuing analysis were conducted at the study area intersections for the future
2014 PM peak hour with-project condition. Results of the with-project analysis were
compared to the results of the baseline analysis to identify the potential impacts of the
proposed project. The results of the LOS analysis are summarized in Table 4 and the
queuing analysis is summarized in Appendix E.

2.   Average delay in seconds per vehicle.
3.   Worst movement (movement or approach experiencing the highest delay) reported for two-way stop-controlled intersections.


As Table 4 shows, all study area intersections are expected to operate at LOS C or better
with the addition of the traffic generated by the proposed project. As a result, they meet the
City of Blaine's LOS D standard. In addition, average vehicle delays would increase by no
more than 2 seconds per vehicle. Queue lengths summarized in Appendix E show that under
typical weekday PM peak hour conditions, queues generally remain within their available
storage lanes and would not extend into any adjacent upstream intersections with the
addition of project generated traffic. The westbound through spacing on Boblett Street at
SR 543 that is exceeded under existing and future without-project conditions would not be
increased by the addition of project generated traffic. The anticipated improvement project at
this intersection is likely to address this need for additional queue storage but will not be
constructed before the propose pharmacy is completed.

It is important to note that traffic conditions along SR 543 would continue to be impacted by
border activity, including delays and queues that can extend from the border as previously
described. During peak conditions, queues from the border crossing could continue to
occasionally extend south beyond the Boblett Street intersection, impacting operations at the
study area intersections.

Under future conditions, the eastbound right-turn lane at the Boblett Street / SR 543
intersection would remain very short in length. As previously noted, eastbound right-turning
tractor trailers have been observed turning right from the center eastbound through lane
because of the short eastbound right-turn storage that cannot accommodate a tractor trailer
and the tight curb radius on the southwest corner of the intersection.


Site Access
Two full-movement site access points are planned for the site, one on Boblett Street and one
on Fir Avenue. An LOS analysis was conducted at the access points to determine their
expected operations in the 2014 PM peak hour with-project condition. The results of the
analysis are summarized in Table 5.

1.   Level of service, based on 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology.
2.   Average delay in seconds per vehicle.
3.   Worst movement (movement or approach experiencing the highest delay) reported for Stop-controlled intersections.
4.   Reported queue length is the 95th-percentile; 95 percent of all queues during the weekday PM peak hour are estimated to be
     shorter than the reported queue.


As shown, all movements at the two site access locations are expected to operate at LOS B
or better during the PM peak hour and queues would be approximately 1 vehicle or less.


Pedestrians & Bikes
With the construction of the proposed project some pedestrian trips are likely to be
generated. As previously identified, the primary generators of pedestrian traffic within the
study area are the schools located north of Boblett Street. As a result, pedestrian traffic is
anticipated to occur between the schools and the proposed project. Under existing conditions
no facilities exist that provide a dedicated pedestrian connection between the schools and the
project site, including no pedestrian pathway/sidewalk connections or crosswalks. Measures
to provide safe pedestrian connectivity between the schools and the proposed project are
further discussed in the mitigation section. As shown in Figure 3 (page 8), on-site pedestrian
pathways and sidewalks will be installed along the project frontages or through the site to
facilitate pedestrian activity through the site to and connect to the Boblett Street/SR 543
intersection.

                          Recommended Mitigation
As identified earlier in this report, two transportation issues were identified in the study area
that are impacted by the proposed project where mitigation is recommended. This includes
increasing traffic volumes on the west leg of the Boblett Street / SR 543 intersection where a
relatively short eastbound right turn pocket exists, and the lack of dedicated pedestrian
connections between the proposed project site and the schools located north of Boblett
Street.

Eastbound Boblett Street Right-Turn Lane
To reduce the impacts of increased traffic volumes on the west leg of the Boblett Street /
SR 543 intersection, the eastbound right-turn lane storage length should be increased along
the frontage of the project to the just before the proposed site access driveway onto Boblett
Street. Constructing this improvement would mitigate the traffic volume increase generated
by the project and provide for improved movement of eastbound right-turning tractor trailers.

Pedestrian Connectivity to School Campus
As previously mentioned, the City of Blaine 2013-2018 Six-Year Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP) identifies a planned pedestrian connection on Boblett Street between the
School District access and SR 543. To mitigate potential impacts of pedestrian generated
traffic between the proposed project and the schools located north of Boblett Street, the
project could provide a negotiated financial contribution towards this improvement. Although
specific details of this planned improvement are not yet finalized, this contribution would be
used by the City to help pay for an initial pedestrian connection between the project and the
school campus.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into three intersection types: all-way stop,
two-way stop, and roundabout control. All-way stop and roundabout control intersection LOS is expressed
in terms of the weighted average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-
controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street
movement (or shared movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street
through vehicles are assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in
very low overall average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor
movements. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                   intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                   determined solely by control delay.

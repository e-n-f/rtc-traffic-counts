EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

OVERVIEW
The primary purpose of this report is to identify and evaluate the potential traffic
impacts associated with the proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton in the
City of Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York. Additionally, pedestrian, bicycle and transit
conditions, considerations and improvements are identified.

The study's primary objective is to evaluate the future impact the proposed
development has on the adjacent intersections and roadways, and to determine what
improvements (if any) to the existing road network are needed to mitigate the future
traffic conditions following full development of the site as proposed.

The canopy Hotel brand is an emerging boutique hotel experience developed by Hilton
Hotels. This new and unique type of hotel experience is marketed towards the
millennial generation (those born between 1980 and the mid-2000s), however, is
relevant for the older generation of hotel guests. Each canopy Hotel is designed to
incorporate the essence of its local surroundings and neighborhood feel; such as offering
a local welcome gift and evening tastings of local food, beers, wines, and spirits to
providing local fitness and recreation options in terms of jogging and bicycle routes
(bicycles will be available for rent). The proposed canopy Ithaca by Hilton provides
approximately 123 guestrooms, a restaurant (2,000 SF), a small board room and meeting
room (1,000 SF), a fitness room, and a café/bar area. The proposed plan includes a
porte-cochère for guest drop-off and pick-up, valet service for guests, and a guest
parking zone along Seneca Way.

The proposed development site is located on the north side of M.L.K. Jr. Street, east of
North Aurora Street. The development site is bounded by Seneca Way to the northeast
and M.L.K. Jr. Street to the south. The site is currently a surface parking lot.

This report considers and evaluates the following transportation and operational
conditions:
  Existing traffic conditions during the weekday AM and PM peak hour intervals.
  Future background traffic conditions during the same peak intervals two years into
  the future considering general area growth patterns and nearby developments.
  Parking generation by hotel guests, visitors, and employees.
  New traffic generated by the proposed hotel.
  Distribution of site generated traffic.
  Development of future traffic conditions during the previously noted peak intervals,
  assuming the site fully built and operational.
  On-street parking conditions and on-site truck deliveries.
  Mutli-modal considerations.

The report that follows details the study procedures, analyses, and transportation
related recommendations associated with development of the proposed hotel.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the projected site generated traffic volumes and projected levels of service,
the proposed canopy Ithaca by Hilton in the City of Ithaca will not have a significant
adverse impact on existing traffic operations in the area, as documented in this report.
The analyses contained in this report indicate that the existing transportation network
can adequately accommodate the projected traffic volumes and resulting impacts to
study area intersections with the recommendations outlined. The following conclusions
and recommendations are based upon the results of the analyses:

     1. The proposed development is expected to generate approximately 34
        entering/24 exiting vehicles during the AM peak hour and 39 entering/36 exiting
        vehicles during the PM peak hour.

     2. Minor signal timing changes are needed at two study intersections:
               Aurora Street/M.L.K.Jr. Street
               East Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street

     3. With the recommended signal timing mitigation in place, the proposed project
        will not result in any potentially significant adverse traffic impacts to the study
        area intersections.

     4. Pedestrian walkways and connections to existing sidewalks are included.

     5. Bicycles for rent and bike racks are provided on site.

     6. The total demand for daily parking spaces required by hotel guests, visitors,
        employees, and the restaurant is expected to range from 69-125 spaces. The
        project developer indicates that approximately 60-70 parking spaces will be
        secured in the East Seneca Street Parking Garage on the top deck. Dedicated
        overflow parking is provided, when necessary. Valet parking is offered for hotel
        patrons enabling increased parking garage utilization. There are 11 parking spaces
        provided on-site. Three of the 11 spaces are signed for 15-minute parking. There
        is one ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) accessible parking space. In
        addition, opportunities for individuals to park off-site exist on-street and at other
        nearby parking garages.

     7. There are sufficient parking spaces available in the East Seneca Street Garage, as
        well as nearby parking garages, to accommodate the average daily hotel parking
        needs, as documented in a previous parking study by City Parking staff. In-door
        and out-door signage is recommended to direct hotel guests to the East Seneca
        Street Garage.

     8. An eight foot wide, 40 foot long curb lane for guest parking is proposed along
        Seneca Way. This existing curbside area can accommodate approximately two
        vehicles at a time and can be used for temporary loading/deliveries and guest
        check-in.

     9. Truck deliveries are planned on-site during off-peak hours.

I. INTRODUCTION

The primary purpose of this report is to identify and evaluate the potential traffic
impacts associated with the proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton in the
City of Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York. In addition, pedestrian, bicycle and transit
conditions, considerations and improvements are identified

In an effort to define traffic impact, this report identifies existing traffic conditions,
future background traffic conditions including area growth, and determines the future
traffic operations that result from the proposed development. Future traffic volumes
and operating conditions are evaluated. Parking generation and demand associated with
the proposed hotel is evaluated. In addition, an assessment of the on-street loading
conditions with the proposed hotel in operation is provided.


II. LOCATION

The proposed development site is located on the north side of M.L.K. Jr. Street, east of
North Aurora Street, in the City of Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York. The specified
parcel of land is bounded by Seneca Way to the north and east, and M.L.K. Jr. Street to
the south. The site is currently a surface parking lot. The site location and study area are
illustrated in Figure 1 - Site Location & Study Area (all figures are included at the end
of this report).


III. EXISTING HIGHWAY SYSTEM

The highway network within the study area is comprised of State arterials, City
collectors and local streets. Operation of the highway network within the study area is
based largely upon two one-way pair systems. East/West Green Street and East/West
Seneca Street (also known as NYS Route 79) complement each other to create the
east-west one-way pair system. East/West Green Street is one-way eastbound between
Fulton Street and East State Street; East/West Seneca Street is one-way westbound
between East State and North Meadow Street. NYS Route 79 (Green and Seneca
Streets), the major east-west corridor through the City, is functionally classified as an
urban minor arterial highway. In addition to carrying traffic through the City, theses
arterials serve properties and businesses through the Central Business District (CBD)
and border the Ithaca Commons on the north and south.

The other one-way pair is comprised of North/South Aurora Street northbound
between Court and State Streets and North/South Cayuga Street southbound between
Seneca Street and Green Street. Cayuga Street is a two-way roadway between Seneca
Street and Court Street. Both roadways are under the jurisdiction of the City of Ithaca.
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on North Aurora Street was approximately 5,764
vehicles per day (vpd) in 2011, according to the most recent data collected by the New
York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The AADT along Cayuga Street


                                                 1                             January 2015
Traffic Impact Study              Proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton   City of Ithaca, New York




was approximately 8,492 vpd in 2009 according to the most recent data collected by the
NYSDOT.

State Street between North/South Aurora Street and Seneca Way West is a two-lane
roadway with motorists travelling in an east/west direction. The AADT on State Street
was approximately 7,702 vpd in 2010, according to the most recent data collected by
the NYSDOT. On-street metered parking exists on both sides of the roadway between
North/South Aurora Street and Seneca Way.

Tioga Street is functionally classified as an urban collector roadway, under the
jurisdiction of the City of Ithaca in the study area. The highway is oriented in an
north/south direction and consists of two travel lanes in each direction. The AADT on
Tioga Street was approximately 1,859 vpd in 2011, according to the most recent data
collected by the NYSDOT.


IV. EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

        A. Peak Intervals for Analysis
              Given the functional characteristics of the roadways within the study area and
              the land use proposed for the site (boutique hotel), the peak hours selected
              for analysis are the weekday AM and PM peaks. The combination of site
              generated traffic and adjacent through traffic produces the greatest demand
              during these peak periods.

        B. Existing Traffic Volume Data
              Vehicular and pedestrian traffic counts were obtained on Wednesday, October
              1, 2014 (all study area intersections, except for Tioga Street) and recorded
              Thursday, December 4, 2014 at the Tioga Street/East Seneca Street
              intersection. Study intersections are as follows:

                1.     State Street (M.L.K. Jr. Street)/Seneca Way West
                2.     State Street/Green Street
                3.     State Street/S. Aurora Street
                4.     East Seneca Street/North Aurora Street
                5.     East Seneca Street/Tioga Street
                6.     Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street
                7.     Green Street/South Cayuga Street

              Traffic counts were conducted between 7:00-9:00 AM for the weekday
              morning peak hour and between 4:00-6:00 PM for the weekday evening peak
              hour. The collective data indicates that during these periods, the peak hours of
              traffic at the study intersections are generally 8:00-9:00 AM and 4:30-5:30 PM.
              All count data was collected on typical weekdays while local colleges,
              universities, and public schools were in session. All traffic volumes were


                                                        2                             January 2015
Traffic Impact Study           Proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton   City of Ithaca, New York




              reviewed to confirm accuracy and relative balance of the collective traffic
              counts. During the October traffic counts, a detour route was in place due to
              roadway work being performed along Clinton Street impacting the traffic
              volumes interacting with the study area intersections. In order to adjust for the
              effects of the detour, historical (2006 to 2011) traffic volumes at the study area
              intersections were reviewed to determine the likely changes resulting from the
              detour. Based upon our firms extensive traffic count database for downtown
              Ithaca intersections, and the Tioga Street/East Seneca Street turning movement
              count with no detour route in place, the 2014 existing traffic volumes were
              derived. The final and adjusted existing weekday AM and PM peak hour
              volumes are reflected in Figure 3.

        C. Field Observations
              The study intersections were observed during all three peak intervals to assess
              current traffic operations. Signal timing information was collected to determine
              peak hour phasing plans and phase durations during each interval.


V. FUTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL GROWTH

The proposed canopy Ithaca by Hilton will be constructed and operational by November
2016. The City of Ithaca was contacted to discuss any other specific developments that
are currently approved or under construction that would generate additional traffic in
the study area. Based upon the projects noted in the City’s 2014 projects map available
on the City’s website and historical traffic volumes in the CBD area, a 1% per year
growth rate has been applied to existing traffic volumes at the study area intersections
for the two-year build-out period. Future background traffic volumes are shown in
Figure 4.


VI. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

           A. Description
              The canopy Hotel brand is an emerging boutique hotel experience developed
              by Hilton Hotels. This new type of hotel experience is marketed towards the
              millennial generation (those born between 1980 and the mid-2000s),
              however, is relevant for the older generation of hotel guests. Each canopy
              Hotel is designed to incorporate the essence of its local surroundings and
              neighborhood feel; such as offering a local welcome gift and evening tastings
              of local food, beers, wines, and spirits to providing local fitness and
              recreation options in terms of jogging and bicycle routes (bicycles will be
              available for rent). The proposed canopy Ithaca by Hilton provides
              approximately 123 guestrooms, an upscale casual restaurant (2,000 SF), a
              small board room and meeting room (1,000 SF), a fitness room, and a
              café/bar area. A porte-cochère for guest drop-off and pick-up, valet service
              for guests, and a guest parking zone along Seneca Way are proposed. Figure

                                                     3                             January 2015
Traffic Impact Study             Proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton   City of Ithaca, New York




                5 illustrates the proposed concept site plan. Figure 6 shows the intended
                valet routes between the East Seneca Street Parking Garage and the
                proposed hotel. Variations in the temporal traffic conditions may dictate the
                valet take an alternative route, however, the graphic illustrates the most
                likely routes between the garage and proposed site.

           B. Site Traffic and Parking Generation
                Traffic Generation
                The volume of traffic generated by a site is dependent on the intended land
                use and size of the development. Trip generation is an estimate of the
                number of trips generated by a specific building or land use. These trips
                represent the volume of traffic entering and exiting the development. The
                Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition
                manual is used as a reference for this information. The trip rate for the peak
                hour of the generator may or may not coincide in time or volume with the
                trip rate for the peak hour of adjacent street traffic. Volumes generated
                during the peak hour of adjacent street traffic, in this case, the weekday AM
                and PM peaks, represent a more critical volume when analyzing the capacity
                of the system; those intervals will provide the basis of this analysis.

                The volume of site-generated traffic entering and exiting the proposed site
                has been estimated based on data contained in the Trip Generation manual.
                The ITE Trip Generation land use code (Hotel – using 70% average
                occupancy) was used to generate traffic for the proposed site. ITE defines
                hotels as “…places of lodging that provide sleeping accommodations and
                supporting facilities such as restaurants; cocktail lounges; meeting and
                banquet rooms or convention facilities; limited recreation facilities (pool,
                fitness room); and/or other retail and service shops.” All trip generation
                calculations are included in the Appendix of this report. Table I shows the
                total site generated trips for the weekday AM and weekday PM peak hours
                for the proposed canopy Ithaca by Hilton.

                It is noted that the projected trip generation may overestimate the actual
                trips that are likely to be generated by the canopy Ithaca by Hilton. This is
                primarily due to the central downtown location of the hotel and its
                proximity to the multitude of amenities provided in the immediate area (e.g.,


                                                       4                             January 2015

                The Commons). In addition, transit service is both conveniently located and
                adequate service to desirable destinations is provided in a timely manner.
                Further, this brand of hotel offers guests the ability to check-in without
                visiting the front desk, and receive pertinent information using their smart
                phones, potentially reducing the number of vehicles entering the site
                driveway. Therefore, vehicular traffic demand is likely to be reduced in favor
                of transit, pedestrian trips, and smart technologies.

                Parking Generation
                Parking generation rates published by ITE in the 3rd Edition of Parking
                Generation indicate that full service hotels have an average parking demand
                of 0.91 vehicles per hotel room and a peak (85th percentile) parking demand
                of 1.14 vehicles per hotel room. ITE Trip Generation and Parking Generation
                data, and data contained in Shared Parking Second Edition published by the
                Urban Land Institute also indicate that hotel rooms are 70% occupied on
                average. A modal split of 60%-70% auto usage and 30%-40% other modes
                (e.g. taxis, transit, shuttle service) is anticipated. Therefore, the proposed
                canopy Ithaca by Hilton is expected to require between 47 and 59 parking
                spaces on an average day for hotel guests.

                In addition to ITE published rates, this study also reviews potential parking
                demand using industry collected data. Hotel parkers are typically segmented
                by guests, visitors, and employees. The most common group requiring the
                most parking demand is guests. Based on discussions with the project
                developer, approximately 60% of guests will arrive by personal vehicles (the
                rest arrive by taxi, shuttle, transit, etc.). Using the previously discussed 70%
                occupancy rate (i.e. 86 rooms occupied out of 123 total), as well as using the
                60% drive-in rate, there is a demand for 52 parking spaces. However, in
                urbanized areas like Ithaca, drive-in rates are as low as 20%. Therefore, using
                this urbanized average (and 70% occupancy rate), there is a demand for 17
                parking spaces.

                The next group is visitors to the hotel classified as those individuals travelling
                to the hotel for business or group meetings. It is estimated that 25-50 can be
                accommodated between the board and meeting rooms. Industry standards
                indicate a drive-in rate of 35%, and therefore result in a demand for nine to
                18 parking spaces, depending on group size.

                Lastly, discussions with the project developer indicate that the hotel will
                employ 35-45 employees, depending the season, on a daily basis. In urbanized
                areas, drive-in rates for employees are approximately 50% (reduced due to
                transit, taxi, walking, bicycling, etc). Therefore, there is a demand of 18-23
                parking spaces for the hotel employees.

                The ULI indicates for a 2,000 SF Fine/Casual Dining Restaurant that
                approximately 31 parking spaces are required for visitors (15.4 vehicles per
                1,000 SF), while there is a demand for six spaces for employees (2.75 vehicles

                                                      5                             January 2015
Traffic Impact Study                 Proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton          City of Ithaca, New York




                per 1,000 SF). Given the proximity of the project site to nearby high density
                neighborhoods, the walkable nature of the city, and hotel guests already
                staying on-site, parking ratios may be reduced. Using an employee drive-in
                ratio of 50% (from the hotel) and a conservative patron drive-in ratio of 70%,
                there is a demand for approximately 25 parking spaces. As well, the peak
                parking demand hour for this type of restaurant occurs after the typical
                weekday commuter peak hour during the PM peak. The availability of parking
                spaces in the downtown central business district, (CBD) will likely be greater
                as a result of departing worker traffic, thus contributing to shared parking
                tendencies between the proposed hotel uses and existing nearby
                employment-based land uses (each use has varying demand patterns
                depending on the time of day).

                Therefore, the total average demand for daily parking spaces required by
                hotel guests, visitors, employees, and the restaurant is expected to range
                from 69-125 spaces. The project developer indicated that approximately 60-
                70 parking spaces will be secured in the East Seneca Street Parking Garage
                on the top deck. Dedicated overflow parking is provided, when necessary.
                Based on a review of the amount of parking spaces on the top deck of the
                East Seneca Street Garage, there are approximately 90 parking spaces. There
                are 451 total parking spaces within the garage with an average daytime
                occupancy rate of 60% (210 spaces) as documented previously by city parking
                staff. Additionally, the parking survey conducted by the city of parking
                availability during the evening with the proposed hotel in operation (assuming
                100% occupancy with one vehicle per room which does not factor in
                visitors, employees, or restaurant patrons) results in a total garage
                occupancy rate (includes parking for from other users) of 77% (273 spaces).

                Table II depicts the total hotel vehicle volume for parking space demand.
                The table segments the hotel parkers, and illustrates the average and peak
                parking demand requirements.

                The peak demand for parking indicates a required 149 parking spaces. Valet
                parking will be offered for hotel patrons enabling increased utilization of less
                convenient, unused parking spaces. There are 11 parking spaces provided on-
                site. Three of the 11 spaces are signed for 15-minute parking. There is one
                ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) accessible parking space. In addition,
                there are opportunities for individuals to park off-site and at nearby parking
                garages. Using the East Seneca Street Parking Garage and other available
                parking locations throughout the downtown CBD, there are sufficient
                parking spaces available to accommodate the average daily, and peak, hotel
                parking needs.

           C. Site Traffic Distribution
                The cumulative effect of site traffic on the transportation network is
                dependent on the origins and destinations of that traffic and the location of
                the access drives serving the site.

                The proposed arrival/departure distribution of traffic to be generated at this
                site is considered a function of several parameters, including the following:
                         Colleges and Universities in the area;
                         Existing highway network (considering the one-way street system);
                         Existing traffic conditions and controls;
                         East Seneca Street Parking Garage access drive location;
                         Proposed driveway location

                Figure 7 shows the anticipated trip distribution pattern percentages for the
                proposed development and Figure 8 illustrates the peak hour site generated
                traffic based on those percentages for the weekday AM and PM peak hour
                periods. It should be noted that the report analyses the arrival traffic as
                entering the proposed development’s driveway and departing traffic as
                exiting the proposed hotel and travelling to the East Seneca Street Garage.
                There may likely be guests who check-in at the hotel using the on-street
                loading spaces along Seneca Way, as well as departing patrons who may not
                travel to the parking garage. However, for conservative purposes, all traffic is
                projected to use the site’s proposed driveway along M.L.K. Jr. Street.


VII. FULL DEVELOPMENT VOLUMES
Proposed design hour traffic volumes are developed for each peak by combining the
background traffic conditions (Figure 4) and the newly created traffic generations (Figure
8). The resulting network design hour volumes, based on the development as proposed,
are illustrated in Figure 9.

VIII. CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Capacity analysis is a technique used for determining a measure of effectiveness for a
section of roadway and/or intersection based on the number of vehicles during a specific
time period. The measure of effectiveness used for the capacity analysis is referred to as
a Level of Service (LOS). Levels of Service are calculated to provide an indication of the
amount of delay that a motorist experiences while traveling along a roadway or through
an intersection. Since the most amount of delay to motorists usually occurs at
intersections, the capacity analysis specifically focuses on intersections.

Six Levels of Service are defined for analysis purposes. They are assigned letter
designations, from "A" to "F", with LOS "A" representing the best conditions and LOS
"F" the worst. Suggested ranges of service capacity and an explanation of Levels of
Service are included in the Appendix.

The standard procedure for capacity analysis of signalized and unsignalized intersections
is outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) published by the
Transportation Research Board. Traffic analysis software, Synchro 7, which is based on
procedures and methodologies contained in the HCM, was used to analyze operating
conditions at study area intersections. The procedure yields a Level of Service (LOS)
based on the HCM 2010 as an indicator of how well intersections operate.

Existing operating conditions during the peak study periods are evaluated to determine
a basis for comparison with the projected future conditions. The future traffic
conditions generated by the development were analyzed to assess the operations of the
intersections in the study area. Capacity results for existing, background, and full
development are listed in Table III. The discussion following the table summarizes
capacity conditions. All capacity analysis calculations are included in the Appendix.

other adjustments are needed at the other study area intersections.

M.L.K. Jr. Street/Green Street
The results show that this intersection operates at overall level of service “B” and “A”
during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively, under all conditions. No change in level
of service is expected as a result of the proposed development. As such, no mitigation is
warranted or recommended at this intersection.

M.L.K. Jr. Street/Seneca Way West
The results show that this intersection operates at overall level of service “C” during
both the AM and PM peak hours under all conditions. No change in level of service is
projected as a result of the proposed development. As such, no mitigation is
recommended at this intersection as a result of this development.

M.L.K. Jr. Street/Proposed Driveway
All approaches are projected to operate at level of service “B” or better during both
peak hours under full development conditions. Observations throughout the corridor at
the time of data collection showed vehicle queues extending beyond the driveway
entrance through the Seneca Way West and Green Street intersections. It should be
noted that the intersection of M.L.K. Jr. Street/Aurora Street was operating as an all-
way stop at the time of data collection due to the replacement of the traffic signal. Valet
services should be encouraged to exit the hotel to the west and use the M.L.K. Jr.
Street/Aurora Street intersection to travel to the secured parking garage. However,
depending on the traffic conditions along, motorists may choose to exit the site to the
east and travel along Seneca Way to enter the parking garage. No other mitigation is
recommended at this intersection as a result of this development.

M.L.K. Jr. Street/Aurora Street
The overall level of service operates at “C” during the AM peak hour and “D” during
the PM peak hour under all conditions. Increasing the green time given to westbound
motorists between background and full development conditions during the PM peak
hour improves the westbound LOS from “E” to “D”. Although the northbound
operating condition changes from LOS “B” to “C”, between background and full
development conditions, the overall delay during the PM peak hour improves from 48.4
seconds to 36.4 seconds.

East Seneca Street/North Aurora Street
The northbound approach is expected to change in level of service from “A” to “B”
during the PM peak hour between background and full development conditions. No
other change in LOS is projected as a result of the proposed development. All
approaches operate at LOS “C” or better during both peak hours under all conditions.
No mitigation is warranted or recommended.

East Seneca Street/Tioga Street
The overall level of service operates at “A” and “B” during the AM and PM peak hours,
respectively, under all conditions. No change in LOS is projected as a result of the
proposed development. As such, no mitigation is warranted or recommended.

East Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street
The overall intersection level of service operates at “C” during the AM and PM peak
hours under all conditions. With minor signal timing adjustments as mitigation, no
change in LOS is projected during both peak hours as a result of the proposed
development. Signal timing adjustments to increase the green time given to southbound
motorists during the AM and PM peak hours improves the LOS from “E” to “D” during
the AM peak hour and “F” to “E” during the PM peak hour.

Green Street/North Cayuga Street
The overall level of service operates at “C” during the AM and PM peak hours under all
conditions. All approaches operate at LOS “D” or better during both peak hours under
all conditions. No mitigation is warranted or recommended.


IX. PROPOSED ON-STREET LOADING AREA

An eight foot wide, 40 foot long curb lane for guest parking is proposed along Seneca
Way. This existing curbside area can accommodate approximately two vehicles at a time
and can be used for temporary loading/deliveries and guest check-in. Signage inside and
outside the hotel is recommended to direct hotel guests to the East Seneca Street
Garage to lessen the demand along Seneca Way. Additionally, guests who travel to the
hotel via personal automobile can be directed to the parking garage prior to arriving
through the smart phone app for the hotel.


X. PROPOSED TRUCK DELIVERIES

Truck deliveries are anticipated on-site and will likely be made during early morning
(before 7 AM) and early afternoon hours via the proposed driveway along M.L.K. Jr.
Street. Therefore deliveries will not impact the peak commuter travel periods.


XI. MULTI-MODAL CONSIDERATIONS

Pedestrian Facilities
The City of Ithaca is noted for high levels of walking for daily transport. According to
the 2012 U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates for
transportation mode share, approximately 42% of residents walk to work. This figure is
buoyed by the proximity of Cornell University to the CBD; however, the higher density
of the city allows for more non-motorized transport between residential
neighborhoods, and places of work and play. Sidewalks are present throughout the CBD
and adjacent to the proposed hotel. Pedestrian crosswalks and countdown signals are

                                               11                             January 2015
Traffic Impact Study       Proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton   City of Ithaca, New York




present at signalized intersections. The width of the sidewalks varies between five feet
(along Seneca Way) and eight feet (along M.L.K. Jr. Street) around the block on which
the proposed hotel is located.

The site is designed for transparency between the public realm and interior hotel uses,
specifically along Seneca Way. A pedestrian walkway connects the sidewalk along M.L.K.
Jr. Street to the entrance of the hotel and continues around the east side of the building
to provide a continuous link to Seneca Way. A pedestrian entrance is provided along
Seneca Way. Moreover, the proposed canopy Ithaca by Hilton is located less than 300
feet from The Commons. Hotel guests will also be given information on recommended
jogging routes throughout the city.

Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle storage racks are located throughout the city. The city is expanding its bicycle
infrastructure in terms of on-street bicycle lanes, shared lane markings (“sharrows”),
and a proposed bicycle boulevard along Plain Street between Elmira Road to Cascadilla
Street. As was previously stated, the proposed hotel will offer bicycles for rent to its
guests and provide maps to guide visitors to nearby destinations. A bicycle storage rack
is located along M.L.K. Jr. Street.

Transit Facilities
Transit is an important mobility option for those travelling to/from destinations such as
Cornell University and the Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport. Tompkins Consolidated
Area Transit (TCAT) has 33 bus routes, operates 22 hours a day, and services an area-
wide population of over 100,000. Ridership has grown every year since 2006 and
accounts for over 10% of daily commuter trips (ACS, 2012). Specifically to the proposed
site, there are six transit stops located within a ¼-mile (five-minute walk) to the site.


XII. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the projected site generated traffic volumes and projected levels of service,
the proposed canopy Ithaca by Hilton in the City of Ithaca will not have a significant
adverse impact on existing traffic operations in the area, as documented in this report.
The analyses contained in this report indicate that the existing transportation network
can adequately accommodate the projected traffic volumes and resulting impacts to
study area intersections with the recommendations outlined. The following conclusions
and recommendations are based upon the results of the analyses:

     1. The proposed development is expected to generate approximately 34
        entering/24 exiting vehicles during the AM peak hour and 39 entering/36 exiting
        vehicles during the PM peak hour.

     2. Minor signal timing changes are needed at two study intersections:
               Aurora Street/M.L.K.Jr. Street
               East Seneca Street/North Cayuga Street


                                                12                             January 2015
Traffic Impact Study        Proposed canopy Ithaca | The Commons by Hilton   City of Ithaca, New York




     3. With the recommended signal timing mitigation in place, the proposed project
        will not result in any potentially significant adverse traffic impacts to the study
        area intersections.

     4. Pedestrian walkways and connections to existing sidewalks are included.

     5. Bicycles for rent and bike racks are provided on site.

     6. The total demand for daily parking spaces required by hotel guests, visitors,
        employees, and the restaurant is expected to range from 69-125 spaces. The
        project developer indicates that approximately 60-70 parking spaces will be
        secured in the East Seneca Street Parking Garage on the top deck. Dedicated
        overflow parking is provided, when necessary. Valet parking is offered for hotel
        patrons enabling increased parking garage utilization. There are 11 parking spaces
        provided on-site. Three of the 11 spaces are signed for 15-minute parking. There
        is one ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) accessible parking space. In
        addition, opportunities for individuals to park off-site exist on-street and at other
        nearby parking garages.

     7. There are sufficient parking spaces available in the East Seneca Street Garage, as
        well as nearby parking garages, to accommodate the average daily hotel parking
        needs, as documented in a previous parking study by City Parking staff. In-door
        and out-door signage is recommended to direct hotel guests to the East Seneca
        Street Garage.

     8. An eight foot wide, 40 foot long curb lane for guest parking is proposed along
        Seneca Way. This existing curbside area can accommodate approximately two
        vehicles at a time and can be used for temporary loading/deliveries and guest
        check-in.

     9. Truck deliveries are planned on-site during off-peak hours.

Criteria and Definitions
            Level of Service Criteria
              Highway Capacity Manual 2010
SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Level of Service is a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic
stream, based on service measures such as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic
interruptions, comfort, and convenience. Level of Service for signalized intersections is defined
in terms of delay specifically, average total delay per vehicle for a 15 minute analysis period. The
ranges are as follows:


                                     Level     Control Delay
                                      of        per vehicle
                                    Service      (seconds)
                                      A             < 10
                                       B          10 – 20
                                      C           20 – 35
                                      D           35 – 55
                                       E          55 – 80
                                       F            >80


UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Level of Service for unsignalized intersections is also defined in terms of delay. However, the
delay criteria are different from a signalized intersection. The primary reason for this is driver
expectation that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. The total delay threshold for any given Level of Service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. The ranges are as follows:


                                     Level     Control Delay
                                      of        per vehicle
                                    Service      (seconds)
                                      A             < 10
                                       B          10 – 15
                                      C           15 – 25
                                      D           25 – 35
                                       E          35 - 50
                                       F            >50

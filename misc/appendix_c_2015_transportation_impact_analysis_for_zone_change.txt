Subject:      Transportation Impact Analysis for the Proposed Zone Change and Comprehensive Plan
              Amendment


Providence Health & Services (herein referred to as “Providence”) is proposing a Master Plan Boundary
Change for its Willamette Falls Medical Center. At the same time, they are proposing a Comprehensive
Plan Amendment and Zone Change for two of the properties within the boundary. These parcels are
located to the west of Division Street between 15th Street and 16th Street, and total 22,500 square feet
in size. The change in zoning of these properties will enable the provision of off-street parking to
support the medical office building contemplated as part of Phase 3 of the Master Plan on the adjacent
property. The property in which the medical office building would be constructed is already contained
within the existing Master Plan boundary and is zoned appropriately for its use.

Today, these subject parcels are zoned R-6 – Single Family Dwelling District. Providence would like to
rezone these parcels to MUE – Mixed Use Employment District. Title 17 of Oregon City’s Municipal
Code identifies the permitted uses and dimensional standards allowed under each zoning designation.
Per Chapter 17.12, R-6 zoning enables the development of single family homes with a minimum lot size
of 6,000 square feet. With these provisions, a reasonable worse case development under the R-6
zoning would enable three single family homes to be developed (assuming 22,500 square feet of
property and minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet).

Per Chapter 17.31, MUE allows for a variety of office uses, including hospital and medical office
building. The minimum floor area ratio is 0.25, which would enable an approximately 6,000 square foot
office building. As noted above, Providence would like to use these properties to supply off-street
parking for a future medical office building adjacent to Division Street but not for an actual building.
However, for the purposes of addressing Oregon’s Transportation Planning Rule (TPR), as defined in
Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 660-012-0060, a traffic analysis is required to demonstrate whether
the zone change could result in a significant impact on the transportation system. This memorandum
presents the results of the TPR analysis.

The results of this study indicate that the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan Amendment
are consistent with the requirements of the TPR and applicable Oregon City transportation-related
approval criteria. No mitigation measures or changes to the transportation standards are needed to
support the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan amendment.

Additional details of the study methodology and findings are provided within this report.


SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This report presents the transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed zone change and
Comprehensive Plan Amendment and was prepared in accordance with Oregon City’s requirements for
a traffic impact study and the TPR (OAR 660-012-0060).

The study intersection and scope of work for this project were developed in coordination with City
staff. As part of the study, operational analyses were performed at the intersection of 15 th Street and
Division Street.

This report evaluates the following transportation scenarios:

                Year 2015 existing traffic conditions at the study intersection during the weekday AM and
                 PM peak periods;
                Year 2035 existing zoning traffic conditions at the study intersection during the weekday
                 AM and PM peak periods; and,
                Year 2035 proposed zoning traffic conditions at the study intersection during the weekday
                 AM and PM peak periods.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and the current physical and operational
characteristics of the transportation facilities and services within the study area. These conditions will
be compared with future conditions later in this report.


SITE CONDITIONS AND ADJACENT LAND USES
The parcels that comprise the site are located to the west of Division Street between 15 th Street and
16th Street and are a total 22,500 square feet in size. The site is currently occupied by two single-family
residential homes. Adjacent land uses include a mix of residential and medical uses. Figure 1 illustrates
the site vicinity.

Figure 2 illustrates the existing lane configurations and traffic control devices at the study intersection.

Pedestrian Facilities
Sidewalks are present on both sides of 15th and 16th Streets and are partially complete on Division
Street. If the property is redeveloped in the future, sidewalks will be provided along all site frontages
consistent with Oregon City street design standards.

Bicycle Facilities
There are no on-street bicycle facilities within the study area. Future site frontage improvements will
include bike lanes along 15th Street and Division Street, consistent with Oregon City street design
standards.

Transit Facilities
Trimet operates Route 32 – Oatfield on Division Street and 16th Street. During the weekday AM and PM
peak periods, Bus 32 provides service between Clackamas Community College and Portland City Center.
Outside of the weekday AM and PM peak periods, the route runs from Milwaukie City Center to
Clackamas Community College. Weekday service runs from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Saturday service runs
between Oregon City Transit Center and Clackamas Community College hourly between 10:00 AM and
5:00 PM. Service is not provided on Sundays. The nearest bus stops are located at the 15th
Street/Division Street intersection for southbound buses on Division Street and at the 14th
Street/Division Street intersection for northbound buses.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
Manual turning movement counts were conducted at the study intersection in June 2015 on a mid-
week day. Figure 2 provides a summary of the measured year 2015 traffic volumes. Attachment “A”
contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.

July 23, 2015                                                                                             Page 6


Current Levels of Service
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual. A description of level of service and the criteria by which
it is determined is presented in Attachment “B”. Attachment “B” also indicates how level of service
(LOS) is measured and what is generally considered an acceptable range.

Per Oregon City’s Transportation System Plan, the applicable mobility standard for unsignalized
intersection operations during the peak hour is:

“All movements serving more than 20 vehicles shall be maintained at LOS “E” or better. LOS “F” will be
tolerated at movements serving no more than 20 vehicles during the peak hour.”

All intersection level-of-service evaluations used the traffic volumes from the AM and PM peak hours,
adjusted with a peak hour factor so that the analysis reflects a reasonable worst-case scenario. For this
reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to occur for 15 minutes out of each average
peak hour. The transportation system will likely operate under conditions better than those described
in this report during all other time periods.

Figure 2 summarizes the level-of-service analysis results for the study intersection under existing traffic
conditions. As shown, the study intersection currently meets the City’s LOS “E” standard during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours. Attachment “C” includes the existing traffic conditions level-of-service
analysis worksheets.


TRANSPORTATION PLANNING RULE ANALYSIS
Per Oregon Administrative Rule 660-012-0060, also known as the Transportation Planning Rule (TPR), a
zone change and Comprehensive Plan amendment must not create an unmitigated significant effect on
an existing or planned transportation system. If a significant effect is expected to occur, it must be
mitigated within the planning horizon. The City of Oregon City Transportation System Plan (TSP)
planning horizon is year 2035. Therefore, in order to determine if there is a significant effect, the
following analyses were conducted:

                Year 2035 existing zoning traffic conditions (assuming development of the property under
                 the existing zoning and comprehensive plan designations) at the study intersection during
                 the weekday AM and PM peak periods; and,
                Year 2035 proposed zoning traffic conditions (assuming a reasonable worst case
                 development scenario under the proposed zoning and comprehensive plan designations) at
                 the study intersection during the weekday AM and PM peak periods.

LAND USE SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT
As indicated previously, these subject parcels are currently zoned R-6 – Single Family Dwelling District.
Providence would like to rezone these parcels to MUE – Mixed Use Employment District.


Existing Zoning and Comprehensive Plan Designation
Title 17 of Oregon City’s Municipal Code identifies the permitted uses and dimensional standards
allowed under each zoning designation. Per Chapter 17.12, R-6 zoning enables the development of
single family homes with a minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet. With these provisions, a reasonable
worse case development under the R-6 zoning would enable three single family homes to be developed
(assuming 22,500 square feet of property and minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet).


Proposed Zoning and Comprehensive Plan Designation
The proposed MUE zoning allows for a variety of office uses, including hospital and medical office
building. The minimum floor area ratio is 0.25, which would enable an approximately 6,000 square foot
office building. As noted above, Providence would like to use these properties to supply off-street
parking for a future medical office building adjacent to Division Street but not for an actual building.
However, for the purposes of addressing the TPR, a traffic analysis is required to demonstrate whether
buildout of the property consistent with the proposed zoning would result in a significant effect on the
transportation system.


Trip Generation
A trip generation estimate was prepared for the existing and proposed designations based on
information provided in the standard reference manual, Trip Generation, 9th Edition, published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers. ITE land use code 210 (Single Family Homes) was used to reflect
the existing R-6 designation while ITE land use code 720 (Medical Office Building) was used to reflect
the proposed MUE designation. Table 2 summarizes the daily, weekday AM, and weekday PM peak
hour trips associated with both designations.

YEAR 2035 EXISTING ZONING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The existing zoning analysis forecasts how the study area’s transportation system will operate in 2035
assuming development of the property consistent with the residential zoning and comprehensive plan
designations.


Traffic Volumes
The year 2035 traffic volumes were developed by applying a growth rate of 0.5% per year to existing
traffic volumes and adding the number of additional trips expected from the approved Master Plan for
Providence Willamette Falls Medical Center. In addition, the residential trips shown in Table 2 were
added to account for the buildout of the site under the existing zoning.

Given the site fronts on 16th Street and applying a distribution of 30 percent to the south and 70
percent to the northeast/northwest, only 30 percent of the potential site trips would travel through the
15th Street/Division Street intersection under either zoning scenario.

Intersection Operations
As shown in Figure 3, the study intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably under the
existing zoning scenario. Attachment “D” includes the horizon year 2035 existing zoning traffic
conditions level-of-service analysis worksheets.

YEAR 2035 PROPOSED ZONING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The proposed zoning analysis forecasts how the study intersection will operate assuming a reasonable
worst case development under the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan Amendment. The
medical office building trips shown in Table 2 were distributed onto the study area roadway system
based on forecast travel patterns identified in the Providence Willamette Falls Medical Center Master
Plan.

Figure 3 illustrates the future traffic conditions under both the existing and proposed zoning. It
illustrates the trip distribution pattern along with the assignment of the proposed zoning trips at the
study intersection. The horizon year 2035 existing zoning traffic volumes were added to the net new
trips shown to arrive at the year 2035 proposed zoning traffic volumes.


Intersection Operations
As shown in Figure 3, the study intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably assuming the
buildout of the property consistent with the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan
amendment. As such, the proposed amendments do not create a significant effect on the
transportation system as defined by the TPR. Attachment “E” includes the year 2035 proposed zoning
traffic conditions level-of-service analysis worksheets.

POLICY REVIEW
Approval of the Comprehensive Plan Amendment is dependent on meeting the criteria outlined in the
Transportation Planning Rule (TPR). Table 3 summarizes the criteria identified in the TPR and their
applicability to the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan Amendment.

As noted in Table 3, there is one criterion that applies to the proposed zone change and Comprehensive
Plan Amendment. The criterion is provided below in italics with our response shown in standard font.

     (1) If an amendment to a functional plan, an acknowledged comprehensive plan, or a land use regulation (including
     a zoning map) would significantly affect an existing or planned transportation facility, then the local government
     must put in place measures as provided in section (2) of this rule, unless the amendment is allowed under section
     (3), (9) or (10) of this rule. A plan or land use regulation amendment significantly affects a transportation facility if
     it would:

           (a) Change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility (exclusive of correction
           of map errors in an adopted plan);

           (b) Change standards implementing a functional classification system; or

           (c) Result in any of the effects listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this subsection based on projected
           conditions measured at the end of the planning period identified in the adopted TSP. As part of evaluating
           projected conditions, the amount of traffic projected to be generated within the area of the amendment may
           be reduced if the amendment includes an enforceable, ongoing requirement that would demonstrably limit
           traffic generation, including, but not limited to, transportation demand management. This reduction may
           diminish or completely eliminate the significant effect of the amendment.

                 (A) Types or levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the functional classification of an existing
                 or planned transportation facility;

                 (B) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility such that it would not meet
                 the performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive plan; or

                 (C) Degrade the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility that is otherwise projected
                 to not meet the performance standards identified in the TSP or comprehensive plan.

Response: Per the analysis described above, the study intersection is forecast to meet Oregon City’s
operational standards with and without the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan
Amendment during the weekday AM and PM peak hours, and therefore there is no significant effect.
Further, the proposed zone change is consistent with the existing functional classifications of the
adjacent street system and adopted standards; no changes to the standards are required as part of the
proposed amendments.


CONCLUSION
The results of this study indicate that the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan Amendment
are consistent with the requirements of the Transportation Planning Rule and applicable City standards.
The key findings of this analysis are summarized below.


FINDINGS
                The study intersection operates acceptably during the weekday AM and PM peak hours
                 under all scenarios analyzed.
                Buildout of the property consistent with the zoning designations could result in a net
                 increase of 188 daily trips, including 12 trips (10 inbound, 2 outbound) during the weekday
                 AM peak hour and 18 trips (4 inbound, 14 outbound) during the weekday PM peak hour.
                The proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan amendment is not anticipated to result
                 in a significant effect on the transportation system, as defined by Oregon’s Transportation
                 Planning Rule.
                No mitigation measures or changes to the transportation standards are needed to support
                 the proposed zone change and Comprehensive Plan amendment.

DESCRIPTION OF LEVEL-OF-SERVICE
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from “A” to “F”.1


Signalized Intersections
The six level-of-service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table B1.
Additionally, Table B2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per
vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service “D” is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

Table B1: Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

    Level of
    Service                                                              Average Delay per Vehicle
                     Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and most
       A
                     vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
                     Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally
       B             occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of
                     average delay.
                     Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher
       C             delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
                     The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
                     Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of
                     congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
       D
                     length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle
                     failures are noticeable.
                     Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually
       E             considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long
                     cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                     Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This condition
       F             often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures.
                     Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

Unsignalized Intersections
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service levels associated
with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B3. A quantitative definition of level of service
for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B4. Using this definition, Level of Service “E” is
generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

      F             Represents an intersection failure condition that is caused by geometric and/or operational constraints external to the
                     intersection.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is
that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on the
minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying

acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left-turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left-turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the HCM
level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This study has been conducted to address the potential traffic impacts associated with the
proposed Southgate development located at the southwest corner of the intersection of
Poplin Road (SR 1508) and N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) in Indian Trail, North
Carolina. The proposed residential development consists of 242 single-family units, 240
apartment units, 120 townhome units, and 170,000 sq. feet of retail. It is anticipated that
the proposed development will be completed by 2022. The study evaluates existing
traffic conditions as well as the traffic conditions that are likely to occur upon completion
of the proposed development. The following provides a brief summary of the study.

Existing Conditions
A field inventory was conducted to evaluate the existing transportation facilities located
within the study area. The following intersections were identified:

       •       Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at Secrest Shortcut Road (SR
               1501)
       •       Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at N Rocky River Road (SR
               1514)
       •       Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at Poplin Road (SR 1508)
       •       N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) at Poplin Road (SR 1508)
       •       N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) at Price Road (SR 1527)

Existing Traffic
In order to determine existing traffic demands and vehicular flow patterns, manual AM
and PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected between 7:00 – 9:00 AM and
4:00 – 6:00 PM for the following intersections:

       •       Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at Secrest Shortcut Road (SR
               1501)
       •       Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at N Rocky River Road (SR
               1514)
       •       Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at Poplin Road (SR 1508)
       •       N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) at Poplin Road (SR 1508)
       •       N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) at Price Road (SR 1527)

                                                                          DRMP#: 13-0177.000



Future Traffic
No-Build Conditions

Traffic growth on area roadways is a function of the planned/expected land development
within the study area and surrounding region. Even if the proposed development was not
constructed, traffic in the study area would continue to grow due to other land
development within the study area. The background analysis included existing traffic,
existing geometry, background growth, and approved development traffic. Background
growth represents the increase in traffic due to unspecified growth anticipated to occur
throughout the project study area. Based on discussions with NCDOT staff and approved
methodology, an increase of 2 percent per year was applied to the existing traffic to
calculate base background traffic volumes. Approved development traffic is the traffic
generated by approved developments within the area of influence. Proposed Bonterra
Village developments located on Faith Church Road is the only development that will
affect the study area intersections. These approved trips were obtained from the Bonterra
Village Traffic Impact Study (DRMP, Inc. June 2013).

Proposed Development

The proposed Southgate development will consist of 242 single-family units, 240
apartment units, 120 townhome units, and 170,000 sq. feet of retail. Two new access
roads on Poplin Road (SR 1508) and three new access roads on N Rocky River Road (SR
1514) will be included as part of the proposed Southgate development. For the purpose of
this study, full build-out of the proposed development is expected to occur by 2022.

Build Conditions

The number of vehicles (entering and exiting) from the proposed development was
estimated based on the guidelines and methodology published in the Institute of
Transportation Engineer’s (ITE’s) “Trip Generation” Eighth Edition and “Trip
Generation Handbook.” The estimated trips were assigned to the adjacent streets and
added to the 2022 No-Build traffic volumes.

Turn Lane Analysis
Based on the “NCDOT Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina
Highways” guidelines, turn lane warrant analyses were performed on Poplin Road and N
Rocky River Road at the proposed Southgate site entrances. Figure “Warrant for Left and
Right-Turn Lanes” at page 80 of the NCDOT Policy on Street and Driveway Access to
North Carolina Highways was used to evaluate the turn lanes.

The results of the analyses are attached in Appendix B. Based on the guidelines and
projected traffic volumes the following recommendations are suggested for the site
entrances on Poplin Road (SR 1508) and N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

                                                                        DRMP#: 13-0177.000


Access Road 1 (West Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

   •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
       feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
       minimum 50 feet of storage.

Access Road 2 (East Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

   •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
       feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
       minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 3 (North Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 4 (Mid Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   No separate southbound right-turn lane is warranted at this entrance.

Access Road 5 (South Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a minimum 50 feet of storage.

Traffic Operations Analysis
Capacity analyses resulting in Level of Service (LOS) assignments were performed for
the study area intersections as well as for the access road (site entrance).

The intersection of Unionville Indian Trail and Secrest Shortcut Road (SR 1501) is
currently operating at an overall LOS C and all the approaches to this intersection are
operating at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak periods. For the
Background or 2022 No Build Condition, this intersection is expected to operate at an
overall LOS D during both the AM and PM peak periods. With the proposed Southgate
development traffic, this intersection would continue to operate at an overall LOS D

                                                                                 Southgate TIS
                                                                            DRMP#: 13-0177.000


during both the AM and PM peak periods and all the approaches to this intersection are
expected to operate at LOS D or better. Thus, the proposed Southgate development is not
expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operation of this intersection. As
indicated in Table 4, overall as well as individual approach delay as a result of traffic
generated by the proposed development will not increase by 25% or more and therefore,
no improvements such as additional turn lanes were recommended at this intersection.

A review of the maximum queue and blocking report shows that the existing storage
lengths (125 feet) for all the left-turn lanes at this intersection would not be adequate to
accommodate the future 2022 traffic volumes even without the proposed Southgate
development. In order to accommodate 2022 future traffic volumes, a maximum 250 feet
storage is needed on Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) for the eastbound and the
westbound left-turn lanes, a maximum 250 feet storage is needed on Secrest Shortcut
Road (SR 1501) for the southbound and for the northbound left-turn lane. The developer
should not be responsible for the extension of the eastbound, the northbound and the
southbound left-turn lanes at this intersection.

The intersection of Unionville Indian Trail and N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) is
currently operating at an overall LOS B and all the approaches to this intersection are
operating at LOS B or better during both the AM and PM peak periods. For the
Background or 2022 No Build Condition, this intersection is expected to operate at an
overall LOS B during both the AM and PM peak periods. With the proposed Southgate
development traffic, this intersection would continue to operate at an overall acceptable
LOS B during both the AM and PM peak periods and all the approaches to this
intersection are expected to operate at LOS B. Thus, the proposed Southgate development
is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operation of this intersection.
As indicated in Table 6, overall as well as individual approach delay as a result of traffic
generated by the proposed development will not increase by 25% or more and therefore,
no improvements were recommended at this intersection.

At the intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Poplin Road (SR
1508), the southbound approach is expected to operate at LOS C during the AM peak and
LOS B during the PM peak period and the northbound approach is expected to operate at
LOS B during both the AM and PM peak periods. For the Background or No Build
condition, the southbound approach is expected to operate at LOS D during the AM peak
and LOS C during the PM peak period and the northbound approach is expected to
operate at LOS C during both the AM and PM peak periods. With the proposed
Southgate development, the southbound approach is expected to operate at LOS D during
the AM peak and LOS C during the PM peak period and the northbound approach is
expected to operate at LOS C during both the AM and PM peak periods. Thus, the
proposed Southgate development is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on
the operation of this intersection. As indicated in Table 7, approach delay as a result of
traffic generated by the proposed development will not increase by 25% or more and
therefore, no improvements were recommended at this intersection.

                                                                            DRMP#: 13-0177.000


At the intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Poplin Road (SR 1508), the
eastbound approach is currently operating at LOS E during the AM and LOS C during
the PM peak period. The westbound approach is operating at LOS B during both AM
and PM peak periods. For the Background or No Build condition, the eastbound approach
is expected to operate at LOS F during the AM peak and LOS C during the PM peak
period and the westbound approach is expected to operate at LOS B during both the AM
and PM peak periods. With the proposed Southgate development, the eastbound approach
is expected to operate at LOS F during both AM peak and PM peak periods. It is not
unusual for side street traffic to experience long delays at unsignalized intersections
during peak hours due to left turning vehicles, but is typically considered a short term
situation. The westbound approach is expected to operate at LOS C during the AM and
LOS D during the PM peak period with the proposed developments. It is anticipated that
the traffic generated by this proposed development would not fully meet the requirements
or warrants for a signal installation at this intersection and would not create any
significant adverse impacts on the through traffic on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514).
Therefore a traffic signal is not recommended. However, this intersection needs to be
monitored closely for possible future roundabout even without the proposed
developments.

At the intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Price Road (SR 1527), the
westbound approach is currently operating at LOS D during the AM and LOS B during
the PM peak period. For the Background or No Build condition, the northbound
approach is expected to operate at LOS F during the AM peak and LOS C during the PM
peak period. With the proposed Southgate development, the westbound approach is
expected to operate at LOS F during the AM peak and LOS E during the PM peak period.
The westbound approach is expected to operate at LOS F during the AM peak even
without the proposed Southgate development. This is due to AM peak hour school traffic
at this intersection. It is not unusual for side street traffic to experience long delays at
unsignalized intersections during peak hours due to left turning vehicles, but is typically
considered a short term situation. It is anticipated that the traffic generated by this
proposed development would not create any significant adverse impacts on the through
traffic on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514).

Proposed Access Road 1 (Site Entrance) is planned to be located on Poplin Road (SR
1508). This entrance was analyzed with an eastbound right-turn lane and a westbound
left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) (as determined by turn lane warrant analysis)
and separate left and right-turn lane on northbound (Access Road) approach. This
entrance with all the specific lane groups is expected to operate at LOS B or better during
both AM and PM peak periods.

Proposed Access Road 2 (Site Entrance) is planned to be located on Poplin Road (SR
1508). This entrance was analyzed with an eastbound right-turn lane and a westbound
left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) (as determined by turn lane warrant analysis)
and separate left and right-turn lane on northbound (Access Road) approach. This
entrance with all the specific lane groups is expected to operate at LOS C or better during
both AM and PM peak periods.

Proposed Access Road 3 (Site Entrance) is planned to be located on N Rocky River Road
(SR 1514). This entrance was analyzed with a southbound right-turn lane and a
northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) (as determined by turn lane

(SR 1514). This entrance was analyzed with a northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky
River Road (SR 1514) (as determined by turn lane warrant analysis) and a single lane on
eastbound (Access Road) approach. This entrance with all the specific lane groups is
expected to operate at LOS B or better during both AM and PM peak periods.

Proposed Access Road 5 (Site Entrance) is planned to be located on N Rocky River Road
(SR 1514). This entrance was analyzed with a southbound right-turn lane and a
northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) (as determined by turn lane
warrant analysis) and separate left and right-turn lane on eastbound (Access Road)
approach. This entrance with all the specific lane groups is expected to operate at LOS C
or better during both AM and PM peak periods.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the capacity analyses conducted for the Southgate development,
the following improvements are recommended:

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Secrest Shortcut Road (SR
1501):
           • No additional turn lanes are required.
           • Based on maximum queue analysis the extension of the existing left-turn
               lanes are recommended even without the proposed Southgate
               development. In order to accommodate 2022 future traffic volumes, a
               maximum 250 feet storage is needed on Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR
               1367) for the eastbound and the westbound left-turn lanes, a maximum
               250 feet storage is needed on Secrest Shortcut Road (SR 1501) for the
               southbound and for the northbound left-turn lane. The developer should
               not be responsible for the extension of the eastbound, the northbound and
               the southbound left-turn lanes at this intersection.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and N Rocky River Road (SR
1514):
           • No improvements.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Poplin Road (SR 1508) (east
of Rocky River Road):

           •   No improvements.

Intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Poplin Road (SR 1508)

           •   No improvements. However, this intersection is a good candidate for
               future roundabout even without the proposed developments.

Intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Price Road (SR 1527):

According to the NCDOT (Based on Fieldstone Farms traffic study-June 2005), Union
County Schools are responsible for improvements at the intersection of Rocky River
Road (SR 1514) and Price Road (SR 1527). Price Road (SR 1527) will be the primary
access to the school sites. These improvements are as follows:

       •   Construct 150 feet westbound left turn lane on Price Road (complete)
       •   Construct 150 feet northbound right turn lane on Rocky River Road (not
           complete)
       •   Construct 150 feet southbound left turn lane on Rocky River Road (complete)
       •   Design and construct a traffic signal (not complete) upon meeting applicable
           traffic signal warrants as outlined in the latest edition of the Manual on
           Uniform Traffic Control Devices Handbook. (A signal study will be
           performed by NCDOT when the schools are completed. If a traffic signal is
           required, it will be the responsibility of NCDOT.)

Access Road 1 (West Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

   •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
       feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
       minimum 50 feet of storage.

Access Road 2 (East Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

   •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
       feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
       minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 3 (North Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.

   •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 4 (Mid Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   No separate southbound right-turn lane is warranted at this entrance.

Access Road 5 (South Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a minimum 50 feet of storage.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Poplin Road (SR 1508) (west
of Rocky River Road) was not analyzed based on approved scoping memorandum.
NCDOT initially recommends to provide a separate left-turn lane on Unionville Indian
Trail Road (SR 1367) due to the volume of through traffic on Unionville Indian Trail
Road (SR 1367). However, the recommended turn-lane will be demolished by the
proposed Monroe Bypass. Thus, no additional improvements are recommended at this
intersection.

2.0    INTRODUCTION
This Traffic Impact Study (TIS) addresses the potential traffic impacts associated with
the proposed Southgate residential development in Indian Trail, North Carolina (see
Project Vicinity Map, Figure 1). The proposed development is located at the southwest
corner of the intersection of Poplin Road (SR 1508) and N Rocky River Road (SR 1514).
As proposed, the residential development consists of 242 single-family units, 240
apartment units, 120 townhome units, and approximately 170,000 sq. feet of retail.

The TIS will assess existing traffic conditions as well as the traffic conditions that are
likely to occur upon the completion of the proposed development. The TIS will identify
transportation related impacts on the roadway network adjacent to the proposed
Southgate development. Specifically, the TIS will focus on the proposed project’s impact
area which includes those roadways and intersections located adjacent to the
development. Based on this analysis, recommendations for both on-site and off-site
transportation improvements will be developed.

The TIS will follow standard guidelines for a traffic impact study to support a
preliminary development plan, according to the following outline:

       •      Introduction
       •      Existing Roadway Conditions
       •      Existing Traffic Volumes
       •      Trip Generation and Trip Assignment
       •      Background Conditions (includes approved developments)
       •      Future Traffic Volumes
       •      Capacity Analysis
       •      Conclusion and Recommendations

3.0    EXISTING CONDITIONS
The proposed Southgate residential development is located at the southwest corner of the
intersection of Poplin Road (SR 1508) and N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) in Indian
Trail, North Carolina. The residential development consists of 242 single-family units,
240 apartment units, 120 townhome units and approximately 170,000 sq. feet of retail.
For this study, full buildout of the proposed development will occur by 2022. Two access
roads on Poplin Road (SR 1508) and three access roads on N Rocky River Road (SR
1514) will be included as part of the proposed Southgate development. (See Figure 2,
Site Plan).

The impact area for the analysis (see Figure 3) will include those roadways providing
access to the site including Poplin Road (SR 1508), N Rocky River Road (SR 1514), and
Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367). The TIS will focus on the existing and
projected future capacity analysis during peak hours at the following intersections:

4.0    EXISTING TRAFFIC
In order to determine existing traffic demands and vehicular flow patterns, manual AM
and PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected between 7:00 – 9:00 AM and
4:00 – 6:00 PM on Wednesday, April 24, Tuesday, April 30, and May 23, 2013 for the
following intersections:

       •      Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at Secrest Shortcut Road (SR
              1501)
       •      Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at N Rocky River Road (SR
              1514)
       •      Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) at Poplin Road (SR 1508)
       •      N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) at Poplin Road (SR 1508)
       •      N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) at Price Road (SR 1527)

Summarized traffic count sheets are attached in the Appendix. The existing traffic
volumes for the AM and the PM peak periods for the study intersection are summarized
in Table 1 and are graphically represented in Figure 4.

5.0    BACKGROUND (NO BUILD) CONDITIONS
For comparative purposes, an analysis of background or no build (without the project)
conditions was conducted. The background analysis included existing traffic, existing
geometry, background growth, and approved development traffic. Background growth
represents the increase in traffic due to unspecified growth anticipated to occur
throughout the project study area. Based on discussions with NCDOT staff and approved
methodology, an increase of 2 percent per year was applied to the existing traffic to
calculate base background traffic volumes. Approved development traffic is the traffic
generated by approved developments within the area of influence. Bonterra Village
developments located on Faith Church Road is the only development that will affect the
study area intersections. These approved trips were obtained from the Bonterra Village
Traffic Impact Study (DRMP, Inc. June 2013). The 2022 AM and PM peak hour
background traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5 and 6 respectively.

A review of the current NCDOT Transportation Improvement Program, 2013-2026,
indicates that no roadway improvements are planned in the vicinity of the proposed
development or within the area of influence.

6.0    BUILD CONDITION

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

As indicated previously, the proposed Southgate development will consist of 242 single-
family units, 240 apartment units, 120 townhome units, and 170,000 sq. feet of retail.
Two new access roads on Poplin Road (SR 1508) and three new access roads on N Rocky
River Road (SR 1514) will be included as part of the proposed Southgate development.
For the purpose of this study, full build-out of the proposed development is expected to
occur by 2022.

TRIP GENERATION

Trip generation can be defined as the estimation of the number of vehicular traffic
(entering and exiting) from a site as a result of the development of the site. Trip
generation for the proposed development was estimated based on the guidelines and
methodology published in the Institute of Transportation Engineer’s (ITE’s) “Trip
Generation Manual” Eighth Edition and “Trip Generation Handbook.” Trip generation
for the single-family units were calculated using the trip generation rates based on Land
Use Code 210 (Single Family Detached Housing), trip generation for the apartment
complex were calculated using the trip generation rates based on Land Use Code 220
(Apartment), trip generation rate for the townhomes were calculated using the trip
generation rates based on Land Use Code 230 (Residential Townhouse) and trip
generation rate for the retail were calculated using the trip generation rates based on Land
Use Code 820 (Shopping Center). For the shopping center, 10% was considered as
internal trips and 34% as pass-by trips during the PM peak.

The peak hour trip generation data for the proposed Southgate development is presented
in Table 2. With the proposed development, the results of the trip generation indicate
that the residential sites will generate a total of 372 AM peak hour trips and 485 PM peak
hour trips. Shopping center will generate a total of 189 AM peak hour net external trips,
539 PM Peak hour net external trips, and 278 PM peak hour pass-by trips.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

Based on the land use, existing traffic flow patterns and surrounding roadway network
trip distribution was estimated for the proposed development. It was estimated that for the
residential developments:

       25% of trips generated by Southgate development will travel to/from the north on
        N Rocky River Road (SR 1514).
       25% of trips generated by Southgate development will travel to/from the south on
        N Rocky River Road (SR 1514).
       15% of trips generated by Southgate development will travel to/from the east on
        Price Road (SR 1527).
       5% of trips generated by Southgate development will travel to/from the south on
        Poplin Road (SR 1508).

        N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) (local traffic).



PROJECTED TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Based on the above trip distribution, the estimated trips were assigned to the adjacent
streets of the proposed development. AM and PM peak hour trip distribution and
assignment are illustrated in Figures 7 and Figure 8 for the residential and commercial
developments. Figure 9 shows the pass-by trips for the shopping center. These trips
were added to the 2022 no-build traffic volumes. The projected 2022 AM and PM peak
hour traffic volumes with the development of the site are illustrated in Figures 10.

7.0    ANALYSIS APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY

Peak hour capacity analyses were conducted for the intersection identified within the
project’s impact area as well as for the site access intersection. The results of the
capacity analyses were used to determine the traffic impacts of the proposed development
on surrounding land uses and serves as a basis for identifying transportation deficiencies
and the need for improvements. The standard that is generally used to evaluate the
operating conditions of the transportation system is referred to as the level of service
(LOS). LOS is a qualitative measurement of traffic factors including speed, volume,
geometric features, interruptions, delay and the ability to maneuver.

The level of service/capacity analysis for the Southgate development was analyzed using
SYNCHRO/SimTraffic version 7.0, which is based on the analysis procedures contained
in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Existing geometry was based on field
observations and GIS data. The HCM defines six levels of service for intersections
ranging from LOS “A”, which represents the best operating conditions, to LOS “F”,
which represents the worst. The variable used for signalized and unsignalized
intersection Level of Service criteria is control delay. The LOS for an unsignalized
intersection is defined for the minor roadway approach.

Table 3 summarizes the relationship between control delay and Level of Service for
signalized and unsignalized intersections.

Required roadway and operational improvements were determined based on a
comparison between Background (No-Build) and Build conditions. For purposes of this
study, the Background condition was used as the base to determine project traffic
mitigation requirements. Using NCDOT’s “Traffic Impact Study Guidelines,” mitigation
improvements were recommended when one of the following conditions exists when
comparing base conditions to project conditions:

             •    Total average delay at an intersection increases by 25% or greater, while
                  maintaining the same level of service;
             •    The Level of Service degrades by at least one level; or
             •    The Level of Service is “F”

8.0       TURN LANE WARRANT ANALYSIS
Based on the “NCDOT Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina
Highways” guidelines, turn lane warrant analyses were performed on Poplin Road and N
Rocky River Road at the proposed Southgate site entrance. Figure “Warrant for Left and
Right-Turn Lanes” at page 80 of the NCDOT Policy on Street and Driveway Access to
North Carolina Highways was used to evaluate the turn lanes.

The results of the analyses are attached in Appendix B. Based on the guidelines and
projected traffic volumes the following recommendations are suggested for the site
entrances on Poplin Road (SR 1508) and N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

Access Road 1 (West Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

      •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
          feet of storage.
      •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
          minimum 50 feet of storage.

Access Road 2 (East Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

      •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
          feet of storage.
      •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
          minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 3 (North Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

      •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
          with a 100 feet of storage.
      •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
          with a minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 4 (Mid Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

      •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
          with a 100 feet of storage.
      •   No separate southbound right-turn lane is warranted at this entrance.

Access Road 5 (South Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

      •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
          with a 100 feet of storage.
      •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
          with a minimum 50 feet of storage.

9.0    TRAFFIC OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

Capacity analyses resulting in Level of Service (LOS) assignments were performed for
the study area intersections. The results of the capacity analysis were used to determine
the traffic impacts of the proposed development on surrounding land uses and serve as a
basis for identifying transportation deficiencies and the need for any improvements. The
results of the capacity analysis performed for each intersection are summarized in the
following sections. The computer printouts of the analyses are included in Appendix.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Secrest Shortcut Road
(SR 1501)

The intersection of Unionville Indian Trail and Secrest Shortcut Road (SR 1501) is
currently operating at an overall LOS C and all the approaches to this intersection are
operating at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak periods. For the
Background or 2022 No Build Condition, this intersection is expected to operate at an
overall LOS D during both the AM and PM peak periods.

With the proposed Southgate development traffic, this intersection would continue to
operate at an overall LOS D during both the AM and PM peak periods and all the
approaches to this intersection are expected to operate at LOS D or better. Thus, the
proposed Southgate development is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on
the operation of this intersection. As indicated in Table 4, overall as well as individual
approach delay as a result of traffic generated by the proposed development will not
increase by 25% or more and therefore, no improvements such as additional turn lanes
were recommended at this intersection.

A review of the maximum queue and blocking report shows that the existing storage
lengths (125 feet) for all the left-turn lanes at this intersection would not be adequate to
accommodate the future 2022 traffic volumes even without the proposed Southgate
development. In order to accommodate 2022 future traffic volumes, a maximum 250 feet

storage is needed on Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) for the eastbound and the
westbound left-turn lanes, a maximum 250 feet storage is needed on Secrest Shortcut
Road (SR 1501) for the southbound and for the northbound left-turn lane. The developer
should not be responsible for the extension of the eastbound, the northbound and the
southbound left-turn lanes at this intersection.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and N Rocky River Road
(SR 1514)

The intersection of Unionville Indian Trail and N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) is
currently operating at an overall LOS B and all the approaches to this intersection are
operating at LOS B or better during both the AM and PM peak periods. For the
Background or 2022 No Build Condition, this intersection is expected to operate at an
overall LOS B during both the AM and PM peak periods.

With the proposed Southgate development traffic, this intersection would continue to
operate at an overall acceptable LOS B during both the AM and PM peak periods and all
the approaches to this intersection are expected to operate at LOS B. Thus, the proposed
Southgate development is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the
operation of this intersection. As indicated in Table 6, overall as well as individual
approach delay as a result of traffic generated by the proposed development will not
increase by 25% or more and therefore, no improvements were recommended at this
intersection.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Poplin Road (SR 1508)

At the intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Poplin Road (SR
1508), the southbound approach is expected to operate at LOS C during the AM peak and
LOS B during the PM peak period and the northbound approach is expected to operate at
LOS B during both the AM and PM peak periods. For the Background or No Build
condition, the southbound approach is expected to operate at LOS D during the AM peak
and LOS C during the PM peak period and the northbound approach is expected to
operate at LOS C during both the AM and PM peak periods.

With the proposed Southgate development, the southbound approach is expected to
operate at LOS D during the AM peak and LOS C during the PM peak period and the
northbound approach is expected to operate at LOS C during both the AM and PM peak
periods. Thus, the proposed Southgate development is not expected to have a significant
adverse impact on the operation of this intersection. As indicated in Table 7, approach
delay as a result of traffic generated by the proposed development will not increase by
25% or more and therefore, no improvements were recommended at this intersection.

Intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Poplin Road (SR 1508)

At the intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Poplin Road (SR 1508), the
eastbound approach is currently operating at LOS E during the AM and LOS C during
the PM peak period. The westbound approach is operating at LOS B during both AM
and PM peak periods. For the Background or No Build condition, the eastbound approach
is expected to operate at LOS F during the AM peak and LOS C during the PM peak
period and the westbound approach is expected to operate at LOS B during both the AM
and PM peak periods.

With the proposed Southgate development, the eastbound approach is expected to operate
at LOS F during both AM peak and PM peak periods. It is not unusual for side street
traffic to experience long delays at unsignalized intersections during peak hours due to
left turning vehicles, but is typically considered a short term situation. The westbound
approach is expected to operate at LOS C during the AM and LOS D during the PM peak
period with the proposed developments. It is anticipated that the traffic generated by this
proposed development would not fully meet the requirements or warrants for a signal

the through traffic on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514). Therefore a traffic signal is not
recommended. However, this intersection needs to be monitored closely for possible
future roundabout even without the proposed developments.

Intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Price Road (SR 1527)

At the intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Price Road (SR 1527), the
westbound approach is currently operating at LOS D during the AM and LOS B during
the PM peak period. For the Background or No Build condition, the northbound
approach is expected to operate at LOS F during the AM peak and LOS C during the PM
peak period.

With the proposed Southgate development, the westbound approach is expected to
operate at LOS F during the AM peak and LOS E during the PM peak period. The
westbound approach is expected to operate at LOS F during the AM peak even without
the proposed Southgate development. This is due to AM peak hour school traffic at this

intersection. It is not unusual for side street traffic to experience long delays at
unsignalized intersections during peak hours due to left turning vehicles, but is typically
considered a short term situation. It is anticipated that the traffic generated by this
proposed development would not create any significant adverse impacts on the through
traffic on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514).

10.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the capacity analyses conducted for the Southgate development,
the following improvements are recommended:

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Secrest Shortcut Road (SR
1501):
           • No additional turn lanes are required.
           • Based on maximum queue analysis the extension of the existing left-turn
               lanes are recommended even without the proposed Southgate
               development. In order to accommodate 2022 future traffic volumes, a
               maximum 250 feet storage is needed on Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR
               1367) for the eastbound and the westbound left-turn lanes, a maximum
               250 feet storage is needed on Secrest Shortcut Road (SR 1501) for the
               southbound and for the northbound left-turn lane. The developer should
               not be responsible for the extension of the eastbound, the northbound and
               the southbound left-turn lanes at this intersection.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and N Rocky River Road (SR
1514):
           • No improvements.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Poplin Road (SR 1508) (east
of Rocky River Road):

           •   No improvements.

Intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Poplin Road (SR 1508)

           •   No improvements. However, this intersection is a good candidate for
               future roundabout even without the proposed developments.

Intersection of N Rocky River Road (SR 1514) and Price Road (SR 1527):

According to the NCDOT (Based on Fieldstone Farms traffic study-June 2005), Union
County Schools are responsible for improvements at the intersection of Rocky River
Road (SR 1514) and Price Road (SR 1527). Price Road (SR 1527) will be the primary
access to the school sites. These improvements are as follows:

       •   Construct 150 feet westbound left turn lane on Price Road (complete)
       •   Construct 150 feet northbound right turn lane on Rocky River Road (not
           complete)
       •   Construct 150 feet southbound left turn lane on Rocky River Road (complete)
       •   Design and construct a traffic signal (not complete) upon meeting applicable
           traffic signal warrants as outlined in the latest edition of the Manual on

          required, it will be the responsibility of NCDOT.)

Access Road 1 (West Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

   •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
       feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
       minimum 50 feet of storage.

Access Road 2 (East Site Entrance) on Poplin Road (SR 1508):

   •   Provide a separate westbound left-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a 100
       feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate eastbound right-turn lane on Poplin Road (SR 1508) with a
       minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 3 (North Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a minimum 75 feet of storage.

Access Road 4 (Mid Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   No separate southbound right-turn lane is warranted at this entrance.

Access Road 5 (South Entrance) on N Rocky River Road (SR 1514):

   •   Provide a separate northbound left-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a 100 feet of storage.
   •   Provide a separate southbound right-turn lane on N Rocky River Road (SR 1508)
       with a minimum 50 feet of storage.

Intersection of Unionville Indian Trail Road (SR 1367) and Poplin Road (SR 1508) (west
of Rocky River Road) was not analyzed based on approved scoping memorandum.
NCDOT initially recommends to provide a separate left-turn lane on Unionville Indian
Trail Road (SR 1367) due to the volume of through traffic on Unionville Indian Trail
Road (SR 1367). However, the recommended turn-lane will be demolished by the
proposed Monroe Bypass. Thus, no additional improvements are recommended at this
intersection.

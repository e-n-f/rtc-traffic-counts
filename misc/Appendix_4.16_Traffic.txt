Subject:       Traffic Impact Analysis for Chevron Facility Modernization Project EIR

                                                                                        WC11-2951


This memorandum summarizes the traffic impact analysis completed by Fehr & Peers for the
Chevron Facility Modernization Project EIR.          The memorandum summarizes existing traffic
conditions in the project vicinity, and estimates trip generation and evaluates impacts on traffic
operations at intersections in the project vicinity during project construction and after completion
of project construction.    This memorandum also identifies significant impacts, recommends
improvements to mitigate those impacts, and identifies traffic volume thresholds that trigger
those impacts and associated mitigation measures.

1. Study Area

Fehr & Peers analyzed traffic operations at the following 11 intersections, shown on Figure 1 (All
figures are provided at the end of this document), as part of this evaluation:


1.    Chevron Way/Marine Street                        7. Castro Street/Mills Street (Gate 31)
2.    Castro Street/Tewksbury Avenue                   8. Castro Street/Richmond Lane/General
3.    Marine Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps                  Chemical Access (Gate 91)
4.    Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps              9. Castro Street/Hensley Street
5.    Castro Street/Chevron Way                        10. Richmond Parkway/Hensley Street
6.    Castro Street/I-580 Westbound Ramps              11. Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue
      (Gate 14)


These intersections were selected because they provide access to the project site and would most
likely be impacted by the project construction or project operations.

2. Analysis Methodology

Study intersection operations were evaluated using level of service (LOS) calculations.        To
measure and describe the operational status of a local roadway network, transportation engineers
and planners commonly use a grading system called level of service (LOS). LOS is a description of
a transportation facility's operation, ranging from LOS A, indicating free-flow traffic conditions
with little or no delay experienced by motorists, to LOS F, which describes congested conditions
where traffic flows exceed design capacity, resulting in long queues and delays.


This evaluation uses the Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)
method to analyze intersection operations at all signalized and unsignalized study intersections.
The Synchro Software was used to estimate delay and LOS for all signalized and unsignalized
study intersections. Synchro uses the equations provided in 2000 HCM to calculate control delay.
These equations use intersection characteristics, such as vehicle and pedestrian volumes, lane
geometry, and signal phasings, as inputs in estimating control delay. The analysis methodology
for both signalized and unsignalized intersections are described below:

Signalized Intersections

The 2000 HCM method for signalized intersections evaluates average control delays and then
assign an LOS. Control delay is defined as the delay associated with deceleration, stopping,
moving up in the queue, and acceleration experienced by drivers at an intersection. Table 1
provides descriptions of various LOS and the corresponding ranges of delays for signalized
intersections.

Unsignalized Intersections

For unsignalized intersection, the 2000 HCM method calculates delay for movements that are
controlled by a stop sign or that must yield the right-of-way. The movement or approach with
the highest delay is reported. The LOS ranges for unsignalized intersections are shown in Table
1. They are lower than the delay ranges for signalized intersections because drivers generally
tolerate more delay at signals.

3. Existing Conditions

Fehr & Peers conducted peak period automobile intersection turning movement counts, as well
as pedestrian, bicycle and truck counts from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on
Tuesday, September 20, 2011, at all study intersections, while the Chevron Facility was operating
under normal conditions.

Based on the collected counts, the weekday morning peak hour occurs from 7:15 to 8:15 AM and
the evening peak hour occurs from 4:30 to 5:30 PM. Figure 1 shows the existing intersection
peak hour turning movements, intersection lane configurations and traffic controls. Appendix A
provides the detailed count sheets.

Table 2 summarizes the intersection operation analysis results based on the traffic volumes, lane
configurations, and traffic controls presented on Figure 1.                 Appendix B provides detailed
intersection LOS calculation worksheets.

The City of Richmond General Plan classifies Richmond Parkway and Castro Street as Routes of
                           1
Regional Significance.         Per West Contra Costa County Transportation Advisory Committee
(WCCTAC) and the City of Richmond, signalized and unsignalized intersections on Routes of
Regional Significance are considered to function at acceptable conditions if they operate at LOS D
            2
or better. As shown in Table 2, all study intersections operate at LOS D or better during both AM
and PM peak hours. These acceptable operations were confirmed by field observations.




 1
     As described in the City of Richmond General Plan, routes of regional significance are roadways that
     (1) connect to a regional highway/transit facility; (2) carry significant amount of traffic; (3) cross County
     boundaries; and/or (4) connect more than one region of the County.
 2
     The West Contra Costa County Transportation Advisory Committee's West Contra Costa County Action
     Plan 2009 Update (July 2009) establishes a Multi-Modal Traffic Service Objective of LOS D or better for
     intersections on Routes of Regional Significance. The City of Richmond General Plan policies state that
     LOS standards on routes of regional significance shall comply with WCCTAC's Action Plan.

4. Project Traffic Characteristics

Based on information provided by Chevron, the following are the primary sources of traffic
generation during Project construction:

       Facility Operations: Normal day-to-day operations of the Facility, which will continue
       through the duration of Project construction. Existing Facility operations traffic is part of the
       Existing Conditions previously discussed. Changes to operations-related traffic generation,
       following Project construction, would be minor, as described below.

       Project Construction: Construction worker and truck Traffic associated with Project
       construction, which includes the construction of Hydrogen Plant Replacement, Sulfur Removal
       Improvements, Hydrogen Plant tie-ins, and Project Design Features.

       Other Projects: Construction worker and truck Traffic associated with other construction
       projects that would coincide with Project construction.             This includes the Long Wharf
February 26, 2014
Page 6 of 32




    Maintenance and Efficiency Project, the Storage Tank Replacement Project, and other on-site
    projects and the Hensley Street and Kelham Warehouse Projects, both located east of Castro
    Street.

    Periodic Facility Maintenance:        Facility maintenance activities, including shutdowns for
    maintenance of major Facility components ("Major Turnarounds"), which are anticipated to
    occur during Project construction;

This analysis evaluates the impacts associated with both Project construction and changes to
Facility operations resulting from the Project construction. This analysis considers post-Project
operations-related traffic generation as a potential cumulative impact in relation to past, present
and reasonably foreseeable future projects. In addition, cumulative Project impacts associated
with Other Projects and Major Turnarounds are also addressed.

The following scenarios are considered:

    Baseline (2016) No Project Conditions

    Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Conditions

    Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Construction Conditions

    Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Construction Plus Major Facility
    Turnaround Conditions

    Cumulative (2030) Conditions (assuming Facility operations, and changes to existing
    operations-related traffic generation, following Project construction).

For the Cumulative (2030) conditions, the Project would be in its operational phase
(i.e., construction of its components would have been completed). The year 2030 was selected for
the cumulative analysis due to the availability of traffic projections for that year from regional
transportation authorities, and that the Project would have been fully operational for many years
as of that time, and because this 2030 projection includes regional growth factors by expert
agencies that are considered representative of long-term conditions. Specifically, the 2006 Contra
Costa Transportation Authority Travel Demand Forecasting Model (CCTA Model) was used to
forecast 2030 conditions. The CCTA Model forecasts include the most up-to-date information
regarding City and County land use and transportation improvement information for both Contra
Costa and Alameda Counties and also the greater Bay Area. The CCTA Model uses Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Projections 2009 for land use and employment.              The City of
February 26, 2014

Richmond Preferred General Plan Alternative land use assumptions were used in the CCTA model
to more accurately reflect expected growth in Richmond.

Operation of the Facility following Project construction would result in 29 new employees and
generate about 94 new daily one-way truck trips because of increased import and export of
materials to and from the Facility, which corresponds to 100 percent Facility utilization.

Trip Generation

Trip generation refers to the process of estimating the amount of vehicular traffic a project would
add to the roadway network. The automobile traffic generated by the Project (and Other Projects,
and Major Facility Turnarounds) was estimated based on data provided by Chevron.                     These
estimates include both construction-related passenger car and truck trips.            Truck trips were
                                                3
converted to Passenger Car Equivalents (PCE) to more accurately reflect the potential impacts of
trucks on traffic flow. Table 3 summarizes and Appendix C provides more detailed data on the
estimated increase in daily traffic during the construction period. The table includes estimates not
only for Project construction traffic, but also estimates for trip generation associated with Other
Projects and Major Turnarounds, and to be conservative assumes these activities will coincide as
Project construction. Major Turnarounds, in particular, can be scheduled at various times of the
year, but for analytical purposes it has been assumed that a Major Turnaround could occur in the
first quarter of 2016 (when Project construction traffic is estimated to be at its highest level).

Table 4 presents the AM and PM peak hour traffic generation estimates for the peak construction
period of the Project, and the Other Projects, and the Major Turnaround that would coincide with
the planned Project construction. Peak construction activity is expected to occur during the first
quarter of 2016, when the Project, the Other Project, and the Major Turnaround combined are
estimated to generate 7,503 trips on a typical day, 1,878 trips during the AM peak hour, and 1,743
trips during the PM peak hour.

  Passenger-car equivalent (PCE) represents the number of passenger cars displaced by each truck in the
traffic stream. One truck is the equivalent of two passenger cars for this analysis.

 1 All vehicle and truck trips are shown as one-way trips per day. A round trip equals two trips. See Appendix C, for a breakdown of estimated daily traffic associated with separate
   individual projects.
 2 Miscellaneous construction support include lunch wagons, fueling, parts runs, etc.
 3 Construction related trips (either vehicle or PCE) equals ONLY Project traffic. This is the basis for traffic impact evaluations and is shown reversed above.
 4 Major turnarounds do not result from the Modernization Project and are shown here to provide an idea of total variability in Facility traffic. Totals reflect peak periods, and therefore
   are not at these levels for the entire quarter. Estimated durations of turnarounds vary from 18 to 38 days per turnaround. Turnaround schedules are subject to change (estimated
   traffic is based on Richmond Facility Long Range Shut Down Schedule, as of January 29, 2007). This analysis assumes that peak turnaround would coincide with peak activity
   generated by the Project Construction and Other Projects.

2 For peak hour trip generation, assume all inbound trips occur during the AM peak hour and all outbound trips occur
  during the PM peak hour, as shown:
       Half of the vehicle trips arrive at 6:00 AM for a 10-hour shift, departing at 4:00 PM.
       Half of the vehicle trips arrive at 7:00 AM for a 10-hour shift, departing at 5:00 PM.
       Assume all trucks are inbound in the AM and outbound in the PM.
       Assume half trucks arrive at 7:00 AM and depart at 3:00 PM; half arrive at 6:00 AM and depart at 2:00 PM.
       (Therefore, no trucks during the PM peak hour analysis period.)

Trip Distribution

The trip distribution process estimates how the vehicle trips generated by a project site would
distribute across the roadway network. The trip distribution of the construction-related vehicle
trips was based on current observations at the Chevron Richmond Facility and a previous study
(Cleaner Fuels Project Circulation Analysis).        Table 5 summarizes the trip distribution of the
construction-related traffic. Both passenger vehicles and trucks generated by the Project are
expected to depart and arrive from the following routes:

    North: to and from Richmond Parkway
    South: to and from I-580

Trip Assignment

The AM and PM peak hour peak construction-generated trip generation estimates were applied
to the distribution paths described above, and the construction period trips were assigned to
Gates 91 and 31, with the majority of the trips to/from Gate 91. The assigned Project construction
trips were added to AM and PM peak hour volumes under the Baseline (2016) No Project
Conditions to estimate the Baseline (2016) with-Project traffic volumes and to determine Project-
specific construction impacts to study intersections.

5. Baseline (2016) No Project Conditions

The year 2016 was selected for the analysis of construction traffic impacts because construction
traffic is expected to peak during the first quarter of 2016 (See Table 3). Intersection volumes in
2016 were interpolated using the 2011 measured traffic volumes and forecast growth rates
developed using the Contra Costa County Transportation Authority Travel Demand Model (CCTA
Model), as described in more detail below, to calculate the adjusted traffic Baseline. The impact
February 26, 2014
Page 12 of 32




of the Project construction was estimated by evaluating how intersection LOS would change with
the addition of construction-related traffic to this Baseline.

Although renovation work is currently underway on I-580 between the Chevron Facility and
Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, this renovation work is anticipated to be completed prior to the
expected start of Project construction in 2016. There are no other traffic-related improvements
that are anticipated to change traffic conditions in 2016 relative to the conditions measured in
2011. Therefore, the intersection lane configurations and controls presented on Figure 1 continue
to remain valid.

Project impacts are analyzed by comparing conditions with and without Project-generated traffic.
The "without Project" (2016 Baseline) scenario represents reasonably-foreseeable conditions in
2016 without the addition of Project construction traffic. Current Facility operations will continue
through the duration of Project construction, and existing traffic counts conducted at the study
intersections and projected for Baseline conditions reflect the current operations. As described
above, Project construction-generated traffic is expected to fluctuate during construction. The
highest Project construction-generated traffic is expected in the first quarter of 2016. Therefore,
the traffic impacts associated with the Project construction traffic were assessed under 2016
conditions.

Intersection volumes under Baseline conditions were interpolated using forecast growth rates
developed using the Contra Costa County Transportation Authority Travel Demand Model (CCTA
Model).     CCTA Model was checked to ensure that it includes other planned and approved
development projects within the City of Richmond expected to generate traffic in the year 2016
(see Appendix 4.0, Cumulative Projects), and it was determined that the CCTA model growth
forecasts encompass the planned and approved development projects.            Figure 2 shows the
intersection peak hour volumes under Baseline (2016) No Project conditions.

Table 6 shows the results of the intersection operations analysis for 2016 Baseline conditions.
Under 2016 Baseline conditions (without Project), all study intersections would operate at
acceptable LOS C or better during the AM peak hour. During the PM peak hour, eight of the 11
study intersections are estimated to operate at acceptable LOS D or better.              The three
intersections projected to operate at an unacceptable service (LOS E or F) during the PM peak
hour are:

6. Traffic Impact Significance Criteria

As previously described, both WCCTAC and the City of Richmond consider intersections on
Routes of Regional Significance to function at acceptable conditions if they operate at LOS D or
better. This analysis identifies impacts by comparing peak hour intersection operations under
Baseline (2016) Plus Project scenarios with Baseline (2016) No Project conditions. Consistent with
WCCTAC and City of Richmond requirements, this analysis identifies an impact as significant if the
Project would cause:

       A signalized intersection to deteriorate from LOS D or better to LOS E or LOS F.
February 26, 2014
Page 14 of 32




    A signalized intersection where the level of service is LOS E, the Project would cause the
    average control delay to increase by more than five seconds or deteriorate to LOS F.
    A signalized intersection where the level of service is LOS F, the Project would cause the
    average control delay to increase by more than five seconds.
    An unsignalized intersection to operate at LOS F and after Project completion satisfy the
    Caltrans peak hour traffic volume signal warrant.

7. Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Conditions

The AM and PM peak hour traffic generated during the Project Construction (as shown in Table 4)
were added to the Baseline (2016) No Project traffic volumes to estimate traffic volumes under
Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction conditions. Figure 3 shows the intersection peak hour
volumes under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction conditions.

Table 7 shows the results of the intersection operations analysis for the weekday AM and PM
peak hours under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction conditions. Under Baseline (2016)
Plus Project Construction conditions, all intersections would operate at acceptable LOS during the
AM peak period. Eight of the 11 study intersections are forecast to operate at acceptable LOS D
or better during the PM peak hour.         The three intersections projected to operate at an
unacceptable service (LOS E or F) during the PM peak are:

        Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps
        Castro Street/Redwood Way/I-580 Westbound Ramps
        Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue

The Project impact at the Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps intersection is considered less-
than-significant, because conditions would remain unchanged at LOS F, with average delay
remaining the same.

Project Construction would result in two significant impacts which can be mitigated to less-than-
significant levels. Table 8 summarizes intersection operations under Baseline (2016) Plus Project
Construction conditions with and without the mitigation measures.        Both impacts and their
mitigation measures are described below:

Impact 1: Project construction-generated increases in traffic volumes would result in a
               significant impact during the PM peak hour at the signalized Castro Street/I-580
               Westbound Ramps intersection. This impact would be mitigated to a less-than-
               significant level by implementation of Mitigation Measure 1.

               Project construction-related traffic is projected to add a substantial amount of traffic
               to the critical movements of the Castro Street/I-580 Westbound Ramps intersection,
               which would result in a significant worsening of its operating conditions (from LOS E
               to LOS F during the PM peak hour)

           Mitigation Measure 1: Implement the following measures at the Castro Street/I-580
           Westbound Ramps intersection:

             Chevron shall work with the City of Richmond's Director of Public Works Department
               (or the Director's designated representative) and Caltrans to provide modified traffic
               control during peak arrival and departure times in the PM peak hour. The modified
               traffic control shall be accomplished by one or more of the following methods:
               (1) posting a technician at the intersection to manually operate signal controls (using
               the police key feature of standard traffic signal controllers), (2) programming an
               alternate signal timing plan that would be in operation during specified peak
               commute periods, and/or (3) posting traffic control officers at the intersection to
               manually control traffic movements. Chevron shall pay the full cost of this measure,
               including costs for sheriff's deputies or other law enforcement personnel to provide
               the traffic control under above-cited methods (1) or (3).

               Implementation of Mitigation Measure 1 would improve intersection operating
               conditions to LOS D during the PM peak hour, resulting in a less than significant
               impact after mitigation.

Impact 2: Project construction-generated increases in traffic volumes would result in a
               significant impact during the PM peak hour at the signalized Richmond Parkway/
February 26, 2014
Page 17 of 32




          Gertrude Avenue intersection. This impact would be mitigated to a less-than-
          significant level by implementation of Mitigation Measure 2.

          Project construction-related traffic is projected to add a substantial amount of traffic
          to the critical movements of the Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue intersection,
          which would result in a significant worsening of its operating conditions. (The
          intersection would continue to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour with the
          Project increasing average intersection delay by about 14 seconds).

    Mitigation Measure 2 Implement the following measures at the Richmond Parkway/Gertrude
    Avenue              :

        Chevron shall work with the City of Richmond's Director of Public Works Department
          (or the Director's designated representative) to provide modified traffic control during
          peak arrival and departure times in the PM peak hour. The modified traffic control
          shall be accomplished by one or more of the following methods: (1) posting a
          technician at the intersection to manually operate signal controls (using the police key
          feature of standard traffic signal controllers), (2) programming an alternate signal
          timing plan that would be in operation during specified peak commute periods, and/
          or (3) posting traffic control officers at the intersection to manually control traffic
          movements.        Chevron shall pay the full cost of this measure, including costs for
          sheriff's deputies or other law enforcement personnel to provide the traffic control
          under above-cited methods (1) or (3).
        During the peak congestion periods, through the use of traffic cones (and flaggers as
          needed), Chevron shall reconfigure the southbound (Richmond Parkway) approach to
          the intersection to provide one shared left-through lane, one through lane, and one
          shared right-through lane.

          Implementation of Mitigation Measure 2 would improve intersection operating
          conditions to LOS E during the PM peak hour, resulting in a less than significant
          impact.

In addition to the above mitigation measures, implementation of one or more of the following
strategies would also reduce the constructed related traffic during Project Construction and
reduce the magnitude of the Project impact at the study intersections during the AM and PM
peak hours:
February 26, 2014
Page 18 of 32




         Stagger the hours of operation of the craft labor so that the construction-related
            traffic would be distributed over the peak and non-peak hours of traffic operation.
         Promote the use of car-sharing by the craft labor.
         Coordinate the construction schedule between the Project, construction of the Other
            Projects, and the Major Facility Turnaround, to minimize combined traffic generation
            on any single day.

8. Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Conditions

This section addresses potential impacts of the Project Construction combined with construction
of Other Projects that would occur at the same time. As shown in Table 3, Project Construction
and Other Projects combined are expected to peak during the first quarter of 2016. The AM and
PM peak hour traffic generated by the Other Projects (as shown in Table 4) were added to the
Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction traffic volumes to estimate traffic volumes under
Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects conditions. Figure 4 shows the
intersection peak hour volumes under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other
Projects conditions.

Table 9 shows the results of the intersection operations analysis for the weekday AM and PM
peak hours under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects conditions. Under
Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects conditions, all intersections would
operate at acceptable LOS during the AM peak period. Seven of the 11 study intersections are
forecast to operate at acceptable LOS D or better during the PM peak hour.                The four
intersections projected to operate at an unacceptable service (LOS E or F) during the PM peak are:

        Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps
        Castro Street/Redwood Way/I-580 Westbound Ramps
        Castro Street/Hensley Street
        Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue

The impact at the Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps intersection is considered less-than-
significant, because conditions would remain unchanged at LOS F, with average delay remaining
the same.

Project Construction and Other Projects combined would result in three significant impacts which
can be mitigated to less-than-significant levels. Table 10 summarizes intersection operations
under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects conditions with and without
the mitigation measures. The three impacts and their mitigation measures are described below:

Impact 3: Project Construction plus Other Projects-generated increases in traffic volumes
               would result in a significant impact during the PM peak hour at the signalized

               Project Construction-related traffic combined with Other Project construction-related
               traffic is projected to add a substantial amount of traffic to the critical movements of

          the Castro Street/Hensley Street intersection, which would result in a significant
          worsening of its operating conditions (From LOS C to LOS F during the PM peak hour).

       Mitigation Measure 4: Implement the following measures at the Castro Street/Hensley
       Street intersection:

        Chevron shall work with the City of Richmond's Director of Public Works Department
          (or the Director's designated representative) to provide modified traffic control during
          peak arrival and departure times in the PM peak hour. The modified traffic control
          shall be accomplished by one or more of the following methods: (1) posting a
          technician at the intersection to manually operate signal controls (using the police key
          feature of standard traffic signal controllers), (2) programming an alternate signal
          timing plan that would be in operation during specified peak commute periods, and/
          or (3) posting traffic control officers at the intersection to manually control traffic
          movements.     Chevron shall pay the full cost of this measure, including costs for
          sheriff's deputies or other law enforcement personnel to provide the traffic control
          under above-cited methods (1) or (3).

          Implementation of Mitigation Measure 4 would improve intersection operating
          conditions to LOS C during the PM peak hour, resulting in a less-than-significant
          impact.

Impact 5: Project Construction plus Other Projects-generated increases in traffic volumes
          would result in a significant impact during the PM peak hour at the signalized
          Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue intersection.               This impact would be
          mitigated to a less-than-significant level by implementation of Mitigation
          Measure 5.

          significant worsening of its operating conditions (The intersection would continue to
          operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour with the Project increasing average
          intersection delay by about 23 seconds).

9. Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Plus Major Turnaround
   Conditions

This section addresses potential impacts of the Project Construction combined with construction
of Other Projects and a Major Turnaround that would occur at the same time. This analysis
assumes that a Major Turnaround would occur during the first quarter of 2016, when the traffic
generated by the combined Project Construction and Other Projects would peak. The AM and
PM peak hour traffic generated by the Major Turnaround (as shown in Table 4) were added to the
Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects traffic volumes to estimate traffic
volumes under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Plus Major
Turnaround conditions.    Figure 5 shows the intersection peak hour volumes under Baseline
(2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Plus Major Turnaround conditions.

Table 11 shows the results of the intersection operations analysis for the weekday AM and PM
peak hours under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Plus Major
Turnaround conditions. Under Baseline (2016) Plus Project Construction Plus Other Projects Plus
Major Turnaround conditions, nine of the 11 study intersections during the AM peak hour and six
of the 11 study intersections during the PM peak hour would operate at acceptable LOS D or
better. The four intersections projected to operate at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) during
either or both peak hours are listed below:

        Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps (PM only)
        Castro Street/Redwood Way/I-580 Westbound Ramps (PM only)
        Castro Street/General Chemical Access (AM and PM)
        Castro Street/Hensley Street (PM only)
        Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue (AM and PM)

The impact at the Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps intersection is considered less-than-
significant, because conditions would remain unchanged at LOS F, with average delay remaining
the same.

Project Construction-related traffic combined with Other Project construction and Major
Turnaround-related traffic is projected to add a substantial amount of traffic to the critical
movements of the Castro Street/I-580 Westbound Ramps intersection, which would result in a
significant worsening of its operating conditions (from LOS E to LOS F during the PM peak hour).

          (from LOS A during the AM peak hour and LOS during the PM peak hour to LOS F
          during both AM and PM peak hours).

       Mitigation Measure 7: Implement the following measures at the intersection of Castro
       Street/General Chemical Access (Gate 91) intersection:

        During the AM peak period, through the use of traffic cones (and flaggers as needed),
          Chevron shall reconfigure the northbound (Castro Street) approach to the intersection
          to provide two left-turn lanes, and one shared right-through lane.           The inbound
          approach on General Chemical Access would also be reconfigured to provide two
          receiving lanes.
        During the PM peak period, through the use of traffic cones (and flaggers as needed),
          Chevron shall reconfigure the eastbound (General Chemical Access) approach to the
          intersection to provide two exclusive right-turn lanes, and one exclusive left-turn lane.
        Chevron shall work with the City of Richmond's Director of Public Works Department
          (or the Director's designated representative) to provide modified traffic contr ol during
          peak arrival and departure times in the AM and PM peak hours. The modified traffic
          control shall be accomplished by one or more of the following methods: (1) posting a
          technician at the intersection to manually operate signal controls (using the police key
          feature of standard traffic signal controllers), (2) programming an alternate signal
          timing plan that would be in operation during specified peak commute periods,
          and/or (3) posting traffic control officers at the intersection to manually control traffic
          movements.     Chevron shall pay the full cost of this measure, including costs for
          sheriff's deputies or other law enforcement personnel to provide the traffic control
          under above-cited methods (1) or (3).

          Implementation of Mitigation Measure 7 would improve intersection operating
          conditions to LOS D during both AM and PM peak hours.

Impact 8: Project Construction plus Other Projects Plus Major Turnaround-generated
          increases in traffic volumes would result in a significant impact during the PM
          peak hour at the signalized Castro Street/Hensley Street intersection.            This
          impact would be mitigated to a less-than-significant level by implementation of
          Mitigation Measure 8.

       Mitigation Measure 8: Implementation of Mitigation Measure 4 would improve
       intersection operating conditions to LOS D during the PM peak hour, resulting in a less-
       than-significant impact.

Impact 9: Project Construction Plus Other Projects Plus Major Turnaround-generated
          increases in traffic volumes would result in a significant impact during AM and
          PM peak hours at the signalized Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue

          during the PM peak hour with the Project increasing average intersection delay by
          about 34 seconds).

       Mitigation Measure 9: Implementation of Mitigation Measure 2 would improve
       intersection operating conditions to LOS B during the AM peak hour and LOS E during

10. Cumulative (2030) Conditions

The Cumulative 2030 scenario, which is defined by the horizon year of the CCTA countywide
travel demand model, was assessed to determine long-term traffic impacts associated with
buildout conditions in the area.   The locations and sizes of the major development projects
envisioned in the county and cities' General Plans have been programmed into the CCTA Model,
which reflects regional growth based on projections that are consistent with forecasts by ABAG.
In the vicinity of the Project, the Cumulative (2030) scenario accounts for the completion and
occupancy of the proposed Hensley Street and Kelham Warehouse Projects.

Traffic operating conditions on project-used roadways in 2030 would be adversely affected by
growth in population and employment in the area. Table 13 presents intersection operations for
the weekday AM and PM peak hours under Cumulative 2030 conditions. Under Cumulative (2030)
conditions, 3 of the 11 study intersections are forecast to operate at acceptable LOS D or better
during both peak hours. The eight intersections projected to operate at an unacceptable level of
service (LOS E or F) during one or both peak hour are:

        Marine Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps (LOS F in PM peak hour)
        Castro Street/I-580 Eastbound Ramps (LOS F in PM peak hour)
        Castro Street/I-580 Westbound Ramps (LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM
        peak hour)
        Castro Street/Mills Street (LOS E in PM peak hour)
        Castro Street/General Chemical Access (LOS F in PM peak hour)
        Castro Street/Hensley Street (LOS F in the PM peak hour).
        Richmond Parkway/Hensley Street (LOS E in the AM peak hour).
        Richmond Parkway/Gertrude Avenue (LOS F in the PM peak hour).

For the Cumulative (2030) scenario, the Project would be in its operational phase
(i.e., construction of its components would have already been completed).

Table 14 presents the new trips that would be generated by the Chevron Facility after completion
of construction assuming 100 percent facility utilization.            Operation of the Facility following
Project construction would generate about 94 new daily one-way truck trips (corresponding to
188 PCE trips) because of increased import and export of materials to and from the Facility.
Although, the additional truck trips would be spread over the operating hours of the day and are
expected to occur primarily during off-peak traffic hours, this analysis conservatively assumes that
they will be spread uniformly throughout the day. Facility permanent employment levels would
increase by 29 employees, resulting in a maximum of 58 new daily commuter trips.

The Project's contribution to the unacceptable levels of service described above were determined
on the basis of reasonably-conservative assumptions that 48 new PCE trips would occur during
the peak traffic hours. The Project contribution would be less than one percent and that level of
additional vehicles on area roadways during peak traffic hours would be within the typical
fluctuation in day-to-day traffic volumes and would not be noticed by most drivers; therefore, its
effect on traffic operating conditions would not be cumulatively considerable.

11. Threshold Analysis

This section identifies the following for each of the intersections identified as having a significant
impact:

      a.   The peak hour traffic volume threshold that triggers the significant impact.
      b. The peak hour traffic volume threshold that the recommended mitigation measure would
           no longer be sufficient.

Table 15 summarizes the thresholds for the identified impacts and mitigation measures. For each
impacted intersection, the table shows the additional volume generated by the Project
Construction (by itself or combined with Other Projects and the Major Turnaround) that would
trigger an impact and the range where the recommended mitigation measures would continue to
mitigate the identified impact to a less-than-significant level.

Potala Village                                                                         May 2011



                                 Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the transportation impact analysis for the
Potala Village development through a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

Where is the site located?
The project is located on the southeast corner of the Lake Street S and 10th Avenue S
intersection in Kirkland, Washington. It is comprised of two parcels, 1006 and 1020 Lake
Street. Access to the underground parking garage is proposed via one full access driveway
along Lake Street S.

What is the land use and trip generation?
The project would develop approximately 143 residential units and 6,186 square-feet of
commercial use consisting of approximately 3,186 square-feet of general office and 3,000
square-feet of medical office use. The proposal includes 316 parking stalls.

Trip generation was estimated based on average trip rates from ITE’s Trip Generation, 8th
Edition. The proposed project would generate approximately 1,070 net new daily trips with 86
trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 111 trips occurring during the PM peak hour.

What are the existing and future without-project conditions in the study area?
All study intersections currently operate at LOS D or better except 116th Avenue NE/I-405
Northbound Ramp, which operates at LOS E during the weekday PM peak hour. Anticipated
increases in traffic volumes by 2012 would degrade operations at the 108th Avenue NE/NE
68th Street and NE 72nd Place/I-405 Southbound Ramp intersections to LOS E and the
116th Avenue NE/I-405 Northbound Ramp intersection to LOS F. All other study intersections
would continue to operate at LOS C or better under baseline 2012 conditions.

Would the project have any transportation impacts?
Project traffic represents a proportional share at the signalized study intersections of less
than three percent. The addition of project traffic is not anticipated to have a SEPA impact as
defined by the City of Kirkland.

How would the site access operate?
The proposed project driveway is anticipated to operate at LOS D during the weekday PM
peak hour. There would be adequate sight distance at the proposed driveway. In addition, a
gap analysis shows that based on existing data there are sufficient vehicle gaps to
accommodate the inbound and outbound left-turn movements to and from the site access.

Is there adequate parking supply?
The proposed parking supply would accommodate the anticipated parking demand and meet
the City’s parking code requirements.

What mitigation measures are recommended?
The developer would be required to pay the City of Kirkland transportation impact fees, which
are preliminarily estimated at $382,500. These fees are provided as estimates only and will
be finalized by the City.

Potala Village                                                                           May 2011



                                         Introduction
The purpose of this transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to identify potential transportation-
related impacts along the surrounding roadway network associated with the proposed Potala
Village. As necessary, mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce State
Environmental Policy Action (SEPA) impacts as defined by the City of Kirkland.

Project Description
Figure 1 illustrates the project site and the surrounding vicinity. The project is located in
Kirkland, Washington at the southeast corner of the Lake Street S and 10th Avenue S
intersection. It is comprised of two parcels, 1006 and 1020 Lake Street. The project would
develop approximately 143 residential units and 6,186 square-feet of commercial use
consisting of 3,186 square-feet of general office and 3,000 square-feet of medical office use.
The site is currently occupied by an approximately 1,500 square-foot dry cleaner and a small
café.

A preliminary site plan is shown on Figure 2. Access to the project site would be provided via
one full access driveway along Lake Street S. The access would be into the parking garage,
which would have 316 parking spaces. The project is anticipated to be constructed and
occupied by 2012.

Study Area and Scope
The transportation analysis scope and approach were identified through coordination with
City of Kirkland staff. Based on the City’s Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines
(February 2004), the study intersections are those identified as significant based on the City’s
proportional share impact worksheets. Appendix A contains the worksheets for the study
area. In addition, the City requested an evaluation of the Lake Street S/10th Avenue S and
State Street S/10th Avenue S intersections as well as the site driveway. The study
intersections, listed below and shown in Figure 1, represent locations within the project
vicinity that would experience impacts as defined by the City:

    1. Lake Street S/10th Avenue S
    2. State Street S/10th Avenue S
    3. State Street S/NE 68th Street
    4. 108th Avenue NE/NE 68th Street
    5. Lake Washington Boulevard NE/Lakeview Drive
    6. Lake Washington Boulevard NE/NE 38th Place
    7. NE 72nd Place/I-405 Southbound Ramp
    8. 116th Avenue NE/I-405 Northbound Ramp
    9. NE 70th Place/116th Avenue NE

Consistent with the City TIA guidelines, the analysis focuses on the weekday PM peak period
(4:00 to 6:00 p.m.). The TIA begins by describing conditions in the site vicinity, including
roadway network, existing and future (2012) weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit. Future with-project conditions
are evaluated by adding site-generated traffic to future baseline volumes. Analysis of future
conditions addresses cumulative impacts of the proposed project and traffic growth in the
study area. Site-generated impacts are identified based on differences in transportation
conditions between with-and without-project conditions.

                 Existing and Baseline Conditions
This section describes existing and future baseline (without-project) conditions within the
identified study area. Characteristics are provided for the roadway network, peak hour traffic
volumes, traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit.


Roadway Network
The proposed project is located along Lake Street S at 10th Avenue S. The major roadways
in the study area are listed and described below:

Lake Street S/Lake Washington Boulevard NE extends north-south from Central Way to
Northup Way. The City classifies this roadway as a principal arterial. It has a posted speed
limit of 30 to 35 mph within the study area. Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are provided on both
sides.

108th Avenue NE extends north-south from NE 38th Place to Central Way/NE 85th Street.
The City classifies this roadway as a minor arterial. It has a posted speed limit of 25 to 30
mph within the study area. Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are provided on both sides.

Lakeview Drive/NE 68th Street/NE 72nd Place/NE 70th Place extends north-south from
Lake Washington Boulevard NE to State Street and then east-west from State Street to
132nd Avenue NE. The City classifies this roadway as a minor arterial. It has a posted speed
limit of 25 to 30 mph within the study area. Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are provided on both
sides.

State Street extends north-south from Lakeview Drive to Central Way. The City classifies this
roadway as a minor arterial. It has a posted speed limit of 25 mph within the study area.
Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are provided on both sides.

116th Avenue NE extends north-south from the Kirkland City limits to NE 80th Street. The
City classifies this roadway as a collector. It has a posted speed limit of 25 to 30 mph within
the study area. Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are provided on both sides.

NE 38th Place extends between Lake Washington Boulevard NE and 108th Avenue NE. The
City classifies this roadway as a collector. It has a posted speed limit of 25 mph within the
study area. Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are provided on both sides.

Planned Transportation Improvements
The Kirkland 2009-2014 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) was reviewed to determine if
there were 2012 funded transportation improvements in the study area. Based on a review of
the program, there are no funded transportation improvements for the study intersections.
The City is currently going through the adoption process for the 2011-2016 CIP. This plan
also does not include any transportation improvements in the study area.


Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday PM peak hour turning movement counts at the study intersections were
conducted in early December 2010. Intersection turning movement counts are provided in
Appendix B. Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes are summarized on Figure 3 and
were used to evaluate existing traffic conditions. The City provided weekday PM peak hour
future baseline 2012 traffic forecasts. These forecasts were developed based on the City’s
traffic model. The Lake Street S/10th Avenue S and State Street S/10th Avenue S
intersections are not included in the City’s model. Based on coordination with City staff, future



                                                                                           Page 4

traffic volumes were developed by applying a two-percent per year growth rate to the existing
traffic volumes and adding the planned Park Place development traffic. This method provides
a future 2012 forecast for the 10th Avenue S locations consistent with the City’s traffic model.
Baseline intersection volumes for the weekday PM peak hour are shown in Figure 4.


Traffic Operations
Traffic operations are characterized through an intersection level of service (LOS) analysis.
LOS is a widely applied analysis technique for measuring the Quality of traffic flow through
intersections and comparing resulting traffic operations to adopted standards. Kirkland’s
adopted intersection LOS standard is LOS D or better. WSDOT also has an adopted LOS D
standard for urban highways of statewide significant, which includes I-405.

LOS values range from LOS A indicating free-flow traffic to LOS F indicating extreme
congestion and long vehicle delays. Existing and baseline LOS, delays, and volume-to-
capacity (v/c) ratios were calculated using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 method
and Synchro (version 7.0). Appendix C provides a more detailed explanation of intersection
LOS. This method uses peak hour traffic volumes, intersection geometry, intersection control,
and roadway characteristics as inputs to evaluate operations. Table 1 summarizes the
existing and baseline weekday PM peak hour intersection operations. Detailed LOS
worksheets are provided in Appendix D.

As shown in the table, all study intersections operate at LOS D or better except the
116th Avenue NE/I-405 Northbound Ramps, which operates at LOS E. Future 2012
increases in traffic would degrade operations at the 108th Avenue NE/NE 68th Street and
NE 72nd Place/I-405 Southbound Ramp intersections to LOS E and the 116th Avenue NE/I-
405 Northbound Ramp intersection to LOS F. All other study intersections would continue to
operate at LOS C or better under baseline 2012 conditions during the weekday PM peak
hour.

Traffic Safety
Collision data provided by WSDOT for the most recent three-year period, January 1, 2007 –
December 31, 2009, was examined to determine if a high volume of collisions or any patterns
indicate potential safety issues within the study area. Table 2 provides a summary of the
collision data at the study intersections.

As shown in the table, a majority of the study intersections have less than two collisions per
year except for the intersections in the vicinity of I-405 interchange, which have four to six
collisions per year. The I-405 interchanges are signalized and field observations and existing
intersection LOS show that these locations are congested during peak periods. The majority
of the collisions at these intersections are rear-end accidents, which are typical at congested
signalized locations that have stop-and-go traffic conditions.

Non-Motorized Facilities
Sidewalks are provided along both sides of roadways throughout the study area including
along Lake Street S and 10th Avenue S. An unsignalized crosswalk is provided across
Lake Street S at 10th Avenue S near the project site. Bicycle lanes are provided on both
sides of the Lake Street S along the project frontage and extending north to downtown and
south towards SR 520 and the City of Bellevue.


Transit Service
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit. The closest transit
stop to the project is approximately one-quarter mile to the east along State Street S at
10th Avenue S. This location is served by Route 230, which provides service from the
Kingsgate Park-and-Ride in Totem Lake to the Redmond Transit Center via downtown
Kirkland and Bellevue. Service is provided on weekdays from approximately 5:00 a.m. to
midnight with 30-minute headways for a majority of the day (including the peak commute
periods) and 60-minute headways in the early morning and late evening. Weekend service is
also provided from approximately 6:00 a.m. to midnight with 60-minute headways.

                                            Project Impacts
This section documents project-generated impacts on the surrounding transportation system
and at the study intersections. First, project peak hour traffic generation is estimated,
distributed, and assigned to the study area. Next, future 2012 traffic volumes with the project
are projected and potential impacts are identified.

Trip Generation
Daily and weekday peak hour trip generation for the proposed Potala development was
estimated based on the land use size and trip rates from the Institute of Transportation
Engineers’ Trip Generation, 8th Edition. This is consistent with City of Kirkland requirements.
The tenants for the commercial portion of the project are unknown. Based on coordination
with the developer, 3,000 square-feet of medical office and 3,186 square-feet of general
office use were assumed.

The proposed development will replace existing uses; therefore, trip generation for the
existing uses was estimated and subtracted from the proposed project traffic generation to
determine the net new project trips. Traffic for the existing uses was estimated based on the
size and the average trip rate from ITE’s Trip Generation. Table 3 summarizes the estimated
trip generation for the proposed development. As shown in the table, the proposed Potala
Village is anticipated to generate approximately 1,070 net new daily trips with 86 trips
occurring during the AM peak hour and 107 trips occurring during the PM peak.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The proposed project distribution was based on information provided by the City of Kirkland
using the City’s travel demand model as well as knowledge of the study area, observed travel
patterns, and traffic calming measures located along 10th Avenue S. Figure 5 summarizes
the distributions patterns. As shown in the figure, approximately 60 percent of the project
traffic would come to and from the north and 40 percent would come to and from the south.
The anticipated net new PM peak hour project trips were assigned to the study intersections
as shown in Figure 6. Project traffic volumes were added to the future baseline traffic
volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. Figure 7 shows the weekday PM peak
hour traffic volumes at the study intersections.

Traffic Operations
An operational analysis was conducted at the study intersections to evaluate the future
(2012) weekday PM peak hour conditions with the project. The results of the with-project
analysis were compared to the baseline analysis to identify the potential project impacts.
Table 4 summarizes the future with and without-project LOS for the weekday PM peak hour.
Detailed LOS worksheets are included in Appendix D.

As discussed previously, the City and WSDOT’s adopted standard is LOS D. Based on the
City’s Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines (February 2004), the City defines a SEPA impact
requiring mitigation at a signalized location where the project’s proportional share of daily
intersection traffic related to the capacity of the intersection represents1:
           More than 15 percent at intersections operating at LOS E
           More than 5 percent at intersections operating at LOS F

Appendix A contains the proportional share calculation worksheets. The project’s proportional
share represents approximately one to three percent at all signalized study locations.

As shown in Table 4, with the addition of project traffic during the weekday PM peak hour, all
the study intersections would continue to have the same LOS as baseline conditions with the
exception of Lake Street S/10th Avenue S, which would operate at LOS D. The 108th Avenue
NE/NE 68th Street and NE 72nd Place/I-405 Southbound Ramp intersections would operate
at LOS E during the PM peak hour under baseline and with-project conditions. In addition, the
116th Avenue NE/I-405 Northbound Ramp intersection would operate at LOS F during the
PM peak hour under baseline and with-project conditions. At the intersections operating at
LOS E or F, the project’s proportional impact2 would be less than two percent, which is less
than the City’s threshold defined for a SEPA impact requiring mitigation.

Transportation Concurrency
A transportation concurrency test was completed for this project by the City of Kirkland on
November 29, 2010. The proposed project passed the concurrency test based on the project
having 164 condominium units and 9,028 square-feet of retail. The current proposal would
construct 143 condominium units and 5,779 square-feet of commercial use, which would
generate less traffic than the previous proposal, and thus, would continue to meet
concurrency. Appendix E contains the transportation concurrency test results. The
concurrency test notice shall expire and a new concurrency test application is required
unless:
          A complete SEPA checklist, traffic impact analysis and all required documentation
           are submitted to the City within 90 calendar days of the concurrency test notice.
          A Certificate of Concurrency is issued or an extension is requested and granted by
           the Public Works Department within one year of issuance of the concurrency test
           notice. (A Certificate of Concurrency is issued at the same time a development permit
           or building permit is issued if the applicant holds a valid concurrency test notice.)
          A Certificate of Concurrency shall expire six years from the date of issuance of the
           concurrency test notice unless all building permits are issued for buildings approved
           under the concurrency test notice.

Site Access Evaluation
The proposed site access driveway would provide full access along Lake Street S with stop
control provided on the driveway approach. This section discusses the proposed site access
operations.

Intersection Operations
Weekday PM peak hour LOS and queuing were reviewed at the site access driveway. Table
5 summarizes the site access operations. As shown in the table, the site access is
anticipated to operate LOS D with Lake Street S operating at LOS A. The queues at the
driveway are anticipated to be minimal during the weekday PM peak hour.

Sight Distance
Sight distance was also evaluated at the project driveway. The City of Kirkland recommends
an entering sight distance of 335-feet at driveways with a PM peak hour volume between 50
and 200 vehicles per hour with access to a major street with an average daily traffic volume
greater than 6,000 vehicles and a posted speed limit of 30 mph. Based on field
measurements using the City of Kirkland procedures, the project site access would have
entering sight distances greater than 400 feet in both directions. However, consistent with the
existing access points along Lake Street/Lake Washington Boulevard, when vehicles are
parked on-street near the proposed driveway, sight distance would be obstructed by the



                                                                                                                       Page 14

parked vehicles. Similar to how the existing access points function along the roadway, drivers
would need to pull forward such that they were positioned approximately 10-feet from the
edge of travel way (instead of 14-feet as outlined in the procedures for measuring sight
distance). By moving up, drivers would be able to see past the parked vehicles and the City’s
entering sight distance recommendations would be met.

Gap Analysis
At the request of the City, data were collected on January 4, 2011 during the weekday PM
peak period to determine the number of available gaps along Lake Street S for traffic entering
and exiting the project site. The data is provided in Appendix B. The necessary gap for
passenger cars making left-turns in and out of the project was determined based on criteria
found in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials’ (AASHTO)
A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 4th Edition (2001). The gap required
for outbound left-turns (exiting) the driveway onto Lake Street S is approximately 7.5 seconds
representing the gap between vehicles in both the northbound and southbound directions
allow the exiting vehicle to traverse the northbound travel lane and entering the traffic stream
in the southbound direction. The gap required for inbound left-turns (entering) the driveway
from Lake Street S is approximately 5.5 seconds representing the gap between vehicles in
the northbound direction allowing a vehicle to traverse the lane and enter the site. Table 6
summarizes the gap analysis for the outbound and inbound left-turn movements.

1.   Based on AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 4th Edition, 2001. The outbound left-turn requires a
     vehicle gap of 7.5 seconds to traverse both the southbound and northbound direction and the inbound left-turn requires a vehicle
     gap of 5.5 seconds to traverse the northbound direction.
2.   The observed gaps is based on data collected on January 4, 2011 for the PM Peak hour (5:00 to 6:00 p.m.).
3.   If the number of observed vehicle gaps along Lake Street S is greater than the total number of left-turns then there are adequate
     gaps to serve the driveway.


Table 6 shows there are sufficient gaps during the PM peak hour to serve the outbound and
inbound left-turns since the number anticipated left-turns is less than the observed gaps in
traffic. As traffic volumes increase in the future, the number of vehicle gaps would decrease.
Based on the future 2012 forecasts, traffic volumes are anticipated to increase by
approximately 20 to 30 percent in the vicinity of the project site. However, if the vehicle gaps
were reduced by as much as 50 percent due to growth in traffic volumes, there would still be
sufficient gaps to accommodate the project traffic.

Parking
The project includes 316 garage parking spaces with 29 parking stalls for commercial use
and 43 parking stalls for visitors. The visitor and commercial parking would not be gated so
that parking can be accessed at all times. This section summarizes the parking demand and
code analysis prepared for the project.

Parking Demand
The anticipated parking demand was calculated based on weekday average rates in ITE’s
Parking Generation, 4th Edition. Residential peak parking demand was based on low/mid-rise
apartment land use (#221) and the commercial demand was based on general office #701
and medical office #720 land uses.

Time of day parking characteristics from ITE were also taken into consideration since parking
could be shared on the first floor of the garage. The apartment land use does not have time
of day information for the period between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.; therefore, the rental
townhouse (#224) land use was used since it is a similar use. Table 7 provides a summary of
the estimated parking demand. As shown in the table, the proposed parking supply would
accommodate the peak parking demand with or without consideration of shared or existing
on-street parking.

1. Weekday average rate for suburban location from ITE’s Parking Generation, 4th Edition.
2. Based on time of day information in ITE’s Parking Generation, 4th Edition, where the peak parking demand for all the uses would
    occur between 12:00 to 4:00 a.m. when all the residential parking would be required and no commercial spaces would be
    needed.



City of Kirkland Parking Code Analysis
As noted previously, the project includes 316 garage parking spaces with 29 parking stalls for
commercial use and 43 stalls for visitors. The City of Kirkland Municipal Code Title 23 Zoning
requires 1.7 spaces per residential unit, up to 0.5 spaces per residential unit for guest
parking, one space per 300 square-feet for office uses, and one space per 200 square-feet
for medical office uses for zone BN. Table 8 provides a summary of the proposed parking
supply compared to parking code.

1. The parking code requires up to 0.5 stalls per unit for visitors. Based on past project, the City has typically required between 0.25
    and 0.5 stalls per unit.


As shown in the table, the proposed parking supply would meet the City’s parking code. The
developer would provide approximately 0.30 spaces per unit for visitor parking, which is
within the range typically required by the City3.

                      Mitigation Measures and Study
                            Recommendations
It is anticipated that in 2012 with the addition of project traffic that existing infrastructure
combined would accommodate the proposed development. The developer would be required
to pay the City of Kirkland transportation impact fees. The impact fee ordinance allows credit
for existing land uses, which are reflected in the calculations in Table 9. The preliminary fee
estimate for the proposed project is $382,500. These fees are provided as estimates only and
will be finalized by the City upon review.

Appendix C:   LOS Definitions
Highway Capacity Manual, 2000

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying
several intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time.
Specifically, LOS criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified
time period (for example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on
many variables, including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the
intersection), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity.
Table 1 shows LOS criteria for signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity
Manual (Transportation Research Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

    Level of        Average Control Delay           General Description
    Service               (sec/veh)                 (Signalized Intersections)
        A                      10                  Free Flow
        B                    >10 - 20               Stable Flow (slight delays)
        C                    >20 - 35               Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                           Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait
                             >35 - 55
                                                    through more than one signal cycle before proceeding)
        E                    >55 - 80               Unstable flow (intolerable delay)
        F                      >80                  Forced flow (jammed)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types:
all-way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS
is expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of
a signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a
two-way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual
movements, rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-
controlled intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total
average vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized
intersections (both all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

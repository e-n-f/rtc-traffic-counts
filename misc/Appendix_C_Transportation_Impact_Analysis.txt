EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In March 19, 2010, the City of Torrance (City) certified the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared
for the Rockefeller Group Professional Center Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2007121119) (the
Certified EIR). The Certified EIR analyzed the development of approximately 351,200 square feet of
medical/office, professional office, and light industrial condominium buildings, to be developed in two
phases (the Approved Project) on a 23.58-acre site (the Project Site) located on the south side of Lomita
Boulevard between Garnier Street and Crenshaw Boulevard in the City.

The project applicant for the Approved Project, Rock-Lomita LLC, intends to sell the Project Site to
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco). Based on current market conditions, Rock-Lomita LLC and
Costco have decided to seek City approval to modify the Approved Project to provide for the
development of a 161,500-square-foot Costco warehouse with a 20-position members-only fueling
station, car wash, tire center, and 75,000 square feet of medical office on the Project Site (the Modified
Project)

This traffic analysis accounts for the changes to the traffic resulting from the proposed modifications to
the Approved Project and for traffic volumes and travel patterns that have changed since the Certified
EIR was completed. Intersection turning movement counts conducted in 2014 show a general reduction
in volume as compared to the 2012 forecast volume scenario documented in the Certified EIR.

This traffic analysis assesses the incremental difference in trips between the Approved Project and the
Modified Project. This analysis accounts for changes in travel patterns associated with redistributing
trips from the existing Costco site to the Project Site, and for impacts of trips that could be generated if
another discount club occupies the existing Costco warehouse.

This analysis assumes all trips associated with the Approved Project are included in the Modified
Project’s cumulative volume scenario and that all proportional share contributions will be fulfilled for
mitigations identified in the Certified EIR. In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), the cumulative without project (Cumulative) scenario operations are compared to cumulative
plus project conditions to identify whether the proposed modifications to the development program
result in any new significant environmental impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of impacts
set forth in the Certified EIR.

The findings of this traffic analysis include:

         The potential re-use of the existing Costco building will result in a net reduction of trips on
          Skypark Drive.
         Relative to the trips estimated for the Approved Project, the Modified Project will result in a net
          decrease in estimated trips during the weekday a.m. peak period, reflecting Costco’s hours of
          business.

                                                                                                         July 2014


         Intersections that experience a significant impact during the weekday p.m. peak hour are
          identified in Table 1. The Modified Project shows an impact at five intersections; the Certified
          EIR identified each of these intersections as significantly impacted by the Approved Project
          during the weekday p.m. peak hour.
         The severity of the impacts set forth in the Certified EIR will be exceeded by the Modified
          Project at five intersections; however, no additional mitigations are necessary, other than those
          in the Certified EIR, to mitigate the impacts of the Modified Project back to the level of impact
          identified in the Certified EIR.
         The access control and location for the main entrance to the new Costco site is consistent with
          the Certified EIR assumptions, identifying the need for a new traffic signal on Lomita Boulevard.
          Secondary access is proposed from the existing full access along the western property boundary
          and a proposed right-in, right-out access located east of the fueling station.
         The proposed Costco layout can meet access, delivery, and internal parking and circulation
          needs of the Costco.

PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Certified EIR analyzed the development of the Approved Project, which consisted of approximately
351,200 square feet of medical/office, professional office, and light industrial condominium buildings.
The Approved Project would be developed in two phases on the 23.58-acre Project Site, located on the
south side of Lomita Boulevard between Garnier Street and Crenshaw Boulevard in the City. A site
vicinity map is included as Figure 1.

The project applicant for the Approved Project, Rock-Lomita LLC, intends to sell the Project Site to
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco). Based on current market conditions, the Rock-Lomita LLC and
Costco have decided to seek City approval to modify the Approved Project as described below in order
to accommodate a Costco that will move from a location on an adjacent offsite parcel.


Approved Project
The Approved Project consists of the development of approximately 351,200 square feet of medical
office, professional office and light industrial condominium building pads, to be developed in two
phases. Phase I of the Approved Project would include three medical office buildings with a floor area
of approximately 66,200 square feet, seven professional office buildings with a floor area of
approximately 99,790 square feet, and one light industrial building with a floor area of approximately
44,200 square feet. Access ways, parking areas, trash enclosures, bike racks, and outdoor seating areas
would also be provided. Phase I was anticipated to be completed in 2010.

Phase II of the Approved Project would include three medical office buildings with a floor area of
approximately 62,850 square feet, three professional office buildings with a floor area of approximately
40,150 square feet, and a light industrial building with a floor area of approximately 38,030 square feet
(Figure 2.3-3). Phase II was anticipated to be completed in 2012.

Vehicular access to the Project Site would be provided off of Lomita Boulevard at a new signalized
entry. Vehicular access to the buildings would be provided from shared driveways.


Modified Project
Rock-Lomita LLC and Costco propose to modify the Approved Project to provide for the development of
a 161,500 square-foot Costco warehouse with a 20-position members-only fueling station, a tire center
car wash, and 75,000 square feet of medical office on the Project Site. Costco would vacate their
148,000-square-foot existing warehouse adjacent to the Project Site, which would be repurposed for
future shopping center use. The Project site plan for the Modified Project is shown in Figure 2. The
Costco warehouse and fueling station would employ approximately 200 to 250 people.

Similar to the Approved Project, the Modified Project would be constructed in two phases. Phase I
would include construction of the 161,500 square-foot Costco warehouse, together with a tire center,
car wash, and fueling station on an approximate 17.48-acre portion of the Project Site. Phase I would
commence mid-2015 and require approximately 8 months to complete. Phase II would include
development of 75,000 square feet of medical uses on the remaining 6.1 acres. This phase would
commence in 2016 and require approximately 12 months to complete. Build out of the Modified
Project could be completed in the same year.

and private label merchandise for commercial and personal use. The warehouse hours are anticipated
to be: Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and
Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Delivery hours will generally occur between 3:00 a.m. and 2:30
p.m.

Primary access to the Project Site will be provided by a new signalized access onto Lomita Boulevard, as
envisioned in the Approved Project. Additional access will be provided by an access easement to the
adjacent existing Costco parking lot to the south, providing vehicle access to Skypark Drive. In addition,
a right-in, right-out access is proposed east of the fueling station. This eastern access will reduce
demands on the traffic signal and provide a convenient route for exiting trucks.

Like the Approved Project, the Modified Project includes 75,000 square feet of medical office in the
northwest corner of the property. This will be Phase II of the Modified Project. The proposed layout is
almost identical to the Approved Project in that it includes three two-story medical office buildings
setback approximately 120 feet from Lomita Boulevard. These buildings will be on a separate parcel
from the Costco warehouse and fueling station parcels.

Regional access to the site is provided by Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) approximately three-quarters of a
mile south of the project site, Interstate 110 (I-110) approximately three miles east of the Project Site,
and Interstate 405 (I-405) approximately four miles north of the project site. Major arterials within the
study area include Hawthorne Boulevard (SR 107), Crenshaw Boulevard, Sepulveda Boulevard, Torrance
Boulevard, and Lomita Boulevard.

INTRODUCTION
Costco is planning to relocate the existing Costco warehouse and fueling station operations on Skypark
Drive to new facilities on the undeveloped lot located immediately north. The existing building and
fueling station will be vacated, and the new site will provide an improved parking layout, slightly larger
Costco warehouse, a new car wash, and a new fueling station. The relocation will focus the primary
Costco access onto Lomita Boulevard at a new traffic signal.

The transportation impacts associated with relocation of an existing Costco are less than those
associated with developing vacant land with a new Costco for several reasons, including:

         The Project Site has been previously approved for development; therefore, this analysis reflects
          the incremental difference between Approved Project and Modified Project trips.
         Costco has documented that its stores generate more trips than similar discount clubs;
          therefore, the analysis at the existing warehouse accounts for a net reduction in trips associated
          with closing the Costco and opening a future discount club.


SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This traffic analysis assesses the incremental difference in trips between the Approved Project and the
Modified Project. This analysis accounts for changes in travel patterns associated with redistributing
trips from the existing Costco site to the project site, and for impacts of trips that could be generated if
another discount club occupies the existing warehouse.

This traffic analysis accounts for traffic volumes and travel patterns that have changed since the
Certified EIR was completed. Intersection turning movement counts conducted in 2014 show a general
reduction in volumes compared to the 2012 forecast volume scenario documented in the Certified EIR.

The analysis assumes all trips associated with the Approved Project are included in the Modified
Project’s cumulative volume scenario and that all proportional share contributions will be fulfilled for
mitigations identified in the Certified EIR. In accordance with CEQA, the cumulative (without project)
scenario operations are compared to cumulative plus project conditions to identify whether the
proposed modifications to the development program result in any new significant environmental
impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of impacts set forth in the Certified EIR.

KAI performed operational analysis during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours at all intersections
studied in the Certified EIR, plus driveways to the existing Costco. The study intersections and existing
intersection traffic control are summarized in Table 2.

This report summarizes the analysis in the following order:

              Year 2014 existing land-use and transportation-system conditions within the site vicinity
               during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours;

LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA AND SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLDS
The level-of-service (LOS) analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the
Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) methodology and in conformance with the procedures contained
in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Both methodologies were analyzed using Synchro
analysis software. Synchro ICU results were compared to the Table 2 ICU LOS criteria in accordance with
agency requirements. Each jurisdiction’s intersections were analyzed in accordance to their
performance standards identified in the Certified EIR to provide a direct comparison. Table 3 includes
the significance criteria for ICU LOS and Table 4 defines the significance criteria for HCM delay
methodology.

Table 3. ICU Methodology LOS Criteria
 ICU LOS Significance Criteria
    A       If ICU is less than or equal to 60%
    B       If ICU is greater than 60%, and less than or equal to 70%
    C       If ICU is greater than 70%, and less than or equal to 80%
    D       If ICU is greater than 80%, and less than or equal to 90%
     E      If ICU is greater than 90%, and less than or equal to 100%
      *
    F       If ICU is greater than 100%
*
    Intersection is over capacity and likely experiences congestion periods of 15 to 60 consecutive minutes

In general terms, intersection LOS is analogous to the letter grades in a school report card. Motorists
using an intersection that operates at LOS “A” experience very little delay, while those using an
intersection that operates at LOS “F” will experience congested conditions. The use of the ICU and HCM
results provide an understanding of motorist delay and the physical ability of the intersection to
accommodate demand volume.

Table 4. HCM Delay Methodology LOS Criteria
      Level of
      Service           Average Delay per Vehicle
                        Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is
           A            extremely favorable, and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop
                        at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
                        Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20
           B            seconds per vehicle. This generally occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths.
                        More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of average delay.
                        Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35
                        seconds per vehicle. These higher delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle
           C            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number of vehicles
                        stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without
                        stopping.
                        Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55
                        seconds per vehicle. The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
           D            result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle length, or high
                        volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping
                        declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.
                        Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80
                        seconds per vehicle. This is usually considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high
           E
                        delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high
                        volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                        Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be
                        unacceptable to most drivers. This condition often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur
           F            at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression
                        and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values, even when the
                        volume/capacity ratio is significantly below 1.0.

Table 5 summarizes the traffic impact analyses methodology and LOS significance thresholds for each
jurisdiction in the study area. Each City within the study area utilizes the ICU methodology for
identifying whether a project creates a significant effect on the transportation system. The City of
Torrance, within which the proposed project will reside, also uses the HCM delay methodology.
Caltrans uses the HCM delay methodology for analyzing project impacts on state facilities.

Six intersections identified within the study area are classified as arterial monitoring intersections in the
Los Angeles Congestion Management Program (CMP). In accordance with the CMP, intersections that
meet the following criteria must be evaluated:

     1) All CMP arterial monitoring intersections, including monitored freeway on- or off-ramp
        intersections, where the proposed project will add 50 or more trips during either the weekday
        a.m. or p.m. peak hours (of adjacent street traffic).
     2) Mainline freeway monitoring locations, where the project will add 150 or more trips in either
        direction during the weekday a.m. or p.m. peak hours.

Each of the six CMP intersections within the study area met the requirements for a CMP analysis within
the Certified EIR; to provide a consistent assessment of the incremental Costco impacts, a CMP analysis

has been prepared regardless of whether these thresholds were triggered with the Modified Project
trips. The Modified Project adds less than 150 trips to any freeway mainline segment; therefore, an
analysis of project impacts to CMP mainline freeway locations was not required as part of the Certified
EIR and is not required with the lesser impacts from the Modified Project.

This study collected manual turning movement counts in January 2014 at each of the study
intersections to examine the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour service levels. This information is also
used as a basis for future volume projections. The method used for analyzing existing conditions is to
apply the LOS calculation procedures using the observed peak hour intersection counts and summarize
the resulting existing operations for each study intersection. Cumulative and cumulative plus project
2016 traffic forecasts and LOS are then calculated without and with the proposed project, and
intersection locations impacted by the project are identified.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.

Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried the Project Site and surrounding study
intersections in February 2014. At that time, KAI collected information regarding site conditions,
adjacent land uses, existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in the study area.


SITE CONDITIONS AND ADJACENT LAND USES
The Project Site is within the City of Torrance, is currently undeveloped and zoned for mixed-
commercial use. The site is approved for medical and general office uses. Surrounding uses include bulk
fuel storage to the north, Sam’s Club and other retail uses to the east, and a church to the west. Other
major land uses located nearby include the Torrance Memorial Medical Center farther west, and the
Torrance Airport to the south of Skypark Drive. Land surrounding the Project Site is largely built out,
with residential beyond the industrial, retail, and office uses.


TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Characteristics of major roadways within the study area are summarized in Table 6.

Roadway Facilities
As shown in Figure 1, Lomita Boulevard is the only public roadway bordering the project site. The City of
Torrance classifies Lomita Boulevard as a Major Arterial adjacent to the project site, where it contains a
four-lane roadway trending in the east-west direction with sidewalks and bicycle lanes on both sides of
the street.

The characteristics of the study roadway system within the City of Torrance are described below:

Crenshaw Boulevard is a north-south six-lane divided roadway with a continuous two-way left-turn
lane within the project’s vicinity. However, beyond the project’s vicinity, Crenshaw Boulevard varies
from a four- to six-lane roadway with a raised median running in a north-south direction. On-street
parking is prohibited along Crenshaw Boulevard. Crenshaw Boulevard provides access to and from
Interstate 405 to the north and Pacific Coast highway to the south.

Skypark Drive is directly south of the project site, trending in the east-west direction. The project site
plan includes access from Lomita Boulevard to Skypark Drive. Skypark Drive is a four-lane divided
roadway with a continuous two-way left-turn lane. Skypark Drive currently provides access to the
existing Costco. On-street parking is prohibited along Skypark Drive.

Torrance Boulevard is a four-lane divided roadway with a continuous two-way left-turn lane running in
the east-west direction approximately two miles north of the project site. Torrance Boulevard provides
access from Interstate 110 to the east and from the coastal communities to the west. There is no
parking on Torrance Boulevard within the site vicinity.


Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Field observations taken in the site vicinity revealed low levels of pedestrian and bicycle activity along
the study area roadways. However, Lomita Boulevard is one of the few study roadways that provides
sidewalks on both sides of the street and bike lanes in both directions. The proposed Torrance Costco
relocation will continue to provide both pedestrian and bicycle access to the site.


Transit Facilities
Local transit service is provided throughout the project vicinity by Torrance Transit. In addition to fixed-
route service which is provided seven days a week, Torrance Transit provides dial-a-ride services as
well. Monthly transit passes are available for $35 or a base fare of $1.00 for each ride. Reduced rates
are available for the disabled, seniors, and students. The project site will be accessible via Torrance
Transit Route 9. Route 9 travels along Lomita Boulevard from Avalon Boulevard in the east to Anza
Avenue in the west, before heading up Anza Avenue to Del Amo Fashion Center.

Nearby transit stops are located to the west at the signalized Lomita Boulevard/Garnier intersection,
and to the east near the signalized intersection with Crenshaw Boulevard. Pedestrian pushbuttons and
crossings are provided at the traffic signals.

TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
Manual turning-movement counts were obtained for the all the existing study intersections on
Thursday, January 9, 2014. All the counts used in this analysis were conducted on a typical mid-week
day during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak time periods. The
individual intersection peak hours were assessed in all analysis scenarios. Figure 3 provides an
illustration of each intersection existing configuration and identifies the existing traffic control devices.
Appendix “A” contains the traffic count worksheets at all intersections used in this study.


Existing Levels of Service
There were a total of 44 intersections analyzed in the study area. Operational analysis of the 40
signalized intersections was based on HCM and ICU methodologies, consistent with jurisdictional
requirements. For the remaining four stop-controlled locations studied, the average delay experienced
by the stop-controlled leg was assessed only with the HCM delay methodology. A summary of the year
2014 turning-movement counts for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours are illustrated in Figures 4
and 5.

The existing conditions ICU values and LOS for the signalized and unsignalized intersections are
summarized in Table 7. As Table 7 indicates, 6 signalized intersections are currently operating at LOS
“E” or LOS “F” during the weekday a.m. peak hour and 12 signalized intersections are operating LOS “E”
or LOS “F” in the p.m. peak hour.

In addition to using the ICU methodology for determining intersection level of service at signalized
intersections, the City of Torrance also utilizes the HCM delay methodology, which calculates the
average delay in seconds per vehicle at each intersection. Caltrans relies solely on HCM delay analysis
to determine project impacts. Table 7 also summarizes the existing intersection levels of service for
intersections controlled by the City of Torrance or Caltrans based on HCM delay methodology. Appendix
“B” includes the level-of-service worksheets under year 2014 existing traffic conditions.

PROJECT IMPACT ANALYSIS
The transportation impact analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system will operate in
the year the proposed development is expected to be fully built, year 2016. The impact of traffic
generated by the Modified Project during the typical weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours was examined
as follows:

2016 Cumulative Traffic Conditions
              Developments and transportation improvements planned in the study area were identified.
              Cumulative traffic volume scenario was developed based on:
                     o Applying 1.0-percent annual growth to the existing traffic volumes to account for
                       regional growth in the site vicinity between years 2014 and 2016 based on regional
                       plans, and
                     o Site-generated trips associated with the Approved Project and other related projects
                       in the study vicinity.
              Cumulative weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic conditions for 2016 (build-out year of
               the Modified Project) were analyzed at the study intersections during the weekday a.m. and
               p.m. peak hours.
Cumulative Plus Project Conditions:

              Subtracted trips from the existing Costco and fuel center on Skypark Drive from the study
               intersection turning movement volumes
              Added trips generated with the repurposing of the existing Costco site to a generic Discount
               Warehouse use.
              Subtracted site-generated trips associated with the Approved Project.
              Added site-generated trips estimated for build-out of the Modified Project.
Based on this methodology, year 2016 cumulative plus project traffic conditions were analyzed at each
of the study intersections and site-access points during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. In
addition, the findings and recommendations of the transportation analysis was coordinated within the
project team to ensure safe and efficient access and circulation would be supported within the site
layout.


YEAR 2016 CUMULATIVE (NO-BUILD) TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The purpose of the year 2016 cumulative traffic analysis is 1) to provide the City of Torrance with a
planning-level analysis of the study area, and 2) to form a basis for comparison to “plus project”
conditions. This analysis does not include the Modified Project, but does include the existing Costco
Warehouse and Fuel center on Skypark Drive and the Approved Project. It is assumed that Costco will

conditions of approval.


Planned Developments and Transportation Improvements
Information on the planned developments affecting the study area intersections were provided by City
of Torrance staff and are summarized in Table 8. Trips were assigned to the study intersections based
on the available information contained within the respective Transportation Impact Analyses, as
available. There were no programmed transportation improvements identified within the project
vicinity. Appendix “C” includes supporting information describing the traffic volumes associated with the
developments in Table 8.

Year 2016 Cumulative Operations
The existing year 2014 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes, as shown in
Figures 4 and 5, were increased with the application of 1 percent annual growth (based on City of
Torrance long range plans and staff direction) to reflect anticipated regional growth in the area, and the
inclusion of the previously approved and pending projects shown in Table 8. These resulting traffic
volumes, as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, were used to conduct an operational analysis at each study
intersection to determine the year 2016 cumulative traffic operations. None of the improvements
identified within the Certified EIR were assumed to be in place as part of this analysis. Appendix “D”
contains the year 2016 cumulative traffic level-of-service worksheets.

MODIFIED PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PLAN
The Applicant proposes to modify the Approved Project to provide for the development of a 161,500
square-foot Costco warehouse with a car wash, 20-position fueling station, tire center and 75,000
square feet of medical office on the Project Site. Costco would vacate their 148,000-square-foot
existing warehouse adjacent to the Project Site; this existing warehouse would be repurposed for future
retail use. The site plan for the Modified Project is shown in Figure 2. The Costco warehouse, tire
center, car wash, and fueling station would employ approximately 200 to 250 people.

Similar to the Approved Project, the Modified Project would be constructed in two phases. Phase I
would include construction of the 161,500 square-foot Costco warehouse, together with a tire center
and fueling station on an approximate 17.48-acre portion of the Project Site. The entire Project Site
would be graded as part of Phase I and would require approximately 60,000 cubic yards of soil import
and include over excavation and re-compaction of building pad areas.


Trip Generation
Trip generation at the existing Costco and the project site was calculated to account for changes
associated with the relocation. As shown in Exhibit 1, analysis of the changes at the Project Site reflect
the addition of the proposed Costco and fueling center, credit for the previously approved office uses
(included within the cumulative analysis), and addition of retained Medical Office. As shown in Exhibit
2, analysis of changes on the existing Costco site accounts for the closure of the Costco and future
repurposing of the vacated building shell. The combined number of new trips on the network is
calculated as shown in Exhibit 3.

As this proposal affects two separate parcels, all trips for the elements identified in Exhibits 1 and 2
were individually assigned to the transportation network to accurately reflect the difference in access
locations between the existing and project site and the separate trip distribution patterns of the office
and Costco uses.

Based on this methodology, the proposed trip generation estimates are summarized in Table 9. As
shown, the regional impacts include an increase in daily trips, a decrease in morning commute period
trips, and a small increase in trips during the evening commute period reflecting the shift from the
approved office uses to the Costco. The reduction in morning commute period trips reflect the limited
amount of trips to and from the warehouse associated only with the fuel center and employee/delivery
trips.

As summarized in Table 9, the existing Costco site will see a decrease in trips onto Skypark Drive,
whereas the Project Site will see an increase in trips accessing onto Lomita Boulevard. The impact of the
changes are somewhat lessened by the connectivity that exists between Skypark Drive and Lomita
Boulevard along the western property boundary. The following sections provide additional information
on each of the components of the trip generation estimate.

Proposed Costco
While ITE data is available for a Discount Club land use, this data does not accurately reflect the specific
characteristics of the proposed Costco and fueling center. KAI has maintained records of Costco trip
generation studies conducted nationally and in compliance with the ITE Trip Generation methodology
that better describes Costco trips and trip characteristics. This database generally shows the ITE
methodology underestimates Costco trips, but many of the Costco trips are not new trips onto the
system. Application of this use-specific data to the existing warehouse and the project site ensures an
accurate assessment of trip generation from the Costco sites.

The applied trip generation rates include the fuel station and tire center as part of the calculated trip
rate. In addition to the driveway trip rates, a pass-by trip reduction of 34-percent and 35-percent is
applied during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively. These percentages are based on customer
survey information.

Like the Costco Gasoline fuel stations, the Costco car wash is for members only and requires a Costco
membership card for use. The car wash is typically staffed by two attendants who are trained to
manage the circulation of cars both entering and exiting the car wash facility.

Trip generation data for Costco car washes was obtained from two locations (Seattle, Washington and
Poway, California) where Costco has a car wash facility adjacent to a warehouse operating for a base
period of time. At both sites, a month of transaction data was obtained that indicates the percentage of
car wash trips that frequent the fuel station and/or the warehouse during their visit (i.e., the
percentage of car wash trips internal to the site). The data indicates that an average of 55 vehicles were
served at the car wash during the average weekday p.m. peak hour, but 80 percent (over 40 trips) were
trips whose primary purpose was to visit the Costco warehouse. Additional details on Costco trip
generation characteristics are provided in Appendix “E.”


Proposed Medical Office
Development of the proposed Costco warehouse, fuel center, and associated parking will comprise
approximately 17.4 acres of the 23.6 acre property, preserving 6.19 acres for office or medical office
uses in the northwest corner of the site, as shown in Exhibit 2. Plans for this area show these buildings
could accommodate up to 75,000 square-feet of office or medical office space in two-story buildings.
This reflects a significant reduction in office space from the Certified EIR for the site, which assumed
over 350,000 square-feet of office space within the overall site. The analysis presented herein assumes
all of this office space is developed as the more trip-intensive medical office use.

Repurposing of Existing Costco
Relocation of Costco’s operations from its existing location to new facilities on the Project Site will
change traffic volumes that are currently on the transportation system. Prior to the opening of the new
Costco, the existing Costco will be closed. The existing building will not be demolished and may be
leased to other warehouse or retail tenants. Based on direction from City of Torrance staff, it was

                                                       32                               Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

assumed that a Discount Club would occupy the existing building. Trip generation estimates for the
Discount Club are based on ITE Trip Generation estimates, and distribution patterns for this use were
assumed to reflect the Costco distribution information and would be equally applicable for a more
generalized Discount Club use. As ITE does not include customer survey data on pass-by trips, no
reductions were applied to the Discount Club land use. Based on direction from City staff, it was
conservatively assumed all trips with this repurposed building are new to the transportation system.
This reflects a higher overall trip rate than other available ITE categories, such as the more general
Shopping Center land use.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION
To properly account for the changes in traffic volumes in the immediate site vicinity, trips associated
with all of the components summarized above were individually distributed onto the transportation
system and assigned throughout the study area intersections, as summarized below.

Two separate trip distribution patterns were developed to account for the Costco and the medical
office. The medical office distribution patterns were based directly on the Certified EIR. This distribution
is shown in Exhibit 4, and highlights where inbound and outbound trips are traveling to and from. This
distribution pattern was applied to the general and medical office uses.

The Costco trip distribution patterns reflect membership records from the existing Costco warehouse.
The modified trip distribution pattern is expected to approximate a realistic travel shed and accurately
reflect the specific turning needs at the site entrances. The trip distribution patterns for both the

YEAR 2016 CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The cumulative plus project traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area’s transportation
system will operate in 2016 with development and occupancy of the Project Site and the changes to the
existing Costco site.

The Year 2016 Cumulative traffic volumes during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours were added
with the site generated trips, as shown in Table 9. As this analysis assumes the approval conditions of
the Approved Project, the Cumulative traffic volumes include Approved Project trips. As such, the
Modified Project will provide the prior mitigation measures and the Approved Project and assesses
whether additional significant impacts occur with the Proposed Project at any of the study area
intersections. In some cases, the number of Approved Project trips is greater than the number of trips
generated by the Modified Project, as indicated by a net decrease in the 2016 cumulative plus project
scenario turning movement volumes.

The resultant volumes were used to conduct an operational analysis at each study intersection to
determine the year 2016 cumulative plus project traffic levels of service, as shown in Figures 9 and 10.
Tables 9 and 10 summarize the results of both the Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project analysis for
the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Appendix “F” contains Project Impact Analysis Summary Tables
that compare existing, 2016 Cumulative, and 2016 Cumulative Plus Project traffic conditions. Appendix
“G” contains the year 2016 cumulative plus project traffic level-of-service worksheets.

    For unsignalized intersections, LOS is based on the critical (highest delay) stop-controlled approach.

Summary of Results
Table 10 shows that during the weekday a.m. peak hour no additional intersections experience a
significant impact. As previously discussed, the Modified Project generally reduces trips during the
morning hours because of Costco’s later opening time than what was estimated for office and medical
Office uses within the Approved Project. In addition, traffic volumes on the system in 2014 are lower
than those that were previously forecast for 2012 in the Approved EIR.

Table 11 summarizes the operations during the weekday p.m. peak hour. This table shows that five
intersections experience a significant impact with the Modified Project. All of these intersections were
previously identified as significantly impacted as part of the Certified EIR. Accordingly, further review
was conducted to identify whether the mitigation measures identified in the Certified EIR remain
adequate to mitigate this higher level of impact, or if additional mitigation measures would be
necessary.

TRANSPORTATION MITIGATION MEASURES

SUMMARY OF OFF-SITE INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS
A summary of the operational analysis findings is presented below:

         The Modified Project does not impact any of the study intersections during the weekday a.m.
          peak hour, owing to the reduction in trips compared to those from the Approved Project.
         A total of 22 intersections were significantly impacted by the Approved Project, and
          improvements were identified to mitigate the impacts in Table 4-1 of the Certified EIR.
         The Cumulative Plus Project analysis for the Modified Project shows a significant impact at five
          intersections during the weekday p.m. peak hour. All five intersections were significantly
          impacted by the Approved Project. These intersections, mitigation measures, and adequacy of
          the mitigation measures are summarized in Tables 12 and 13.
         The severity of the impacts set forth in the Certified EIR will be exceeded by the Modified
          Project; however, no additional mitigations are necessary, other than those in the Certified EIR,
          to mitigate the impacts of the Modified Project back to the level of impact identified in the
          Certified EIR.
         While the improvement needs do not change, variances in trip generation and distribution
          patterns (along with modifications to projected traffic) alters the proportionate impact of the
          Modified Project from those of the Approved Project. Pro-rata shares at each of the
          significantly-impacted intersections will be determined based on these revised projections
          through discussions with the City of Torrance.
         Tables 12 and 13 summarize the intersection mitigations identified within the Certified EIR for
          the Approved Project and the updated analysis results for the Modified Project.

As shown in Tables 13 and 14, feasible mitigations previously identified in the Certified EIR address
impacts at four of the five intersections impacted by the Modified Project. At the Narbonne Avenue and
Lomita Boulevard intersection, identified mitigations included the addition of a second northbound
through lane and a third eastbound through lane. These improvements were not considered feasible as
it would require the acquisition of additional right-of-way and demolition of existing buildings.
Accordingly, the Modified Project does not change the original findings or recommendations at any of
the off-site study intersections from those identified in the Certified EIR.

The City of Torrance Development Impact Fee (DIF) and pro rata shares of mitigations will be discussed
with the City of Torrance, in accordance with jurisdiction requirements. Mitigated Level of Service
Worksheets are included in Appendix “H.”


SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

Site Access
As shown in the site plan, there are three accesses proposed onto Lomita Boulevard and access is
available along the western property boundary south to Skypark Drive. The central site intersection is
designed to serve as the primary entrance, and is proposed to include three outbound lanes and two
inbound lanes at a new signalized “T” intersection. Design of this intersection will include dual
northbound (outbound) left-turn lanes and a single right-turn lane. Pedestrian accommodations are
proposed for all approaches.

To accommodate right-turn maneuvers at the traffic signal, a right-turn lane with overlap signal phasing
(and restricted westbound U-turns) is proposed. This design will allow outbound vehicles turning right
to turn during the red phase and while the westbound left-turn signal is green. With this configuration
the intersection will adequately serve Costco demands during the peak weekday and weekend periods.
Intersection queue storage is provided to serve 95th percentile queues forecast during the weekday
p.m. peak period. Queuing Analysis Worksheets are included in Appendix “I.”

Minor modifications are proposed to the existing westernmost full-access unsignalized entrance onto
Lomita Boulevard. This will include a striped three-lane cross-section providing a separate northbound
right- and left-turn lane. It is expected that the intersection will benefit from the gaps in the traffic flow
from the adjacent signal, but northbound motorists turning left during the peak periods will largely
utilize the new signal. The provision of separate left- and right-turn lanes will allow right-turning
vehicles to bypass the left-turn queue.

East of the fueling center a right-in, right-out is proposed. This connection will help to offload the
demands at the new traffic signal serving the heavier eastbound movements. Channelization at the
access will restrict the driveway to right-in, right-out maneuvers. Provision of this access will also help
to relieve the demands at the internal all-way stop-controlled intersection.

Internal Site Circulation
Internal circulation was evaluated to ensure that the site provides sufficient on-site circulation for
pedestrian movements and internal traffic. The Costco warehouse, car wash, tire center, and fueling
station layout were coordinated with the overall project team to accomplish the following:

         Discourage vehicular travel near the Costco entrance to limit pedestrian and vehicular conflicts
          to those that are loading large merchandise.
         Align drive aisles throughout the parking area and design intersections with perpendicular
          approach angles.
         Extend the driveway throat depth at all accesses to meet the queuing needs and adequately
          disperse entering and exiting traffic.
         Provide pedestrian pathways wide enough to accommodate shopping carts and hand trucks
          from periphery parking areas to the front door of the warehouse.
         Design the Costco warehouse loading bays with adequate maneuver space for the WB67 trucks
          that serve the site.
         Maximize queue storage at the fueling center and provide a site layout that can accommodate
          fuel deliveries to the tanks during hours of operation with minimal conflict to the fueling
          operations.
         Provide cart returns throughout the parking area to encourage use of the cart corrals.

The Costco site plan incorporates the concepts shown above while balancing connectivity, access,
landscaping, utility, and drainage needs. The site has been designed to accommodate typical peak
parking demands both on weekdays and weekends.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of the traffic impact analysis indicate that with incorporation of the access
recommendations as shown in the attached site plan, the development of the Modified Project will not
result in any new or substantially increased significant impacts beyond those disclosed in the Certified
EIR for the Approved Project. Additional details on the findings and recommendations are presented
below.

The analysis assumes all trips associated with the Approved Project are included in the Modified
Project’s cumulative volume scenario and that all proportional share contributions will be fulfilled for
mitigations identified in the Certified EIR. In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), the cumulative scenario operations are compared to cumulative plus project conditions to
identify whether the proposed modifications to the development program result in any new significant
environmental impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of impacts set forth in the Certified EIR.

This traffic analysis accounts for the changes to the traffic resulting from the proposed modifications to
the Approved Project and for traffic volumes and travel patterns that have changed since the Certified
EIR was completed. This traffic analysis assesses the incremental difference in trips between the
Approved Project and the Modified Project.

This analysis assumes all trips associated with the Approved Project are included in the Modified
Project’s cumulative volume scenario and that all proportional share contributions will be fulfilled for
mitigations identified in the Certified EIR. In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), the cumulative without project (Cumulative) scenario operations are compared to cumulative
plus project conditions to identify whether the proposed modifications to the development program
result in any new significant environmental impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of impacts
set forth in the Certified EIR.

This study concludes that the severity of the impacts set forth in the Certified EIR will be exceeded by
the Modified Project at five intersections; however, no additional mitigations are necessary, other than
those in the Certified EIR, to mitigate the impacts of the Modified Project back to the level of impact
identified in the Certified EIR.

                                                                                                          July 2014



FINDINGS

Year 2014 Existing Conditions
         Frontage improvements are in place along Lomita Boulevard including bicycle lanes and
          sidewalks. Transit service is present along Lomita Boulevard.
         New traffic counts were obtained in January 2014 at all 44 study intersections; existing 2014
          traffic volumes are generally lower than those projected for 2012 in the Certified EIR.
         The existing Costco site and proposed relocation site are linked by a drive aisle connection along
          the western property boundaries.


Year 2016 Cumulative Traffic Conditions
         Year 2016 cumulative traffic conditions include trips from approved and pending land use
          applications identified by City of Torrance staff as well as an adjustment for ambient growth.
          The cumulative analysis includes the Approved Project trips on the relocation site.


Proposed Development Plan
         The new Costco facilities will include a larger warehouse with a car wash, 20-position fueling
          station, and some remaining land that could accommodate approximately 75,000 square-feet of
          office or medical office uses in two-story buildings. The relocation would include the closure of
          the adjacent Costco site, with the potential repurposing of the building.
         Primary access to the new Costco site would be at a new signalized intersection on Lomita
          Boulevard. A new right-in, right-out access is proposed east of the fuel center, and the Project
          Site will have access to the existing connection between Lomita Boulevard and Skypark Drive
          along the western property boundary.
         Trips from the Costco were estimated based on the potential changes to both affected parcels.
          This includes closure of the existing Costco and repurposing of the building shell, addition of the
          new Costco, and development of up to 75,000 square-feet of medical office uses. The net
          change to the system is a decrease of 394 trips during the weekday a.m. peak hour and the
          addition of 61 trips during the weekday p.m. peak hour. The varying in and out splits, changes in
          distribution patterns, and routing between the parcels was accounted for within the analysis.


Year 2016 Cumulative Plus Project Traffic Conditions
         All 44 off-site intersections assessed in the Certified EIR were reviewed. This showed that five of
          the 22 intersections previously identified with a significant impact will continue to show a
          significant impact with the revised traffic volumes, Approved Project traffic, and growth factors.
         At the five significantly-affected intersections, the same recommendations previously identified
          in the Certified EIR will continue to be adequate to mitigate the impact of the Modified Project,
          with the exception of one intersection for which the Certified EIR found no feasible mitigation.

                                                                                                          July 2014


          As with the Approved Project, the impact of the Modified Project would be significant and
          unavoidable.
         The Modified Project will not create impacts to the pedestrian, bicycle, or transit systems in the
          area. Planned connectivity between the site and the multimodal infrastructure along Lomita
          Boulevard will further promote these travel options.

On-Site Circulation/Site Access Operations
         The proposed access locations and sizing shown within the project site plan has been designed
          to accommodate traffic demands from the Costco, car wash, fuel center, and office uses.
         Truck routes and circulation have been reviewed for the Costco, car wash, and fuel center and
          can be accommodated within the site.
         Pedestrian walkways shown in the site plan connect the parking areas to the building entrance,
          and the Costco to the adjacent office buildings.


RECOMMENDATIONS
The following list summarizes the transportation mitigation measures recommended as part of
Modified Project.

         Previously identified mitigation measures from the Approved EIR and subsequent approval
          conditions will be required.
         Costco should contribute its Development Impact Fee for additional impacts from the Modified
          Project to the City of Torrance based on City policy.
         Pro rata shares of mitigations should be developed with the City of Torrance and other affected
          agencies in accordance with jurisdictional requirements for additional impacts from the
          Modified Project.
         A new traffic signal should be constructed at the main entrance. The traffic signal should include
          dual northbound left-turn lanes, a separate northbound right-turn lane with overlap signal
          phasing, and restriction of the westbound U-turn. Additional design details should be
          coordinated with City of Torrance staff within the design process.
         The unsignalized western access should be restriped to include a separate northbound left- and
          right-turn lane.
         A new right-in, right-out access should be constructed east of the proposed fueling station. This
          should include a raised median to enforce the movement restriction.
         Monument signs, utilities, and landscaping should be located outside of the sight-distance
          triangles to maintain a clear view of oncoming vehicles at the site access points and at internal
          intersections.

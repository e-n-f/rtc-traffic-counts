INTRODUCTION 
 


Washington  Metropolitan  Airports  Authority  (WMAA)/  Project  Management  Support  Services 
(PMSS)  initiated  this  study  to  serve  as  a  supplement  to  the  September  8,  2011  report  titled: 
Final  95%  PE  Traffic Circulation  Analysis  ­  Traffic  Analysis  Compendium, prepared  by  Dulles Rail 
Consultants.    The  traffic  analyses  included  in  this  Compendium,  in  accordance  with  the 
mitigation  improvements  identified  in  the  2006  Record  of  Decision  (ROD),  contemplated  an 
additional  northbound  through  lane  at  the  intersection  of  Reston  Parkway  and  Sunrise  Valley 
Drive.   As  a  follow  up  to  this  analyses,  MWAA/PMSS  had  prepared  this  supplemental  study  in 
order  to  evaluate  the  traffic  impacts  at  the  downstream  intersection  of  Reston  Parkway  and 
South  Lakes  Drive,  which  was  not  included  in  the  aforementioned  Compendium.   Specifically, 
the  study  evaluates  the  traffic  impacts  of  converting  the  existing  dedicated  northbound  right
turn lane along Reston Parkway, at South Lakes Drive, into a shared through/right lane. 

Figure  1  is  provided  to  illustrate  the  location  of  Reston  Parkway  and  South  Lakes  Drive 
intersection with respect to the surrounding roadway network.

EXISTING CONDITIONS 
 


The  intersection  of  Reston  Parkway  and  South  Lakes  Drive  is  a  fourway  signalized  intersection 
located  between  Sunrise  Valley  Drive  and  Glade  Drive  in  Fairfax  County,  Virginia.    Within  the 
vicinity of this intersection, Reston Parkway is a fourlane divided roadway with a posted speed 
limit  of  45  mph.   South  Lakes  Drive  (the  east  approach)  is  a  twolane  divided  roadway  with  a 
posted  speed  limit  of  25  mph.    South  Lakes  Drive  (the  west  approach)  serves  adjacent 
residential  communities  and  also  provides  access  to  the  United  States  Geological  Survey 
(USGS).  Dedicated single leftturn and rightturn lanes are provided along all approaches to the 
intersection  with  the  exception  of  the  northern  approach, which  maintains  dual  leftturn  lanes.  
Photographs are provided below depicting each approach to the intersection.

DESIGN YEAR 2030 TRAFFIC ANALYSES 
 


MWAA/PMSS  collected  weekday  AM  (79  AM)  and  PM  (46  PM)  peak  hour  turning  movement 
traffic counts at the intersection of Reston Parkway and South Lakes Drive in December of 2011 
(included  in  the  Appendix  section  of  this  report).   As  per  the  2011  Compendium,  these  counts 
were  increased  using  an  annual  compounded  growth  rate  of  1.45%  to  establish  future  traffic 
volumes for Design Year 2030 for all but the northbound and southbound through movements. 
The  northbound  and  southbound  through  volumes  along  Reston  Parkway  were  calculated 
based upon the Design Year traffic volumes calculated in the September 2011 Compendium for 
the  upstream  intersection  of  Reston  Parkway  and  Sunrise  Valley  Drive.   Figure  2  is  provided  to 
show the Design Year 2030 AM/PM peak hour traffic volumes at this intersection.

MWAA/PMSS  evaluated  the  traffic  operations  at  the  intersection  of  Reston  Parkway  and 
Sunrise  Valley  Drive  assuming  the  Design  Year  2030  AM/PM  peak  hour  traffic  volumes  shown 
on  Figure  2.    Accordingly,  analyses  was  performed  "with"  and  "without"  the  aforementioned 
proposed  northbound  lane  improvement  along  Reston  Parkway  using  Synchro/SimTraffic 
capacity  analysis  software.    The  Measures  of  Effectiveness  (MOE)  results  of  Levels  of  Service 
(LOS),  vehicle  delay  and  95th  percentile  back  of  queue  were  established  based  on  five  (5) 
simulation runs of SimTraffic (15 minutes seeding, 60 minutes recording).  Cycle length, phasing 
sequence  and  other  Synchro  parameters  are  consistent  with  the  Reston  Parkway  and  Sunrise 
Valley  Drive  analysis  performed  in  the  September  2011  Compendium.   All  SimTraffic  analyses 
worksheets are included in the Appendix section of this report.

CONCLUSION 
 


Assuming  2030  Design  Year  traffic  volumes,  the  intersection  of  Reston  Parkway  and  Sunrise 
Valley Drive would operate with overall LOS `D' during the AM peak hour and LOS `F' during the 
PM  peak  hour  (as  shown  in  Figure  3  as  well  as  Tables  1A  &  1B)  with  or  without  the 
improvement  of  converting  the  existing  dedicated  northbound  rightturn  lane  along  Reston 
Parkway,  at  South  Lakes  Drive,  into  a  shared  through/right  lane.    The  implementation  of  this 
improvement,  however,  would  result  in  a  reduction  in  back  of  queue  for  the  northbound 
through  movement  along  Reston  Parkway.    Accordingly,  the  95%  back  of  queue  for  the 
northbound  through  movement  would  decrease  from  975  feet  to  747  feet  during  the  AM  peak 
hour  and  from  350  feet  to  281  feet  during  the  PM  peak  hour.    With  or  without  the 
improvement,  the  northbound  through  back  of  queue  would  not  exceed  the  available  spacing 
of approximately 1,200 feet between Sunrise Valley Drive and South Lakes Drive.

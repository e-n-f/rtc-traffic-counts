EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location and Description
The Wake County Public School System is proposing to expand Panther Creek High School in
order to accommodate 264 additional 9th grade students and 11 additional teachers. The
expansion will consist of two modular classroom buildings and the site plan proposes to utilize
the two existing school driveways. Panther Creek High School is located on the north side of
McCrimmon Parkway, between NC 55 and Green Level Church Road in western Cary.

The NCDOT's Municipal School Transportation Assistance (MSTA) Group's School Calculator
was used to determine the amount of trips the site would generate in the AM peak period only.
Because the PM peak period of the school does not coincide with the PM peak period of the
adjacent roadways, a ratio was developed between the existing traffic counts for the 4-6 PM peak
period and the current student/staff population. This ratio was then applied to the proposed
additional students and teachers to estimate the number of new trips that could be expected for
the PM peak period. The trip generation summary is shown in Table 1.

The site plan proposes to utilize the existing two school driveways, with no plans for additional
access points. The eastern school driveway (Access 1) provides access to the student drop-off
area, faculty parking, and buss parking. Access 1 operates as an unsignalized intersection
restricted to right-in, left-in, and right-out movements only. The western school driveway (Access
2) provides access to student parking and the bus drop-off area. Access 2 operates as an
unsignalized, full-movement intersection. This traffic study, 13-TAR-366, analyzes the effects of
the proposed school expansion on traffic operations in the study area. Figure ES 1 shows the
study area for 13-TAR-366 while Figure ES 2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
The number of trips generated by the proposed high school expansion will exceed the Town's 50
peak hour trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4)
and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Adequate Public Facilities
Ordinance (APFO). The projected build-out year for this expansion is 2013. This TAR analyzes
the potential impacts of the proposed high school expansion on the adjacent roadways and offers
potential mitigation for those impacts.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):

   ·   9004 ­ McCrimmon Parkway and Cary Glen Boulevard
   ·   9005 ­ Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard

Traffic analyses were performed for the study area intersections listed above for four scenarios,
specifically:
   ·   Existing (2012) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts, aerial photography, site visit, and existing signal and timing data).
   ·   Background (2013) ­ Estimates future (2013) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 2%, 3%, and 4%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby
       developments that have not yet been constructed.
   ·   Combined (2013) ­ Adds the site generated traffic from the proposed high school
       expansion to the Background (2013) volumes.
   ·   Combined and Improved (2013) ­ Analyzes potential mitigations to provide acceptable
       levels of service based on the Town's LDO.

Background (2013) Analysis
Future traffic estimates were made based on applying an overall average annual growth rate
(AAGR) to the 2012 balanced counts. An AAGR of 2% was assumed for the intersections along
NC 55 and along O'Kelly Chapel. An AAGR of 4% was assumed for all other intersections,
except for the through movements at the two school access driveways, where an AAGR of 3%
was assumed since this was between an area of higher anticipated growth to areas with lower
anticipated growth over the next year. This also helped to balance traffic volumes along

APFO Required Mitigations
Two signalized intersections and four unsignalized intersections fell below the APFO threshold
with the additional site traffic. As such, mitigation was recommended for these intersections,
which is described below and shown in Figure ES 3.

   Intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
   This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period
   in the Combined (2013) conditions with increased delay in the PM peak period from the
   Background (2013) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay
   time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
   for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Since the geometrics of this intersection were
   modified considerably over the Existing conditions in the Background and Combined
   conditions, the cycle lengths and offsets were optimized for both the Background and
   Combined conditions. This optimization still resulted in 0.1 seconds per vehicle increase in
   delay.

   Several geometric improvements were also considered, such as extending the second lane
   on O'Kelly Chapel Road westbound from NC 55 to Green Level Church Road and adding an
   additional eastbound left-turn lane. Extending the westbound lane on O'Kelly Chapel Road
   was considered due to the fact that the additional lane provided by the Parkside Town
   Commons development in the background is assumed to drop approximately 1,000 feet west
   of the intersection. Based on the fact the second westbound lane is not a continuous lane the
   lane utilization factor was adjusted for the northbound left-turn and the westbound through
   movements to account for the fact that traffic will not be evenly distributed across both lanes.
   As a sensitivity test, Synchro's default value (same as Highway Capacity Manual default
   value) for lane utilization was used for the northbound left-turns and westbound left-turns.
   This test showed that with the default values for lane utilization, the Combined conditions still
   resulted in an increase of 0.1 seconds per vehicle of delay.

                                                                                  13-TAR-366
                                                                                       FINAL


Because the school expansion is projected to add 37 new trips in the AM peak period and 2
new trips in the PM peak period to this intersection (with the PM peak period being the
scenario requiring mitigation), extending the additional westbound lane on O'Kelly Chapel
Road was determined to be an excessive mitigation. Therefore, an additional eastbound left-
turn lane was considered. The provision of an additional left-turn lane will reduce the overall
intersection delay in the PM peak period to less than that shown in the Background (2013)
conditions. Therefore, the following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

   ·   Provide an additional 100' eastbound left-turn lane with appropriate taper.

With this mitigation, the intersection still operates at a LOS F in the PM peak period; however,
the overall intersection delay is less than that experienced in the Background (2013)
conditions.

Intersection of NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
This intersection operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period
in the Combined (2013) conditions with increased delay in both peak periods from the
Background (2013) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay
time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone.             Therefore, the following mitigation is
recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

   ·   Provide an exclusive 300' eastbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper

With this mitigation, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS D, in both
the AM and PM peak periods and with less intersection delay than experienced in the
Background (2013) conditions.

Intersection of O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road
This offset intersection has one movement, the shared northbound left and right-turn, that
operates at LOS F in both the AM and PM peak periods. This intersection also has one
movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS
F in the PM peak period. Both of these movements operate with increased delay in both the
AM and PM peak periods when compared to the Background (2013) conditions. Based on
Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. The CTP identifies the need for realignment of this intersection
and several TARs have previously recommended realigning and signalizing this intersection,
but to our knowledge, no funding has been made available. A signal warrant analysis was
performed for this intersection and is located in Appendix I. Based on the warrant analysis,
the intersection will meet the peak hour signal warrants. While meeting one signal warrant
does not guarantee the installation of a signal, the intersection was analyzed as a signalized
intersection in the Combined Improved conditions. The recommended mitigation is that the
existing offset intersection of Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road be

realigned to form a single four-leg intersection and signalized (if approved by the Town of
Cary and NCDOT) in order to meet APFO requirements. This improvement resulted in
acceptable level of service operations. The recommended laneage at this intersection to
meet the APFO is as follows:

   ·   Northbound ­ One shared left-turn, through and right-turn lane
   ·   Southbound ­ One left-turn lane with 250 feet of full storage and appropriate taper,
       one through lane, and one full right-turn lane
   ·   Eastbound ­ One shared left-turn, through and right-turn lane
   ·   Westbound ­ One left-turn lane with 175 feet of full storage with appropriate taper and
       one shared through and right-turn lane (this movement was analyzed under permitted
       conditions)

Intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Access 1
This intersection has one movement, the southbound right-turn, that operates at LOS F in the
AM peak period with increased delay from the Background (2013) conditions. Based on
Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. The following mitigation is recommended at this intersection in
order to meet the APFO requirements:

   ·   Provide a westbound right-turn lane with 175 feet of full storage and appropriate taper

With the provision of a westbound right-turn lane, the southbound right-turn movement still
operates at LOS F in the AM peak period, but with less delay than experienced in the
Background (2013) conditions. This mitigation also meets NCDOT's nomograph criteria and
since McCrimmon Parkway is maintained by NCDOT, the right-turn lane may also be
required by NCDOT. The storage length (175') is based on the NCDOT nomograph (found in
Appendix I).

Intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2
This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in the
AM peak period with increased delay from the Background (2013) conditions. Based on
Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. A peak hour signal warrant analysis was performed for this
intersection but the results indicate that the peak hour warrant is not met. Therefore, the
following mitigations are recommended to meet the Town's APFO and NCDOT's turn lane
requirements:

   ·   Restrict southbound approach to provide one right-turn lane only
   ·   Provide a westbound right-turn lane with 175 feet of full storage and appropriate taper
       (NCDOT nomograph, Appendix I). It should be noted that this mitigation is not
       required per the APFO.

                                                                                         FINAL


   With just the provision of a westbound right-turn lane, the southbound left-turn movement still
   operates at LOS F, with Synchro unable to report the delay and an increased volume to
   capacity ratio as compared to the Background (2013) condition.

   With the intersection reconfiguration of the southbound approach to prohibit left-turns, the
   southbound movement operates at improved level of service, LOS B, in the AM peak period
   with less delay than experienced by the southbound left-turns in the Background (2013)
   conditions. Vehicles wishing to make this restricted movement can be accommodated by
   making a U-turn at the downstream intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Cary Glen
   Boulevard, approximately 1,900 feet to the west. It should be noted that during the field
   investigation for this TAR, which was conducted on a weekday afternoon and coincided with
   the end of the school day, it was observed that Access 2 serves the student drivers and there
   was considerable queuing on the southbound approach of this intersection. A large number
   of vehicles were also observed to make the right-turn and subsequent U-turn maneuver due
   to heavy southbound left-turn queuing. Therefore this recommendation was considered in-
   line with the operations of this intersection during peak hours.

   Intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
   This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in both
   the AM and PM peak periods with increased delay from the Background (2013) conditions.
   Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
   unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
   Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to
   meet the APFO requirements.

   Several geometric improvements were considered, such as exclusive turn lanes, but they did
   not provide the necessary improvement in delay. Therefore, due to the increase in delay for
   a movement operating at LOS F, an evaluation of peak hour signal warrants was performed
   and is included in Appendix I. The peak hour signal warrant evaluation indicates this
   intersection will meet peak hour warrants in the Combined (2013) scenario. According to the
   Town of Cary, a signal warrant analysis has recently been performed and agreed upon by
   NCDOT. Additionally, several other TARs have also recommended signalization of this
   intersection. Based on this and the APFO requirements, the recommended mitigation is that
   the a signal be installed at the intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen
   Boulevard in order to meet APFO requirements. This intersection was analyzed as a two-
   phase signalized intersection in the Combined Improved conditions, which resulted in overall
   LOS A operations with all movements operating at LOS A in the AM and PM peak periods.

Table 2a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the 2013 Background, 2013
Combined, and 2013 Combined and Improved conditions. The results provided in Table 2a
show that with the recommended mitigations, the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection
and the NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection meet the requirements of the APFO.

Table 2a also shows that all other signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better in all
scenarios and do not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Table 2b provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersections in the 2013 Background, 2013
Combined, and 2013 Combined and Improved conditions. As indicated in Table 2b, the O'Kelly
Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road intersection, the McCrimmon Parkway and Access
1 intersection, the McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2 intersection, and the Carpenter Fire
Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection all do not meet the APFO requirements.
With the provision of a signal, the O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road
intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS B in the PM peak period. Also
with the provision of a signal, the Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
intersection operates at an overall LOS A in the AM and PM peak periods. With the provision of
a westbound right-turn lane at the McCrimmon Parkway Access 1 intersection, the southbound
right-turn movement still operates at LOS F, but with 43.5 seconds per vehicle less delay than in
the Background (2013) conditions. Additionally, the restriction of the southbound approach at the
McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2 intersection to right-turn only movements results in LOS C
operations for the southbound movements in the AM peak period and the downstream U-turn
operates at LOS A with the additional traffic from Access 2. Each of these three intersections
show an improvement compared to 2013 Background and 2013 Combined conditions and
satisfies the requirements of the Town of Cary's APFO.

1.       INTRODUCTION
The Wake County Public School System is proposing to expand Panther Creek High School in
order to accommodate 264 additional 9th grade students and 11 additional teachers. The
expansion will consist of two modular classroom buildings and the site plan proposes to utilize
the two existing school driveways. Panther Creek High School is located on the north side of
McCrimmon Parkway, between NC 55 and Green Level Church Road in western Cary. Figure 1
provides the study area and site location. All figures are located in Appendix A.

The number of trips generated by the proposed high school expansion will exceed the Town's 50
peak hour trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4)
and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Adequate Public Facilities
Ordinance (APFO). The projected build-out year for this expansion is 2013. This TAR analyzes
the potential impacts of the proposed high school expansion on the adjacent roadways and offers
potential mitigation for those impacts. The site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
     ·   2301 ­ NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
     ·   2201 ­ NC 55 and NC 540 Southbound Off-Ramp

2.      EXISTING (2012) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.

        2.1.1. NC 55
        NC 55 is a major north-south highway that, in the vicinity of the project, runs from the City
        of Durham through northwestern Wake County and into Harnett County. NC 55 provides
        access to multiple major roadways in southwestern Wake County, including I-40, NC 540,
        US 64, US 1 and the Western Wake Expressway toll facility. The typical section of NC 55
        within the study area limits is a median-divided four-lane roadway. In the study area, NC
        55 has a posted speed limit of 50 mph. NC 55 had a 2011 AADT of 16,000 vehicles north
        of NC 540 and 29,000 vehicles per day between NC 540 and Morrisville-Carpenter Road
        (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

        2.1.2. NC 540
        NC 540 is a major north-south freeway in the study area that is part of the overall I-
        540/NC 540 loop in Wake County. The most recently completed portion of NC 540 runs
        from the NC 55 Bypass in Holly Springs to NC 55 in northern Apex, where it connects to
        the previously constructed portion of NC 540. From there, NC 540 provides a connection
        to the Research Triangle Park (RTP) via NC 147 and I-40. At I-40, this facility changes
        names to I-540 and continues in a loop around northern and eastern Wake County, where
        it ends at US 64/264 in Knightdale. NC 540 is a toll facility (known as Triangle
        Expressway) between I-40 in RTP and NC 55 Bypass in Holly Springs. NC 540 had a
        2011 AADT of 19,000 vehicles between NC 55 in Apex and NC 147 (based on 2011
        NCDOT traffic volume GIS data). It should be noted that this volume count was taken
        prior to the NC 55 to NC 55 Bypass section opening to traffic.

        2.1.3. O'KELLY CHAPEL ROAD (SR 1628)
        O'Kelly Chapel Road is an east-west connector road that runs from NC 751 in Chatham
        County to NC 55 in northwestern Wake County. The typical section within the study limits
        is a two-lane, undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 50 mph. O'Kelly Chapel
        Road serves developments to the west of NC 55 in the northern portion of the study
        limits. O'Kelly Chapel Road had a 2011 AADT of 6,400 vehicles just west of Green Level
        Church Road (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

        2.1.4. GREEN LEVEL CHURCH ROAD (SR 1625)
        Green Level Church Road is a major north-south connector, has a posted speed limit of
        45 mph in the study area, and runs from NC 55 north of the Wake/Durham County Line to
        US 64 in Apex. The typical section of Green Level Church Road within the study limits is
        a four-lane median-divided roadway north of O'Kelly Chapel Road and south of
        McCrimmon Parkway.         The typical section between O'Kelly Chapel Road and
                                                  2
                                                                             13-TAR-366
                                                                                  FINAL


McCrimmon Parkway is a two-lane, undivided roadway. Green Level Church Road had a
2011 AADT of 4,900 vehicles just south of its intersection with O'Kelly Chapel Road and
7,900 vehicles just south of its intersection with Carpenter Fire Station Road (based on
2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

2.1.5. MCCRIMMON PARKWAY (SR 1635/3127)
McCrimmon Parkway is a major east-west connector that runs from Yates Store Road in
the Amberly neighborhood of Cary east to NC 55 where it currently ends. In the Town of
Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP), it is planned to extend McCrimmon
Parkway from NC 55 east to where another section of McCrimmon Parkway intersects
with Louis Stephens Drive. When the connection is made, McCrimmon Parkway will
extend to NC 54 (Chapel Hill Road). Panther Creek High School is on the portion of
McCrimmon Parkway between NC 55 and Yates Store Road. McCrimmon Parkway has
a posted speed limit of 45 mph in the study area, but is 35 mph in the school zone on
school days during the arrival and dismissal times of the school. The typical section of
McCrimmon Parkway is a two-lane divided roadway just west of NC 55 and widens to a
four-lane divided typical section just west of Panther Creek High School.

2.1.6. CARY GLEN BOULEVARD
Cary Glen Boulevard has a posted speed limit of 35 mph in the study area and is a north-
south collector road that runs from McCrimmon Parkway southwest to Weldon Ridge
Boulevard. Cary Glen Boulevard serves mostly residential land use along with retail
development between Carpenter Fire Station Road and Green Level Church Road. The
typical section of Cary Glen Boulevard within the study limits is a two-lane roadway with a
center two-way left-turn lane north of Carpenter Fire Station Road and a two-lane
undivided roadway south of Carpenter Fire Station Road.

2.1.7. CARPENTER FIRE STATION ROAD (SR 1624)
Carpenter Fire Station Road is an east-west connector that runs from Allforth Place in
Chatham County east to Morrisville Carpenter Road in Cary and provides access to the
commuter routes, Triangle Expressway, and NC 55. The typical section of Carpenter Fire
Station Road is mostly a four-lane, median divided roadway in the study area but narrows
to a two-lane, undivided section just east of Cameron Pond Drive. The Town of Cary's
CTP identifies the vision to widen the entire length of Carpenter Fire Station Road to a
four-lane median-divided facility in the future. This widening is not anticipated to occur
before buildout of the Panther Creek High School expansion. Carpenter Fire Station
Road has a posted speed limit of 45 mph from east of Yates Store Road to NC 55, where
it changes to 35 mph. Carpenter Fire Station Road had a 2011 AADT of 11,000 vehicles
just west of NC 55 (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

   2.1.8. INDIAN WELLS ROAD (SR 1623)
   Indian Wells Road is a local road that provides access to a few homes on the west side of
   NC 55. East of NC 55, Indian Wells Road becomes Morrisville Carpenter Road. The
   typical section of Indian Wells Road is a two-lane undivided roadway throughout the study
   area. Indian Wells Road has a 2011 AADT of 310 vehicles in (based on 2011 NCDOT
   traffic volume GIS data). Indian Wells Road has a posted speed limit of 35 mph in the
   study area.

   2.1.9. MORRISVILLE CARPENTER ROAD (SR 3014)
   Morrisville Carpenter Road is a major east-west connector that runs from NC 55 in Cary
   east to NC 54 where it becomes Aviation Parkway in Morrisville, NC. From there,
   Aviation Parkway extends northward to I-40, Raleigh-Durham International Airport and
   into the Brier Creek neighborhood of Raleigh. The typical section of Morrisville Carpenter
   Road in the study area is a two-lane undivided roadway. Morrisville Carpenter Road has
   a 2011 AADT of 7,500 vehicles in between Carpenter Fire Station Road and Good Hope
   Church Road (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data). Morrisville Carpenter
   Road currently has an at-grade crossing with the CSXT railway that runs north-south
   through the study area. Morrisville Carpenter Road has a posted speed limit of 35 mph in
   the study area.

2.2.       Existing Intersections
All intersections within the study area that were analyzed are listed in Section 1 of this report.
All intersections are within the Town Limits of Cary or within the Town of Cary's ETJ.
Intersection geometrics along with intersection operation controls are provided in Figure 3.

2.3.       Turning Movement Counts
Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
October and November 2012 for all intersections. Panther Creek High School was in session
when the counts were taken. The count data is located in Appendix C. These counts were
taken to provide current volumes and assist in determining the directional splits of existing
traffic. The count volumes were balanced in areas where appropriate and grown one year at
the determined growth rate (discussed in Section 3.1) to estimate 2013 volumes. The
volumes that were used in the analyses are shown on Figure 4 and the volume calculations
are located in Appendix D. The following table, Table 1, lists the time and place counts were
conducted.

Exhibit 19-1 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are provided in Table 3 below.

Panther Creek High School is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone which is
described in Section 3.23.3 of the LDO. For areas located within the Base Benefit Zone, the
level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are based on achieving a
LOS D or better for all intersections located within the study area (measured overall for
signalized intersections and by movement for unsignalized intersections) currently operating
at LOS D or better or not increasing delay (overall intersection delay for signalized and

worse than LOS D without the high school expansion in the build-out year.

2.5.       Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. The following Synchro coding
assumptions were made for existing conditions and included in all future analyses unless
otherwise noted:

   ·   A default value of four vehicles was input for movements where zero vehicles were
       counted based on NCDOT's Capacity Analysis Guidelines. The only exception to this
       is the westbound u-turn lane at the eastern school driveway.
   ·   The following movements were coded to not allow right turns on red (RTOR) based on
       restrictions observed in the field investigation:
            o Eastbound right-turn at Green Level Church Road and McCrimmon Parkway
            o Westbound right-turn at Green Level Church Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
   ·   Several unsignalized intersections had u-turning movements in at least one peak
       period.     In these instances, u-turning movements were added to left-turning
       movements to provide a more realistic level of service since Synchro does not
       account for U-turn movements at unsignalized intersections in its level of service
       calculations. Synchro files with the u-turning movements were also maintained for all
       scenarios for simulation purposes.
   ·   The peak hour factor for all movements at both school driveway intersections was
       adjusted for the AM peak period based upon the peaking characteristics shown in the
       peak hour counts. A minimum peak hour factor of 0.50 was maintained based on
       guidelines from NCDOT's Municipal School Transportation Assistance (MSTA) group.
       Therefore, the peak hour factors from the AM peak period counts were used for the
       school driveways unless that value fell below 0.50 in which case a minimum of 0.50
       was used.
   ·   The traffic counts for the AM peak period also indicated that the majority of school
       traffic uses the McCrimmon Parkway and NC 55 intersection, The southbound right-
       turn and the northbound left-turn movements largely consist of school traffic in the AM
       peak period; therefore, the peak hour factor for these movements were also adjusted
       based on the AM peak hour counts.
   ·   The link speeds on McCrimmon Parkway across the school frontage were coded as
       35 mph in the AM peak period only, to correspond with the speed limit posted for the
       school zone.

Levels of service and delay were reported for each yielding movement at unsignalized
intersections. For signalized intersections, levels of service and delay were reported for the
signal as a whole. The summary of the findings are located in Tables 4a and 4b below.

     As shown by Table 4a, one signalized intersection, NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road,
     operates at LOS E in both the AM and PM peak periods.

     As shown in Table 4b, all unsignalized intersections and movements operate better than the
     level of service criteria of LOS D for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone aside from four
     intersections that have one movement operating at LOS E or LOS F. The northbound left
     and right-turn at the unsignalized intersection of O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level
     Church Road operates at LOS F in both the AM and the PM peak periods. The southbound
     right-turn at the unsignalized intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Access 1, as well as
     the southbound left-turn at McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2 operates at LOS F in the AM
     peak period. The southbound left-turn at the unsignalized intersection of Carpenter Fire
     Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard operates at LOS E in both the AM and PM peak
     periods. The 2012 Existing analysis results are located in Appendix E.



3.      BACKGROUND (2013) CONDITIONS
     3.1.      Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information, developing land uses in the area, the extension of
     Triangle Expressway, and information from adjacent development TARs, an overall annual
     growth rate of 2% was assumed for the intersections along NC 55 and along O'Kelly Chapel
     Road. An overall annual growth rate of 4% was assumed for the Green Level Church Road
     intersections with McCrimmon Parkway, Carpenter Fire Station Road, and Cary Glen
     Boulevard, as well as the Cary Glen Boulevard intersections with McCrimmon Parkway and
     Carpenter Fire Station Road. An overall annual growth rate of 3% was assumed for the

through movements at the two school access driveways, as this seemed to be an area of
transition between an area of higher anticipated growth to areas with lower anticipated growth
over the next year. This also helped to balance traffic volumes along McCrimmon Parkway in
2013. These growth rates were applied to the existing 2012 volumes to determine the
projected volumes for the Background (2013) analysis. There were also additional trips
added to account for known approved developments that are not yet constructed. These trips
were based on other TARs provided by the Town of Cary. All additional developments are
described in the following sections. Previously analyzed development trip generation
information as well as the total approved development site trips added to the network are
located in Appendix F. The total 2013 background traffic volumes, including the approved
development trips are shown in Figure 5. The following are the approved developments
considered in the background traffic for this TAR:

   3.1.1. 09-TAR-149A ­ CAMERON POND UPDATE
   The Cameron Pond Update is an amendment to the analysis performed for the existing
   Cameron Pond neighborhood. The update consists of an additional 15 home sites and is
   located on Carpenter Fire Station Road to the east of the study area for this analysis.
   Therefore, site traffic from the additional Cameron Pond development will be added to the
   background traffic and included in this analysis.

   3.1.2. 11-TAR-325 ­ CARPENTER PROPERTY
   The Carpenter Property TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development
   located in the northwest quadrant of the Green Level Church Road and McCrimmon
   Parkway intersection. The development will consist of 75 single-family homes and is
   estimated to be complete in 2013. Therefore, the site traffic for this development will be
   added to the study network at the McCrimmon Parkway and Green Level Church Road
   intersection. The site traffic will then be distributed through the network based on existing
   count patterns and probable trip origins/destinations.

   3.1.3. 11-TAR-326A ­ AMBERLY TOWN CENTER
   The Amberly TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development in the Amberly
   Planned Development District and will be located in the southeast quadrant of the O'Kelly

Chapel Road and Yates Store Road intersection. Both phases of the development will
consist of a total of 184 townhomes and are estimated to be complete in 2013. Both
Green Level Church Road intersections with O'Kelly Chapel Road were included in the
Amberly Town Center TAR. Therefore, the site traffic from this development will be
added to the study network at these two offset intersections. The site traffic will then be
distributed through the network based on existing count patterns and probable trip
origins/destinations.

3.1.4. 11-TAR-332 ­ ALSTON TOWN CENTER
The Alston Town Center TAR was conducted for a large mixed-use retail development
located in the southwest quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540 Northbound Off-Ramp
intersection. This development also proposes access via the Highcroft Drive Extension,
located just east of Panther Creek High School Access 1. The development is estimated
to be complete by 2015 and will consist of 355,905 square feet of shopping center,
30,125 square feet of office space, 37 townhomes, a 150 room hotel, a 5,255 square-foot
bank, 7,398 square feet of a high-turnover/sit down restaurant, a 3,500 square-foot fast
food restaurant, a gas station with a convenience store and 16 fuel pumps, a 14,708
square-foot pharmacy, and 590 apartments. Based on discussions with the Town of Cary
Planning Department, this development is not likely to have anything constructed and in
use by the 2013 build-out year for the Panther Creek High School Expansion. Therefore,
these site trips were not included in this analysis.

3.1.5. 12-TAR-340 ­ CFS ROAD REZONING
The CFS Road Rezoning TAR was conducted for the proposed rezoning of 6910
Carpenter Fire Station Road from a residential to an office and industrial land use. This
parcel is located on the north side of Carpenter Fire Station Road, just west of its
intersection with NC 55. Based on our understanding of this development, there is no site
plan currently approved for construction. Given this, and the fact that the build-out year
for the CFS Rezoning development is 2016, the site traffic from the development was not
included in this analysis.

3.1.6. 12-TAR-346 ­ CARY GLEN TOWNHOMES
The Cary Glen Townhomes TAR was conducted for a development consisting of 152
residential townhome units located in the southeast quadrant of the Carpenter Fire
Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection. The proposed build-out year for the
Cary Glen Townhomes development is 2016 and it is our understanding that there is no
site plan currently approved for construction. Therefore, the site traffic from the Cary Glen
Townhomes development was not included in this analysis.

3.1.7. 12-TAR-348 ­ CARY PARK PARCEL TC-3A
The Cary Park Parcel TC-3A TAR was conducted for the proposed development of
20,000 square feet of office space in the southeast quadrant of the Carpenter Fire Station
Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection. This parcel is located north of the proposed
Cary Glen Townhomes development described above. The proposed build-out year for
this development is 2014; therefore, fifty percent of the site traffic from the office
development will be added to the background traffic and included in this analysis.

3.1.8. 12-TAR-350 ­ PARKSIDE TOWN COMMONS
The Parkside Town Commons TAR was conducted for a large mixed-use development
that consists of 300 residential apartment units, two 140-room hotels, a 12-screen movie
theater, a 16-lane bowling alley, 501,000 square feet of retail, 65,000 square feet of high-
turnover (sit-down) restaurants, and 31,000 square feet of fast-food restaurants with a
drive-thru window. This development is located to the northeast of the NC 540
interchange with NC 55. The proposed build-out year for this development is 2016, but it
is assumed that a portion will be constructed and in use by the 2013 build-out year of the
Panther Creek High School Expansion. Therefore, site traffic from the southern parcel
(Phase 1) of the Parkside development will be added to the background traffic and
included in this analysis.

Based on discussions with and information provided by the Town of Cary, a portion of the
roadway improvements were also assumed to be in place as mitigation from the Parkside
Town Commons development. The following improvements were assumed to be in place
in our 2013 analyses:

   ·   O'Kelly Chapel Road constructed as the fourth leg of the NC 55 and O'Kelly
       Chapel Road intersection
   ·   Construction of three exclusive left-turn lanes, two through lanes, and one
       exclusive right-turn lane on the westbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road at
       NC 55
   ·   Widening of the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide an
       exclusive left-turn lane, two exclusive through lanes, and an exclusive right-turn
       lane at NC 55 (the second through lane is assumed to begin approximately 1,000'
       west of the intersection)
   ·   Construction of a third northbound through lane on NC 55 across the property
       frontage
   ·   Construction of an exclusive northbound right-turn lane at the NC 55 and O'Kelly
       Chapel Road intersection
   ·   Construction of an additional northbound left-turn lane at the NC 55 and O'Kelly
       Chapel Road intersection
   ·   Construction of an additional westbound lane on O'Kelly Chapel Road to receive
       the dual northbound left-turn lanes (assumed to be dropped approximately 1,000'
       west of the intersection)

                                                                                      FINAL


       ·   Construction of an exclusive southbound right-turn lane at the NC 55 and O'Kelly
           Chapel Road intersection

   The lane utilization factor in Synchro was adjusted based on a 60/40 split for the
   northbound left-turn lanes and westbound through lanes at the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel
   Road intersection in the Background (2013) and Combined (2013) analyses. This
   adjustment was made based on the assumed 1,000 foot lane drop for the additional
   westbound through lane west of NC 55 and the imbalanced lane utilization that would
   result from the downstream lane drop.

   3.1.9. 13-TAR-363 ­ CARY PARK TRACT MR-8 APARTMENTS
   The Cary Park Tract MR-8 Apartments TAR was conducted for a development consisting
   of 235 residential apartment units. This parcel is located in the southeast quadrant of the
   Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection, just south of the Cary
   Park Parcel TC-3A development described in Section 3.1.12, above. The proposed build-
   out year for this development is 2015; therefore, one-third of the site traffic from the
   apartment development will be added to the background traffic and included in this
   analysis.

   3.1.10.        13-TAR-364 ­ RETAIL CENTER, RKM DEVELOPMENT
   The RKM Development TAR was conducted for a retail development consisting of a
   54,000 square foot grocery store, 7,350 square feet of general shops, 14,820 square feet
   of pharmacy with a drive-thru, two banks at 3,200 square feet each, and two fast food
   restaurants with a drive-thru at 3,750 square feet each. The RKM Development parcel is
   located in the northeast quadrant of Green Level Church Road and Carpenter Fire Station
   Road and has a proposed build-out year of 2015. Based on discussions with the Town of
   Cary Planning Department, the RKM Development does not have a site plan currently
   approved for construction and is not likely to have any portion built and open for traffic by
   the 2013 build-out year of the Panther Creek High School Expansion. Therefore, site
   traffic from the proposed RKM Development was not included in this analysis.

3.2. NC 55 Improvements
The Town of Cary's CTP identifies NC 55 as a future six-lane median-divided facility in the
project study area (currently four-lane divided). Based on information provided by the Town
of Cary, the Town will construct an additional southbound through lane on NC 55 from the
Durham County line to NC 540 by the spring of 2013 in order to partially satisfy this vision.
This additional lane was included in the Background (2013) and all subsequent analyses. As
a result of this addition and the addition of improvements as mitigation from the Parkside
Town Commons development discussed in Section 3.1.8, the yellow and all-red signal
timings were changed in the analyses to 5 seconds and 2 seconds, respectively, and the
splits and offset were optimized for the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection. It
should be noted that while the splits and offset were optimized, the existing cycle length was
maintained to help maintain progression along NC 55.

                                                                                     FINAL


3.3. NC 540 Traffic Reduction
The Triangle Expressway (NC 540) has recently been constructed in the study area and
provided a six-lane freeway link (tolled) from the NC 55 Bypass in Holly Springs north to NC
55 in Apex. The first phase of this project connected NC 54 north of Morrisville and NC 55 in
Apex and was opened to traffic on December 8, 2011. The second phase connected NC 540
between NC 55 and US 64 in Apex, while the third phase provided the connection between
US 64 in Apex and the NC 55 Bypass in Holly Springs. This third phase was opened to traffic
on December 20, 2012. At the time traffic counts were conducted for this TAR, only the first
and second phases were open to traffic. The third phase was opened to traffic after the
counts for this TAR were conducted in November 2012. It was assumed that a portion of
existing NC 55 traffic in the study area would be diverted to NC 540, with this newest section
now open. Therefore a traffic reduction was applied in the Background (2013) traffic volume
calculations. In order to estimate this reduction, the traffic counts taken for 12-TAR-350
(Parkside Town Commons), described in Section 3.1.8 of this TAR, were adjusted by a
seasonal factor (provided by NCDOT) and compared to the existing traffic counts taken for
this TAR. The Parkside Development TAR was consulted due to the fact that counts for that
TAR occurred before the second phase of Triangle Expressway was completed. When these
volumes were compared to the traffic counts taken with the second phase open, traffic
volumes on NC 55 just south of the NC 540 interchange were reduced by approximately
20%. The third phase of the Triangle Expressway between US 64 and the NC 55 Bypass is
assumed to further reduce NC 55 traffic in the study area; however, given the location and
distance of phase three, the reduction of traffic on NC 55 in our study area is assumed to be
relatively small. Therefore, to account for the completion of phase three of Triangle
Expressway, a traffic reduction of 5% was applied to all movements at the NC 540 and NC 55
interchange while through movements at all other study intersections along NC 55 were
adjusted to reflect this reduction.

3.4.       Level of Service Analysis
Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2013) AM and PM peak periods which includes the approved development site
trips, NC 55 improvements, and the NC 540 traffic reduction as described in the above
sections along with the annual growth of existing traffic using the annual growth rates
described in Section 3.1. This analysis will be used as the base case to determine the
impacts for the Panther Creek High School Expansion.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2013) analysis are shown by Figure 5. The
summary of the level of service analysis for the Background (2013) conditions is reported in
Tables 5a and 5b.

     in at least one of the peak periods. The intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and
     Green Level Church Road has one movement, the shared northbound left and right-turn,
     which operates at LOS F in both the AM and PM peak periods, while the southbound left-turn
     movement operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period. The
     southbound right-turn at Access 1 and the southbound left-turn at Access 2 both operate at
     LOS F in the AM peak period. The intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary
     Glen Boulevard has one movement, the southbound left-turn, which operates at LOS F in
     both the AM and PM peak periods. The 2013 Background analyses are located in Appendix
     G.



4.      COMBINED (2013) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Zone and therefore recommendations will be based on a level of service standard of "D".
The Panther Creek High School Expansion is proposed to consist of two modular classrooms
that will accommodate 264 additional 9th grade students and 11 additional teachers. The site
plan proposes to utilize the existing two school driveways.

4.1.       Trip Generation
The MSTA School Calculator was used to determine the amount of trips the site would
generate in the AM peak period only. Because the PM peak period of the school does not
coincide with the PM peak period of the adjacent roadways, a ratio was developed between
the existing traffic counts for the 4-6 PM peak period and the current student/staff population.
This ratio was then applied to the proposed additional students and teachers to estimate the
number of new trips that could be expected for the PM peak period. Because the School
Calculator allows inputs for an Elementary, Middle, and High School, the MSTA group was
contacted for assistance on using the school calculator to estimate trip generation for 9th
grade students only. According to MSTA, the calculations for a high school accounts for
some portion of the arrivals and departures being student drivers. Based on guidance from
MSTA, inputs to the School Calculator for this TAR were for a middle school, assuming that
there would be no student drivers in the proposed expansion consisting of only 9th graders.
The trip generation summary is shown in Table 6 below. The school calculator and the PM
peak period volume calculations are located in Appendix D.

               teachers


4.2.       Trip Distribution
The additional traffic generated by the expansion is proposed to utilize the existing school
driveways, with no plans for new additional access points. In order to obtain information on
current student assignments, the Wake County Public School System was contacted for
information regarding the geographic location of existing students and staff; however, our
phone call was not returned. Therefore, trip distribution was estimated based on count data
from the existing school driveways and nearby intersections, and from knowledge of local trip
attractions and destinations in the area. Trip distribution at Access 1 and Access 2 was
determined based on the type of drivers these driveways currently serve. School Access 1
currently provides access to the student drop-off area, faculty parking, and bus parking.
School Access 2 provides access to student parking and the bus drop-off area. Since 9th
graders are not expected to drive to school, the majority of additional traffic was sent to
Access 1. The site distribution percentages are shown on Figure 6 and the site trips are
shown on Figure 7. The trip generation and distribution calculations are located in Appendix
D.

 4.3.       Combined (2013) Level of Service Analysis
 The Combined (2013) scenario consists of the background with approved development traffic
 as discussed in Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed
 school expansion. The volumes that are used in the Combined (2013) analysis are shown in
 Figure 8. The laneage and traffic control used for the Combined (2013) scenario is based on
 the existing conditions provided by Figure 3 along with the addition of roadway improvements
 described in Section 3.1 of this TAR.

 Level of service analyses were performed for all existing intersections. A summary of the
 levels of service is found in Tables 7a and 7b below.

   As seen in Tables 7a and 7b, most intersections experience little to no change between the
   Background (2013) and Combined (2013) scenarios. However, as with the Background
   (2013) analyses, two signalized intersections operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base
   Benefit Transportation Zone. These results, provided in Table 7a, indicate that both
   intersections show an increase in delay in at least one of the peak periods when compared to
   the Background (2013) analyses. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay
   time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
   for the Based Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, additional improvements will be
   required at these intersections in order to mitigate the increase in delay and meet the APFO
   requirements. The proposed improvements are described in Section 4.4.

Based on the Combined (2013) analyses, four unsignalized intersections have one or more
movements that operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone
in at least one of the peak periods. The results provided in Table 7b indicate that of these
four, the O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road intersection, the McCrimmon
Parkway and Access 1 intersection, and the Carpenter Fire Station and Cary Glen Boulevard
intersection all show an increase in delay when compared to the Background (2013)
Conditions.    The southbound left-turn movement at the unsignalized intersection of
McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2 operates at LOS F in the AM peak period of both the
Background (2013) and Combined (2013) conditions. However, the delay for the southbound
movement at this intersection is too high to be calculated using HCM methods and is not
reported by Synchro. Therefore, the delay from the SimTraffic simulation was used to
compare the operations between the Background (2013) and Combined (2013) conditions. It
should also be noted that with the increase in volume and no increase in capacity, the delay
for this movement will increase. As shown in Table 7b, the SimTraffic delay for this
southbound left-turn movement shows an increase when compared to the Background (2013)
conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at unsignalized intersections no movements
are allowed to fall below the LOS D threshold or experience an increase in delay for
movements that already operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit
Transportation Zone. Therefore, these unsignalized intersections will require additional
mitigation to meet the APFO. Potential mitigations are evaluated and described in Section
4.4. The Combined (2013) analyses are located in Appendix H.

The following provides the results of the 2013 Combined analysis and how they relate to the
APFO requirements.

Intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period.
The results provided in Table 7a indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in
delay of 0.1 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak period when compared to the background
analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for
signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Based
Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to
meet APFO requirements. These improvements are described in Section 4.4.

Intersection of NC 55 and NC 540 Southbound Off-Ramp
This intersection operates at LOS A in both the AM and PM peak periods. Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of NC 55 and NC 540 Southbound On-Ramp
This intersection operates at LOS A in the AM peak period and LOS B in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

The results provided in Table 7a indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in
delay of 5.9 seconds per vehicle in the AM peak period and 0.1 seconds per vehicle in the
PM peak period when compared to the background analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the
LDO, no increase in overall intersection delay is allowed for signalized intersections with a
level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Based Benefit Transportation Zone.
Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to meet APFO requirements.
These improvements are described in Section 4.4.

NC 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road
This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS B in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet the APFO requirements.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road (two offset intersections)
This intersection has one movement, the shared northbound left and right-turn, that operates
at LOS F in both the AM and PM peak periods. This intersection also has one movement,
the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM
peak period. The results provided in Table 7b indicate that the northbound left and right-turn
movement shows an overall increase in delay of 22.4 seconds per vehicle in the AM peak

period and 10.4 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak period when compared to the
background analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is
allowed for movements at unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D
threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this
intersection in order to meet the APFO requirements. These improvements are described in
Section 4.4.

McCrimmon Parkway and Access 1
This intersection has one movement, the southbound right-turn, that operates at LOS F in the
AM peak period. The results provided in Table 7b indicate that this movement shows an
overall increase in delay of 264.3 seconds per vehicle in the AM peak period when compared
to the background analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is
allowed for movements at unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D
threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this
intersection in order to meet the APFO requirements. These improvements are described in
Section 4.4. In addition, because McCrimmon Parkway is maintained by NCDOT, the
NCDOT nomograph for turn lanes will be evaluated for this access.

McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2
This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in the
AM peak period. Because the delay for this movement in the AM peak period is too high to
be calculated using HCM methods, it is not reported in Synchro. Therefore, the delay from
the SimTraffic simulation was used to compare the operations between the Background
(2013) and Combined (2013) conditions. The results provided in Table 7b indicate that the
SimTraffic delay for this movement increases by 15.9 seconds per vehicle when compared to
the background analysis. It is also safe to assume that, with the addition of over 100 vehicles
to this intersection with no increase in capacity, the delay will increase. Based on Section
3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at unsignalized
intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit
Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to meet the
APFO requirements. These improvements are described in Section 4.4. In addition,
because McCrimmon Parkway is maintained by NCDOT, the NCDOT nomograph for turn
lanes will be evaluated for this access.

McCrimmon Parkway and Cary Glen Boulevard
Since all movements at this intersection are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in both
the AM and PM peak periods. The results provided in Table 7b indicate that this movement
experiences an overall increase in delay of 0.8 seconds per vehicle in the AM peak period.
Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at

unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to
meet the APFO requirements. These improvements are described in Section 4.4.

4.4.       Combined (2013) Improved Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2013) Improved scenario consists of improvements identified as mitigations
that are proposed in order to meet the LOS D threshold or show no increase in overall
intersection/movement delay if the intersection/movement operates below LOS D in the
background condition as noted in Section 4.3. As noted in Section 4.3, two signalized
intersections and four unsignalized intersections meet these criteria in the Combined (2013)
conditions. The intersections requiring mitigation are listed below, along with the proposed
mitigation. The 2013 Combined with Improvements Synchro analyses are located in
Appendix I.

Intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period
in the Combined (2013) conditions with increased delay in the PM peak period from the
Background (2013) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay
time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Since the geometrics of this intersection were
modified considerably over the Existing conditions in the Background and Combined
conditions, the cycle lengths and offsets were optimized for both the Background and
Combined conditions. This optimization still resulted in 0.1 seconds per vehicle increase in
delay.

Several geometric improvements were also considered, such as extending the second lane
on O'Kelly Chapel Road westbound from NC 55 to Green Level Church Road and adding an
additional eastbound left-turn lane. Extending the westbound lane on O'Kelly Chapel Road
was considered due to the fact that the additional lane provided by the Parkside Town
Commons development in the background is assumed to drop approximately 1,000 feet west
of the intersection. As previously discussed, this resulted in the adjustment of the lane
utilization factor for the northbound left-turn and the westbound through movements because
traffic will not be evenly distributed across both lanes. As a sensitivity test, Synchro's default
value for lane utilization was used in the northbound left-turns and westbound left-turns. This
test showed that with the default values for lane utilization, the Combined conditions still
resulted in an increase of 0.1 seconds per vehicle of delay.

Because the school expansion is only projected to add 37 new trips in the AM peak period
and 2 new trips in the PM peak period to this intersection (with the PM peak period being the
scenario requiring mitigation), extending the additional westbound lane on O'Kelly Chapel
Road was determined to be an excessive mitigation. Therefore, an additional eastbound left-
turn lane was considered. The provision of an additional left-turn lane will reduce the overall

intersection delay in the PM peak period to less than that shown in the Background (2013)
conditions. Therefore, the following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

   ·   Provide an additional 100' eastbound left-turn lane with appropriate taper.

With this mitigation, the intersection still operates at a LOS F in the PM peak period; however,
the overall intersection delay is less than that experienced in the Background (2013)
conditions.

Intersection of NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
This intersection operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period
in the Combined (2013) conditions with increased delay in both peak periods from the
Background (2013) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay
time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone.             Therefore, the following mitigation is
recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

   ·   Provide an exclusive 300' eastbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper

With this mitigation, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS D, in both
the AM and PM peak periods and with less intersection delay than experienced in the
Background (2013) conditions.

Intersection of O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road
This offset intersection has one movement, the shared northbound left and right-turn, that
operates at LOS F in both the AM and PM peak periods. This intersection also has one
movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS
F in the PM peak period. Both of these movements operate with increased delay in both the
AM and PM peak periods when compared to the Background (2013) conditions. Based on
Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. The CTP identifies the need for realignment of this intersection
and several TARs have previously recommended realigning and signalizing this intersection,
but to our knowledge, no funding has been made available. A signal warrant analysis was
performed for this intersection and is located in Appendix I. Based on the warrant analysis,
the intersection will meet the peak hour signal warrants. While meeting one signal warrant
does not guarantee the installation of a signal, the intersection was analyzed as a signalized
intersection in the Combined Improved conditions. The recommended mitigation is that the
existing offset intersection of Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road be
realigned to form a single four-leg intersection and signalized (if approved by the Town of
Cary and NCDOT) in order to meet APFO requirements. This improvement resulted in
acceptable level of service operations. The recommended laneage at this intersection to
meet the APFO is as follows:

   ·   Southbound ­ One left-turn lane with 250 feet of full storage and appropriate taper,
       one through lane, and one full right-turn lane
   ·   Eastbound ­ One shared left-turn, through and right-turn lane
   ·   Westbound ­ One left-turn lane with 175 feet of full storage with appropriate taper and
       one shared through and right-turn lane (this movement was analyzed under permitted
       conditions)

Intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Access 1
This intersection has one movement, the southbound right-turn, that operates at LOS F in the
AM peak period with increased delay from the Background (2013) conditions. Based on
Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. The following mitigation is recommended at this intersection in
order to meet the APFO requirements:

   ·   Provide a westbound right-turn lane with 175 feet of full storage and appropriate taper

With the provision of a westbound right-turn lane, the southbound right-turn movement still
operates at LOS F in the AM peak period, but with less delay than experienced in the
Background (2013) conditions. This mitigation also meets NCDOT's nomograph criteria and
since McCrimmon Parkway is maintained by NCDOT, the right-turn lane may also be
required by NCDOT. The storage distance (175') is based on the NCDOT nomograph (found
in Appendix I).

Intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2
This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in the
AM peak period with increased delay from the Background (2013) conditions. Based on
Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. A peak hour signal warrant analysis was performed for this
intersection but the results indicate that the peak hour warrant is not met. Therefore, the
following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's APFO and NCDOT's turn lane
requirements:

   ·   Restrict southbound approach to provide one right-turn lane only (APFO requirement)
   ·   Provide a westbound right-turn lane with 175 feet of full storage and appropriate taper
       (NCDOT nomograph, Appendix I). It should be noted that this mitigation is not
       required per the APFO.

With just the provision of a westbound right-turn lane, the southbound left-turn movement still
operates at LOS F with Synchro unable to report the delay, and an increased volume to
capacity ratio as compared to the Background (2013) condition. With the intersection
reconfiguration of the southbound approach to prohibit left-turns, the southbound movement

operates at improved level of service, LOS B, in the AM peak period with less delay than
experienced by the southbound left-turns in the Background (2013) conditions. Vehicles
wishing to make this restricted movement can be accommodated by making a U-turn at the
downstream intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Cary Glen Boulevard, approximately
1,900 feet to the west. It should be noted that the field investigation for this TAR was
conducted on a weekday afternoon, and coincided with the end of the school day.
Considerable queuing was observed on the southbound approach of this intersection. A
large number of vehicles were also observed to make the right-turn and subsequent U-turn
maneuver due to heavy southbound left-turn queuing. Therefore this recommendation was
considered in-line with the operations of this intersection during peak hours.

Intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard
This intersection has one movement, the southbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in both
the AM and PM peak periods with increased delay from the Background (2013) conditions.
Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for movements at
unsignalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base
Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to
meet the APFO requirements.

Several geometric improvements were considered, such as exclusive turn lanes, but they did
not provide the necessary improvement in delay. Therefore, due to the increase in delay for
a movement operating at LOS F, an evaluation of peak hour signal warrants was performed
and is included in Appendix I. The peak hour signal warrant evaluation indicates this
intersection will meet peak hour warrants in the Combined (2013) scenario. According to the
Town of Cary, a signal warrant analysis has recently been performed and agreed upon by
NCDOT. Additionally, several other TARs have also recommended signalization of this
intersection. Based on this and the APFO requirements, the recommended mitigation is that
the a signal be installed at the intersection of Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen
Boulevard in order to meet APFO requirements. This intersection was analyzed as a two-
phase signalized intersection in the Combined Improved conditions, which resulted in overall
LOS A operations with all movements operating at LOS A in the AM and PM peak periods.

A summary of the intersection levels of service with mitigation is found in Tables 8a and 8b
below.

   Table 9a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the 2013 Background, 2013
   Combined, and 2013 Combined and Improved conditions. The results provided in Table 9a
   show that with the recommended mitigations, the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
   intersection and the NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection meet the
   requirements of the APFO. Table 9a also shows that all other signalized intersections
   operate at LOS D or better in all scenarios and do not require mitigation to meet APFO
   requirements.

Table 9b provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersections in the 2013 Background,
2013 Combined, and 2013 Combined and Improved conditions. As indicated in Table 9b, the
O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road intersection, the McCrimmon Parkway
and Access 1 intersection, the McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2 intersection, and the
Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard intersection all do not meet the APFO
requirements. With the provision of a signal, the O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level
Church Road intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS B in the PM
peak period. Also with the provision of a signal, the Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary
Glen Boulevard intersection operates at an overall LOS A in the AM and PM peak periods.
With the provision of a westbound right-turn lane at the McCrimmon Parkway Access 1
intersection, the southbound right-turn movement still operates at LOS F, but with 43.5
seconds per vehicle less delay than in the Background (2013) conditions. Additionally, the
restriction of the southbound approach at the McCrimmon Parkway and Access 2 intersection
to right-turn only movements results in LOS B operations for the southbound movement in the
AM peak period and the downstream U-turn operates at LOS A with the additional traffic from
Access 2. Each of these four intersections show an improvement compared to 2013
Background and 2013 Combined conditions and satisfies the requirements of the Town of
Cary's APFO. The proposed build laneage in 2013 for the proposed Panther Creek High
School Expansion is shown on Figure 9.

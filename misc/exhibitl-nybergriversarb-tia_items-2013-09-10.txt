EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CenterCal Properties, LLC is proposing to redevelop a portion of an existing Tualatin retail center
located in the northwest quadrant of the I-5/Nyberg Road interchange. The redevelopment, known as
Nyberg Rivers, will consist of a reconfiguration of portions of the larger existing shopping center site.
The redevelopment plan includes demolition of existing buildings, construction of new retail pads, and
the relocation of some existing uses. In addition, several access changes will be made to the site to
better accommodate the estimated traffic volumes being generated by the redevelopment. When
complete, the proposed redeveloped plan will consist of a maximum total of 307,000 square feet of
retail space.

The transportation analysis demonstrates that the proposed Nyberg Rivers redevelopment project can
be constructed while maintaining acceptable traffic operations and safety at the study intersections
within the immediate site vicinity, assuming provision of the recommended mitigation measures.


FINDINGS

Year 2012 Existing Conditions
                All of the study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday p.m. and
                Saturday midday peak hours with the exception of the SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert
                Street and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road intersections.
                   At both the SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Street and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert
                   Street intersections, the southbound approach during the weekday p.m. peak hour
                   operates at LOS F.


Year 2014 Background Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to operate acceptably during the weekday p.m.
                and Saturday midday peak hours with the exception of SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert
                Road and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road intersections.
                   At both the SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Street and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert
                   Street intersections, the southbound approach during the weekday p.m. peak hour is
                   forecast to continue to operate at LOS F. These findings are consistent with analysis
                   conducted as part of the recent Tualatin Transportation System Plan (TSP) Update and
                   future improvements are identified within the TSP for both of these intersections.

Nyberg Rivers                                                                                            April 2013
                                                                                                Executive Summary


Proposed Redevelopment Plan
                Under the redevelopment plan, the existing SW 75th Avenue connection to SW Nyberg Road
                will be closed to improve access management along SW Nyberg Road and to better
                accommodate the redevelopment proposal.
                The existing signalized access on SW Nyberg Road that currently serves the shopping center
                and the adjacent Fred Meyer site will remain. However, the following changes are proposed
                in order to better accommodate the proposed redevelopment, provide additional capacity
                for future growth in traffic, and improve safety relative to the existing condition:
                   A westbound right-turn lane will be developed on SW Nyberg Road to enhance access to
                   the site and minimize vehicle queuing on SW Nyberg Road.
                   The existing site driveway is proposed to be widened as shown in the proposed site
                   plan. This widening will include dual southbound left-turn lanes, a shared through/right-
                   turn lane, and dual in-bound receiving lanes. A raised median will be constructed in the
                   driveway throat to reduce turning conflicts on-site turning maneuvers and manage
                   vehicle queues on the approach to the signal.
                   The north and south approach signal phasing is proposed to be modified from
                   permissive left-turn phasing to split phasing.
                With the anticipated mix of new retail uses, the proposed redevelopment is estimated to
                generate 405 net new trips during the weekday p.m. peak hour and 725 net new trips
                during the Saturday midday peak hour.


Year 2014 Total Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections within the immediate site vicinity, including the site access
                points and internal site intersections, are forecast to operate acceptably during the
                weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours.
                The SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Road and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road
                intersections are forecast to continue to operate at LOS F.
                   o The proposed development will have an insignificant impact at either intersection,
                     resulting in an estimated 1.6% and 0.6% increase, respectively, during the weekday
                     p.m. peak hour.
                   o The Tualatin TSP has identified mitigations for these two intersections that, when
                     implemented, will address the long-term operations.
                   o The Washington County Transportation Development Tax (TDT) in part funds an
                     improvement project on SW Sagert Street that will add capacity and reduce delay to
                     both intersections.
                Beyond the site's frontage along SW Tualatin Sherwood Road and SW Martinazzi Avenue,
                where significant transportation improvements are proposed (including implementing the

                                                         3                               Kittelson & Associates, Inc.
Nyberg Rivers                                                                                               April 2013
                                                                                                   Executive Summary


                intent of the City's Loop Road), the project will have an insignificant impact on the other
                study intersections (generally resulting in less than a two percent increase in traffic relative
                to 2014 background conditions).
                At all signalized intersections beyond the site frontage (with the exception of the I-5
                interchange), the project will add on average one vehicle or less per signal cycle to any
                movement. This level of impact is less than significant by any traffic engineering standard
                and well below the level that would be perceived by motorists.
                Anticipated vehicle queues can be accommodated at the I-5 ramp terminals and the SW
                Nyberg Road/Signalized site driveway.
                The proposed Nyberg Rivers redevelopment project has proposed an on-site roadway
                network that will meet the intent of the loop road connection. The proposal includes the
                following:
                    o A new roadway connection to SW Boones Ferry Road (shown as "Street A" in Figure
                      2) that includes sidewalks.
                    o An enhanced site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road that will better accommodate
                      vehicular queuing and demand.
                    o A potential future (assuming the City desires to move forward) new site-access
                      connection to SW Martinazzi Avenue that aligns across from SW Seneca Street. This
                      connection would be the Seneca Street extension envisioned in the Town Center
                      Plan. Prior to the City making a decision on any new SW Street Seneca alignment,
                      the redevelopment site plan preserves this connection opportunity in the present or
                      future.
                    o The preservation of east-west and north-south travel ways that will provide
                      vehicular and pedestrian access between Street A, the Seneca Street
                      alignment/extension, and enhanced access to SW Nyberg Road.
                    o New sidewalks along the enhanced site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road that
                      provide pedestrian connections to the integrated site circulation network.
                    o New bikeway connections along the perimeter of the site.


SW Martinazzi Avenue and SW Boones Ferry Road Site Access Alternatives
                An alternative site access scenario was evaluated that demonstrates the impact of
                potentially adding a fourth leg (in the form of a site-access driveway) to the existing SW
                Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection and closing the existing SW Martinazzi
                Avenue site driveway adjacent to the library. This analysis produced the following results:
                    The east and west approaches to a modified SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street
                    intersection would operate at Level of Service (LOS) F and over capacity during the



                                                           4                                Kittelson & Associates, Inc.
Nyberg Rivers                                                                                            April 2013
                                                                                                Executive Summary


                   weekday p.m. peak hour with the addition of a fourth site-access leg. Signalizing the
                   intersection would provide the following:
                           o Mitigation that results in LOS A or better (a significant improvement over
                             existing conditions).
                           o Additional excess intersection capacity beyond what is needed to serve the
                             Nyberg Rivers project traffic.
                           o Enhanced east-west pedestrian connectivity across SW Martinazzi Avenue.
                           o A safety improvement relative to stop sign control.

                In addition to the modified SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection, another
                site-access alternative was evaluated that demonstrates the impacts of adding a limited
                access site-driveway to SW Boones Ferry Road. The analysis shows that with a direct
                connection to SW Boones Ferry Road, there would be some shifting of site-generated traffic
                off of SW Martinazzi Avenue. This additional access would further improve connectivity,
                help implement the City's loop road concept, and provide additional capacity beyond what
                is needed to serve the Nyberg Rivers project.


RECOMMENDATIONS
                With the proposed Nyberg Rivers redevelopment:
                   The existing SW 75th Avenue site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road should be closed
                   in order to minimize turning movement conflicts, allow for the construction of a
                   westbound right-turn lane at the SW Nyberg Road/signalized site driveway, and improve
                   the interchange access spacing conditions along SW Nyberg Road.
                   To better accommodate the anticipated site-generated traffic at the SW Nyberg
                   Road/Signalized site driveway:
                           o A new westbound right-turn lane should be constructed on SW Nyberg
                             Road.
                           o The site driveway should be modified to include dual southbound left-turn
                             lanes, a shared through/right-turn lane, and two inbound receiving lanes.
                           o The existing north/south traffic signal phasing should be modified from
                             permissive phasing to split phasing. Right-turn overlap phasing should be
                             provided for the westbound right-turn movement into the Nyberg Rivers
                             site.
                If site access to SW Martinazzi Avenue is provided via a new fourth leg to the SW Martinazzi
                Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection, the intersection should be signalized.
                If a new site access driveway is provided to SW Boones Ferry Road, the driveway should
                limited to right-in/right-out only access.

INTRODUCTION

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
CenterCal Properties, LLC is proposing to redevelop a portion of the existing Tualatin shopping center
located in the northwest quadrant of the I-5/Nyberg Road interchange. The existing shopping center
has been anchored by K-Mart and includes an assortment of other supporting retail uses such as drive-
thru banks, fast-food restaurants, and small to medium miscellaneous retailers. The Tualatin City Hall
and Library is also located within the boundary of the shopping center site, but on its own legal lot of
record and in separate ownership than the shopping center. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the site
in relationship to the larger regional vicinity.

In an effort to enhance and reinvigorate the existing shopping center, CenterCal is proposing to
redevelop the center as shown in Figure 2. Known as the Nyberg Rivers project, the full redevelopment
vision will entail the following components:

                The existing 96,799 square foot former K-Mart building will be removed.
                The existing 3,500 square foot building currently occupied by a Wendy's will be relocated to
                a new pad within the shopping center site.
                All other existing buildings will remain and it has been assumed that the existing tenants will
                continue to operate as-is for the foreseeable future.
                While a specific tenant mix is still being developed by CenterCal, it is envisioned that the
                redevelopment will include a large retailer and an assortment of small and medium-sized
                retail/restaurant uses. For the purposes of this traffic study, it has been assumed that this
                mix of uses will total approximately 245,456 square feet of new leasable area bringing the
                total net leasable square footage for the entire shopping center to 307,000.
                The existing SW 75th Avenue access to SW Nyberg Road is proposed to be closed.
                The existing signalized access on SW Nyberg Road that currently serves the shopping center
                will remain and continue to serve as the main entrance.
                All other shopping center driveways located off of SW Nyberg Road and SW Martinazzi
                Avenue will remain.
                While not required under this proposal, in consultation and cooperation with the City of
                Tualatin, the existing SW Martinazzi Avenue driveway (adjacent to the library/city hall)
                could close and alternative access could be provided via a new driveway across from SW
                Seneca Street. This option would only be pursued if it was with the mutual agreement of
                the City and on a timeline acceptable to the City.
Redevelopment construction is expected to begin in 2013 and with completion and full occupancy
anticipated in 2014.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.

Kittelson & Associates, Inc. (KAI) staff visited and inventoried the proposed Nyberg Rivers
redevelopment site and surrounding study area. At that time, KAI collected information regarding site
conditions, adjacent land uses, existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in the study area.


SITE CONDITIONS AND ADJACENT LAND USES
As shown in Figure 1, the existing shopping center is located in the northwest quadrant of the I-
5/Nyberg Road interchange in Tualatin. The shopping center is bounded by Nyberg Road to the south, I-
5 to the east, SW Martinazzi Avenue to the west, and Boones Ferry Road/Tualatin River to the north.
The shopping center currently consists of an unoccupied former K-Mart, two drive-thru banks, a fast-
food restaurant, and an assortment of retail uses. In addition, the Tualatin City Hall, city administrative
offices, and public library are located in the northwest portion of the shopping center site on City-
owned property and a separate legal lot of record.


TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Table 1 identifies the characteristics of key roadways located within the vicinity of the redevelopment
site. Figure 3a identifies the existing lane configurations and traffic control devices at all of the study
intersections while Figure 3b identifies the study area roadway ownership.

TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
In late May 2012 (while local schools were still in session), manual turning-movement counts were
obtained for the all the study intersections and site driveways located within the immediate vicinity of
the shopping center. In addition, traffic count data collected as part of the on-going Tualatin
Transportation System Plan Update were utilized for all of the other study intersections1. Figures 4a and
4b provide a summary of the existing turning-movement counts, which are rounded to the nearest five
vehicles per hour for the weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours. Appendix "B" contains the
traffic count worksheets used in this study.

                                                                                               Existing Conditions


Operational Standards
Level of service (LOS) and volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio are the two performance measures utilized by
the affected review agencies for determining intersection operations. A description of each is outlined
below.

Level of Service
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. A description of level of service and the criteria by which
they are determined is presented in Appendix "C". Appendix "C" also indicates how level of service is
measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service. The City of Tualatin
has adopted level-of-service standards for signalized and unsignalized intersections. LOS "D" is
considered acceptable at signalized intersections and LOS "E" is considered acceptable at an
unsignalized intersections.

V/C Ratio
The V/C ratio is a measure of an intersection's theoretical capacity. As the V/C ratio approaches 1.0,
vehicle congestion worsens and the intersection becomes less capable of accommodating the vehicular
demand. For all of the Washington County study intersections, the maximum acceptable V/C ratio is
0.99 during the first hour and 0.90 during second hour. For the ODOT study intersections, the minimum
acceptable V/C ratio is 0.99.

All intersection level-of-service evaluations used the peak 15-minute flow rate during the weekday p.m.
and Saturday midday peak hours. Using the peak 15-minute flow rate ensures that this analysis is based
on a reasonable worst-case scenario. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely
to occur for 15 minutes out of each average peak hour. The transportation system will likely operate
under conditions better than those described in this report during all other time periods.

Figures 4a, 4b, and Table 2 summarize the operational performance for the study intersections under
the existing peak hour conditions. As shown, all of the study intersections currently operate at
acceptable levels of service and V/C ratios during the peak hours with the exception of the SW
Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Road and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road intersections. Appendix "D"
includes the operational worksheets under year 2012 existing traffic conditions.

SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Street
The SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Street intersection is an all-way stop-controlled intersection. Based on
the existing traffic demand, the intersection currently operates at LOS F conditions during the weekday
p.m. peak hour. These findings are consistent with the existing conditions analysis prepared as part of
the recent update to the Tualatin Transportation System Plan (TSP).


SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Road
The SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Street intersection is an all-way stop-controlled intersection.
Based on the existing traffic demand, the intersection currently operates at LOS F conditions during the
weekday p.m. peak hour. These findings are consistent with existing conditions analysis prepared as
part of the recent update to the Tualatin TSP.


Existing Daily Traffic Profile
A summation of daily traffic volumes was prepared at the request of the City of Tualatin. Using available
daily traffic volume counts collected by Washington County and those daily counts collected as part of
the on-going Tualatin Transportation System Plan Update, it was generally determined that the
weekday p.m. peak hour traffic volumes are approximately 8% of the daily traffic profile. Applying this
factor to the weekday p.m. peak hour turning movement volumes collected at the study area
intersections, daily traffic volume estimates were derived and summarized in Table 3.

SAFETY ANALYSIS
This section provides analysis of roadway safety information within the site vicinity. Three sources of
crash data were considered: the ODOT Safety Priority Index System, the Washington County Safety
Priority Indexing System (SPIS), and review of crash data provided by ODOT. The ODOT crash data
includes all reported crashes that occurred at the study intersections for the three-year period from
January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 (matching the Tualatin TSP Update review period).


ODOT Statewide Priority Index System
The Statewide Priority Index System (ODOT SPIS) is a method developed by ODOT for identifying
hazardous locations on state highways through consideration of crash frequency, crash rate, and crash
severity. The ODOT SPIS designates a roadway segment as a SPIS site if a location experiences three or
more crashes or one or more fatal crashes over a three-year period. Under this method, all state
highways are analyzed in 0.10 mile segments to identify SPIS sites. Statewide, there are approximately
6,000 SPIS sites. SPIS sites are typically intersections, but can also be roadway segments.

Within the study area, none of the ODOT controlled intersections or roadway segments are included in
ODOT's SPIS ranking program for 2009-2011.


Washington County Safety Priority Index System (SPIS)
Washington County ranks their high accident SPIS locations based on a formula that identifies
potentially hazardous locations. The formula takes into consideration the frequency, rate, and severity
of crashes.

Within the study area, there are two intersections that rank within the top 50 SPIS locations. These
include SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road/SW Boones Ferry Road and SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road/SW
Martinazzi Avenue.


Intersection Crash Data Analysis
The individual crash history of the study intersections was reviewed in an effort to identify potential
intersection safety issues. The crash types and crash rates from the analysis are presented in Table 4.
Typically, crash rates that meet or exceed 1.0 crashes per million entering vehicles are reviewed for
additional geometric and operational investigation. As shown in the table, all of the reported
intersections have crash rates less than 1.0. These findings are generally consistent with the crash
assessment provided in the Tualatin TSP Update.

TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The transportation impact analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will operate in
the year the proposed redevelopment is expected to be fully built and occupied (2014). The impact of
traffic generated by the proposed Nyberg Rivers development during the typical weekday p.m. and
Saturday midday peak hours was examined as follows:

                Background weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hour traffic conditions for the 2014
                (build-out year of the Nyberg Rivers redevelopment) was analyzed at each of the study
                intersections.
                Background conditions were developed by applying a 1.5-percent annual growth rate to the
                existing traffic volumes to account for regional growth in the site vicinity between years
                2012 and 2014.
                Site-generated trips were estimated for build-out of the site.
                Site trip-distribution patterns were derived from a review of existing traffic patterns and
                regional planning model outputs.
                Year 2014 (build-out year of the Nyberg Rivers redevelopment) total traffic conditions were
                analyzed at each of the study intersections and site-access points during the weekday p.m.
                and Saturday midday peak hours.
                On-site circulation issues and site-access alternatives were evaluated.


YEAR 2014 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The year 2014 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will
operate without the proposed Nyberg Rivers redevelopment. This analysis includes traffic attributed to
general growth in the region, but does not include traffic from the proposed redevelopment.


Traffic Volumes
In order to develop a near-term traffic growth rate, the last five years of annual Washington County
daily traffic counts were reviewed along SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road (just east of SW Boones Ferry
Road) and SW Nyberg Road (west of SW 65th Avenue). A summary of these counts is provided in Table 5
below.

As shown in the table, traffic growth within the general site vicinity between 2008 and 2012 has been
minimal to negative, in part reflecting the economic slowdown that occurred after 2008. City staff
recommended a 1.5% annual growth rate be applied to reflect a reasonable, yet conservative
approximation of traffic growth at each of the study intersections. This growth rate is consistent with
other traffic studies that have been submitted in the past within the project vicinity. Figures 5a and 5b
illustrate the resulting forecast year 2014 background traffic volumes during the weekday p.m. and
Saturday midday peak hours.


2014 Background Operations Analysis
The weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak-hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figure 5a and
5b were used to conduct an operational analysis at each study intersection to determine the year 2014
background traffic levels of service. As indicated by the respective figures and Table 6, the background
traffic analysis determined that all of but two of the study intersections are forecast to operate at
acceptable standards during both the weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours. Appendix "E"
contains the year 2014 background traffic level-of-service worksheets.


SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Street
Based on the estimated future traffic demand, the intersection is forecast to continue to operate at LOS
F conditions during the weekday p.m. peak hour.


SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Road
Based on the existing traffic demand, the intersection is forecast to continue to operate at LOS F
conditions during the weekday p.m. peak hour.

PROPOSED REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
In an effort to enhance and reinvigorate the existing shopping center, CenterCal is proposing to
redevelop a portion of the existing center. The redevelopment is envisioned to entail the following:

                 The 96,799 square foot former K-Mart building will be removed.
                 The existing 3,500 square foot building currently occupied by a Wendy's will be relocated to
                 a new pad within the shopping center site.
                 All other existing buildings (and associated access driveways) will remain as it has been
                 assumed that the existing tenants will continue to operate as-is for the foreseeable future.
                 While a specific tenant mix is still being developed by CenterCal, it is envisioned that the
                 redeveloped portion of the center will include large and medium sized retailers and an
                 assortment of smaller retail/restaurant uses. For the purposes of this traffic study, it has

                                                                       29                                   Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

                                                                                      Transportation Impact Analysis


                been assumed that this mix of uses will total approximately 245,456 square feet of new
                leasable area bringing the total net leasable area for the entire shopping center to 307,000
                square feet.
In order to enhance access to the redeveloped shopping center, several modifications to the existing
shopping center driveways are proposed. These include the following:

                The existing SW 75th Avenue connection to SW Nyberg Road is proposed to be closed under
                the redevelopment plan. This closure will minimize turning movement conflicts along a busy
                segment of SW Nyberg Road and it will improve the interchange access spacing conditions
                within the I-5/Nyberg Interchange influence area.
                The existing signalized access on SW Nyberg Road that serves the shopping center and the
                adjacent Fred Meyer site will remain at its current location; however, the following changes
                are proposed to increase intersection capacity:
                   A westbound right-turn lane is proposed on SW Nyberg Street to enhance access to the
                   site and minimize vehicle queuing on SW Nyberg Street.
                   The existing site driveway is proposed to be widened as shown in the site plan to
                   accommodate increased site traffic. This widening will include dual southbound left-turn
                   lanes, a shared through/right-turn lane, and dual in-bound receiving lanes (See the
                   "Impacts of the Nyberg Rivers Development on Identified Transportation Planning
                   Projects" section for further discussion on these improvements).
                   The north and south approach signal phasing is proposed to be modified from
                   permissive left-turn phasing to split phasing. Westbound right-turn overlap phasing is
                   proposed for the westbound right-turn lane into the Nyberg Rivers site.
                   No modifications are proposed to the existing Fred Meyer driveway at this intersection.
Figure 6 shows the proposed site-access configurations and traffic control devices that will be assumed
as part of the total traffic analysis. Construction of this development is expected to begin in 2013 with
the build-out projected to occur in year 2014.

Redevelopment Plan Trip Generation
Given that the proposed project is only a partial redevelopment of the larger shopping center; a trip
generation methodology was developed to reflect the characteristics of a unified and vibrant shopping
center. The following outline describes the trip generation methodology that was used:

                Traffic counts were conducted at all of the site driveways to quantify the trip generation
                profile of the existing retail and civic uses currently operating on the site.
                Recognizing that the City offices/library are not retail uses and the layout of the site/parking
                fields prevents an accurate quantification of trips being generated by these uses, estimates
                were developed using the standard reference manual, Trip Generation, published by the
                Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The Library and Single Tenant Office Building
                land uses were used in the estimate process. The resulting estimates were then subtracted
                from the existing site driveway counts to produce a trip profile estimate for the existing
                158,343 square feet of retail building space at the site.
                A trip generation rate was calculated using the Shopping Center land use in ITE Trip
                Generation for the 245,4562 square feet of new retail use plus the 61,544 square feet of
                remaining retail uses3.
                The existing site retail traffic estimate was then subtracted from the total shopping center
                and office trip generation estimate to arrive at a total trip estimate for the net increase in
                shopping center and office square footage. A pass-by rate reduction of 34%4 was assumed
                for the shopping center component to generate the net new trip estimate for the site. This
                pass-by estimate is consistent with ITE Trip Generation for similar shopping center uses.
                Furthermore, given the mix of existing uses (fast-food restaurants, drive-thru banks, and
                shopping center commercial uses) that will remain on the site and proposed mix of uses
                (large and medium sized general retailers and assortment of general retail/restaurant uses),
                this pass-by reduction rate is considered to be reasonable and conservatively appropriate.


2
    New Retail Uses = Total Proposed Area ­ Existing Uses that Remain = 307,000 sq. ft. ­ 61,544 sq. ft. = 245,456 sq. ft.

3
    Remaining uses = Existing building area ­ Existing Kmart = 158,343 sq. ft. - 96,799 sq. ft. = 61,544 sq. ft.)

4
    There are approximately 55,000-60,000 vehicles per day passing by the site frontage on SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road
and SW Martinazzi Avenue. This volume is considered sufficient to justify the standard 34 percent pass-by assumption
for the shopping center (the average 34 percent was obtained directly from the Institute of Transportation Engineers
                           th
(ITE) Trip Generation, 9 Edition). It is also expected that some trips will re-route from I-5, which would be considered
"diverted trips". All trips coming from I-5 were considered "primary" trips in an effort to present a conservative and
reasonable worst-case condition. ITE Trip Generation Shopping Center trip rates indicate that an average 26 percent of
shopping center trips are diverted, in addition to the 34 percent pass-by. By not accounting for diverted trips, the
current study is inherently conservative and likely overstates impacts between the main site driveway and the I-5
interchange ramps.

  The City Hall traffic counts were estimated using the Single Tenant Office Building land use in ITE Trip Generation. The existing
 City Hall square footage was estimated to be approximately 10,000 square feet in size.

  Includes the 158,343 square feet of existing shopping center (minus the 96,799 square foot former K-Mart) plus the 245,456
 square feet of proposed shopping center uses.




As shown in Table 8, the proposed redevelopment project is anticipated to generate approximately 405
net new weekday p.m. peak hour trips and 725 net new Saturday midday peak hour trips.


Site Trip Distribution/Trip Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the proposed redevelopment project was estimated based on a review
of existing traffic patterns and a select zone assignment obtained from Washington County's travel
demand model. A summary output sheet from the travel demand model and the distribution
calculations derived from it is provided in the first part of Appendix F. The trip distribution pattern used
in the analysis is shown in Figure 7.

The estimated site-generated trips were assigned to the network by distributing the trips shown in
Table 8 according to the trip distribution pattern shown in Figure 7. Figures 8aA/8aPB and 8bA/8bBP
illustrate the site-generated/pass-by trips that are expected to use the roadway system during the
weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours.


YEAR 2014 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area's transportation system will operate
with the traffic generated by the Nyberg Rivers redevelopment plan. The year 2014 background traffic
volumes for the weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours (shown in Figure 5a and 5b) were
added to the site-generated traffic (shown in Figures 8aA/8aPB and 8bA/8bPB) to arrive at the total
traffic volumes that are shown in Figures 9a and 9b.


2014 Total Traffic Operations
The weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figures 9a and
9b were used to conduct an operational analysis at each study intersection and site driveway to
determine the year 2014 total traffic operations. The results of the total traffic analysis shown in
Figures 9a, 9b, and Table 9 indicate that all of the study intersections and site access points, except for
the SW 65th Avenue/SW Sager Road and SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Road intersections, are
forecast to operate at acceptable operations during the weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak
hours. Appendix "F" contains the year 2014 total traffic level-of-service worksheets.

The SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Road and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road intersections are
forecast to continue to operate at LOS F. The proposed development is estimated to contribute an
additional 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively, during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Given this small increase,
no development-driven traffic mitigation is recommended for the following reasons:

                The Tualatin TSP has identified mitigations for these two intersections that, when
                implemented, will address the long-term operations.
                The Washington County Transportation Development Tax (TDT) in part funds an
                improvement project on SW Sagert Street that will add capacity and reduce delay to both
                intersections.

  * Results reported reflect SW Martinazzi Avenue and SW Boones Ferry Road Site Access Alternatives discussed beginning on page 45.
  For intersections #4, #5, #6, and #7, it is recognized that the operational results shown may differ slightly due to the presence of vehicle
  queuing along SW Martinazzi Avenue during peak time periods.
  Existing and background conditions along the Tualatin-Sherwood corridor between the I-5 ramp terminals and Boones Ferry Road reflect
  consistent timing parameters due to the limited change in traffic volumes. Under the total conditions, with the new site traffic, timing
  parameters have been optimized in a more focused effort to approximate the SCATS adaptive system's response to the new traffic. The
  difference in timing optimization levels contributes to the variation in performance between background and total conditions.

Queuing Analysis
A 95th percentile vehicle queuing analysis was performed at the I-5 off-ramps and the SW Nyberg
Road/Signalized site driveway. Per ODOT requirements, the ramp terminal queuing was assessed using
SimTraffic software5. The queuing analysis was completed in accordance with the assumptions
stipulated in the ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual (APM).

Each vehicle was assumed to occupy 25 feet. Table 11 summarizes the queuing analysis at the study
intersections for the 2014 total traffic conditions (critical weekday p.m. peak hour). All queues reported


5
     Tualatin-Sherwood Road between the I-5 ramp terminals and Teton Avenue currently operates with an adaptive
signal system (TransCore SCATSTM), which adjusts cycle length, green splits and offsets to match capacity to traffic
demands. This traffic analysis approximated the SCATS system using an upper-end cycle length based on the existing
logs from the SCATS system, provided by Washington County. The Synchro/SimTraffic analysis is still a static
representation of the adaptive system, thus better than reported results for delay and queue lengths are expected due

 Storage length is framed by the portion of the freeway off-ramp needed to bring a vehicle to a full stop from the posted freeway speed (55 mph) at
a deceleration rate of 6.5 feet/second2. Ramp length is approximately 1,200 feet long with a deceleration distance of approximately 500 feet.



Table 11 shows that adequate storage exists for the forecast 95th percentile queues at the identified

SW Martinazzi Avenue and SW Boones Ferry Road Site Access Alternatives
As part of this study, a separate site access alternative was evaluated that includes the following
options:

                 Adding a fourth leg (in the form of a site-access driveway) to the existing SW Martinazzi
                 Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection and closing the existing SW Martinazzi Avenue site
                 driveway adjacent to the library6. For initial evaluation purposes, it was assumed that the
                 modified intersection would be stop-controlled on the east-west Seneca Street approaches




6
    It should be noted that this site-access is not required to mitigate for any impacts from the proposed development.
Rather, it was evaluated in the event the City determined that it had a desire to reconfigure its property and therefore
realign the access. Such realignment is not immediately required and can await the City's preferred timeline for
redevelopment of its site. For the purposes of analyzing this scenario, it was assumed that the City buildings would be
relocated somewhere within the existing shopping center site to ensure that this transportation impact analysis
accounted for the trips associated with those uses.


                                                                           44                                                Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

                and the new westbound approach would have a separate left- and shared through-right
                lane.
                Adding a new site driveway that would connect to SW Boones Ferry Road (identified as the
                Street "A" connection in Figure 2). Given the limited site frontage along SW Boones Ferry
                Road, the nearby SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Boones Ferry Road intersection, and the
                nearby Tualatin River Bridge, it was assumed that this driveway connection would be limited
                to right-in/right-out access.
Figure 10 shows the assumed site-access configurations and traffic control devices associated with
these site-access alternatives. Figures 11a and 11b summarize the resulting intersection operations for
the weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours.

As shown in the Figure 11a, both the eastbound and westbound left-turn volumes at the modified SW
Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection are forecast to operate at LOS F and over capacity
during the weekday p.m. peak hour conditions under this alternative. Based on these conditions, a
traffic signal with permissive left-turn phasing was evaluated as a potential mitigation measure. Table
12 summarizes the resulting operations for the weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours.

        Permissive left-turn phasing was assumed on all approaches.



Table 12 indicates that signalization of the intersection will mitigate the LOS F conditions under the
previously assumed two-way stop-controlled approach on SW Seneca Street. Appendix "G" contains the
year 2014 total traffic operations worksheets for the alternative access scenario at SW Martinazzi
Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection. As indicated in Table 12, a traffic signal at the SW Martinazzi
Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection provides a significant capacity and safety benefit. In particular,
signalization would:

                  Provide additional excess capacity compared to an unsignalized east-west stop-controlled
                  intersection.
                  Enhance east-west pedestrian movements by providing a signalized crossing where one
                  does not exist today.
From a signal operations standpoint, progression along SW Martinazzi Avenue is constrained by the
endpoints of SW Tualatin-Sherwood Road and SW Boones Ferry. Operational analysis indicates a new
signal at Seneca and the existing signal at SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Boones Ferry Road could operate
well during the peak period as a fully actuated, uncoordinated signal. Queuing should be monitored,
particularly for other time periods to determine if including one or both of these signals into the
adaptive signal system would be advantageous. Note, the new signal at Seneca provides much needed
queue management on SW Martinazzi (as seen in SimTraffic modeling) to facilitate traffic flows and
represents a large improvement over the no-build conditions for the assumed 2014 traffic demand.

In addition to the modified SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection, Figures 11a and 11b
demonstrate the impacts of adding a limited access site-driveway to SW Boones Ferry Road (Street "A"
connection). The analysis shows that the driveway would provide a direct connection to SW Boones
Ferry Road, but that it would not provide an operational benefit to any other study intersection of site
driveway beyond the base site layout analysis.

IMPACTS OF THE NYBERG RIVERS DEVELOPMENT ON IDENTIFIED
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PROJECTS
Figure 1 of the current Tualatin Transportation System Plan (TSP) has identified a future minor collector
(Cb) roadway through the proposed Nyberg Rivers development area that would connect SW Nyberg
Road to SW Boones Ferry Road. The TSP does not identify a specific alignment for this roadway. The
Tualatin Town Center Plan subsequently identifies this connection as a "loop road" that would
conceptually extend from SW Boones Ferry Road around the Kmart building and internally connect with
a future Seneca Street extension from the west. The TSP and Town Center Plan do not specifically
address how or where the loop road would make the final connection to SW Nyberg Road.

The Nyberg Rivers redevelopment project has proposed an on-site roadway network that will meet the
intent of the loop road connection and completes the connection to SW Nyberg Road. While not
meeting all the specific design requirements called for in the City's proposed collector roadway
designation, offers the functionality and connectivity that would be provided by a fully developed
collector street system. The proposal includes the following:

                A new roadway connection to SW Boones Ferry Road (shown as "Street A" in Figure 2) that
                includes sidewalks.
                An enhanced site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road that will better accommodate
                vehicular queuing and demand.
                A potential future (assuming the City desires to move forward) new site-access connection
                to SW Martinazzi Avenue that aligns across from SW Seneca Street. This connection would
                be the Seneca Street extension envisioned in the Town Center Plan. Prior to the City making
                a decision on any new SW Street Seneca alignment, the redevelopment site plan preserves
                this connection opportunity in the present or future.
                The preservation of east-west and north-south travel ways that will provide vehicular and
                pedestrian access between Street A, the Seneca Street alignment/extension, and enhanced
                access to SW Nyberg Road.
                New sidewalks along the enhanced site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road that provide
                pedestrian connections to the integrated site circulation network.
                New bikeway connections along the perimeter of the site.
While all of these elements contribute towards the desired connectivity identified in the Tualatin TSP,
development to full city standards is difficult for the following reasons:

                The TSP and Town Center Plan do not specifically address how or where the loop road
                would connect to SW Nyberg Road, however the graphics suggest the connection would
                occur somewhere within the vicinity of the existing SW 75th Avenue connection to SW
                Nyberg Road. Based on current ODOT access management policies, it is recognized that
                ODOT would not allow such a connection to be made given that it would be within 200-300
                feet of the I-5 Southbound ramp terminal. Instead, it has been assumed that the existing SW

                                                                                       Transportation Impact Analysis


                Nyberg Road/signalized site driveway would represent the only access connection that
                ODOT would continue to support within the influence area of the interchange.
                The proposed Nyberg Rivers project is not a complete redevelopment of the existing
                shopping center site. A large number of existing uses (Michaels, US Bank, Banner Bank,
                Tualatin City Library and administrative offices, and other retail space) will remain on the
                site. As a result, much of the site layout (including buildings and parking areas) will remain
                substantially unchanged.
                   For example, the "loop road" concept in the Tualatin Town Center Plan suggested that
                   the conceptual connection occur around and behind the existing Kmart building. As
                   noted in the proposed development plan, this area of the site will be redeveloped with
                   retail pads. A limited site configuration for the placement of new buildings and a need
                   to maintain a sizable number of existing buildings/parking areas does not accommodate
                   a "loop road" alignment.

The results of this study indicate that the proposed Nyberg Rivers redevelopment project can be
constructed while maintaining acceptable traffic operations and safety at the study intersections,
assuming provision of the recommended mitigation measures.


FINDINGS

Year 2012 Existing Conditions
                All of the study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday p.m. and
                Saturday midday peak hours with the exception of the SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert
                Street and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road intersections.
                   At both the SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Street and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert
                   Street intersections, the southbound approach during the weekday p.m. peak hour
                   operates at LOS F.


Year 2014 Background Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections are forecast to operate acceptably during the weekday p.m.
                and Saturday midday peak hours with the exception of SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert
                Road and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road intersections.
                   At both the SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Street and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert
                   Street intersections, the southbound approach during the weekday p.m. peak hour is
                   forecast to continue to operate at LOS F. These findings are consistent with analysis
                   conducted as part of the recent Tualatin Transportation System Plan (TSP) Update and
                   future improvements are identified within the TSP for both of these intersections.


Proposed Redevelopment Plan
                Under the redevelopment plan, the existing SW 75th Avenue connection to SW Nyberg Road
                will be closed to improve access management along SW Nyberg Road and to better
                accommodate the redevelopment proposal.
                The existing signalized access on SW Nyberg Road that currently serves the shopping center
                and the adjacent Fred Meyer site will remain. However, the following changes are proposed
                in order to better accommodate the proposed redevelopment, provide additional capacity
                for future growth in traffic, and improve safety relative to the existing condition:
                   A westbound right-turn lane will be developed on SW Nyberg Road to enhance access to
                   the site and minimize vehicle queuing on SW Nyberg Road.

                   The existing site driveway is proposed to be widened as shown in the proposed site
                   plan. This widening will include dual southbound left-turn lanes, a shared through/right-
                   turn lane, and dual in-bound receiving lanes. A raised median will be constructed in the
                   driveway throat to reduce turning conflicts on-site turning maneuvers and manage
                   vehicle queues on the approach to the signal.
                   The north and south approach signal phasing is proposed to be modified from
                   permissive left-turn phasing to split phasing.
                With the anticipated mix of new retail uses, the proposed redevelopment is estimated to
                generate 405 net new trips during the weekday p.m. peak hour and 725 net new trips
                during the Saturday midday peak hour.


Year 2014 Total Traffic Conditions
                All of the study intersections within the immediate site vicinity, including the site access
                points and internal site intersections, are forecast to operate acceptably during the
                weekday p.m. and Saturday midday peak hours.
                The SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Sagert Road and SW 65th Avenue/SW Sagert Road
                intersections are forecast to continue to operate at LOS F.
                   o The proposed development will have an insignificant impact at either intersection,
                     resulting in an estimated 1.6% and 0.6% increase, respectively, during the weekday
                     p.m. peak hour.
                   o The Tualatin TSP has identified mitigations for these two intersections that, when
                     implemented, will address the long-term operations.
                   o The Washington County Transportation Development Tax (TDT) in part funds an
                     improvement project on SW Sagert Street that will add capacity and reduce delay to
                     both intersections.
                Beyond the site's frontage along SW Tualatin Sherwood Road and SW Martinazzi Avenue,
                where significant transportation improvements are proposed (including implementing the
                intent of the City's Loop Road), the project will have an insignificant impact on the other
                study intersections (generally resulting in less than a two percent increase in traffic relative
                to 2014 background conditions).
                At all signalized intersections beyond the site frontage (with the exception of the I-5
                interchange), the project will add on average one vehicle or less per signal cycle to any
                movement. This level of impact is less than significant by any traffic engineering standard
                and well below the level that would be perceived by motorists.
                Anticipated vehicle queues can be accommodated at the I-5 ramp terminals and the SW
                Nyberg Road/Signalized site driveway.

                The proposed Nyberg Rivers redevelopment project has proposed an on-site roadway
                network that will meet the intent of the loop road connection. The proposal includes the
                following:
                   o A new roadway connection to SW Boones Ferry Road (shown as "Street A" in Figure
                     2) that includes sidewalks.
                   o An enhanced site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road that will better accommodate
                     vehicular queuing and demand.
                   o A potential future (assuming the City desires to move forward) new site-access
                     connection to SW Martinazzi Avenue that aligns across from SW Seneca Street. This
                     connection would be the Seneca Street extension envisioned in the Town Center
                     Plan. Prior to the City making a decision on any new SW Street Seneca alignment,
                     the redevelopment site plan preserves this connection opportunity in the present or
                     future.
                   o The preservation of east-west and north-south travel ways that will provide
                     vehicular and pedestrian access between Street A, the Seneca Street
                     alignment/extension, and enhanced access to SW Nyberg Road.
                   o New sidewalks along the enhanced site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road that
                     provide pedestrian connections to the integrated site circulation network.
                   o New bikeway connections along the perimeter of the site.


SW Martinazzi Avenue and SW Boones Ferry Road Site Access Alternatives
                An alternative site access scenario was evaluated that demonstrates the impact of
                potentially adding a fourth leg (in the form of a site-access driveway) to the existing SW
                Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection and closing the existing SW Martinazzi
                Avenue site driveway adjacent to the library. This analysis produced the following results:
                   The east and west approaches to a modified SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street
                   intersection would operate at Level of Service (LOS) F and over capacity during the
                   weekday p.m. peak hour with the addition of a fourth site-access leg. Signalizing the
                   intersection would provide the following:
                           o Mitigation that results in LOS A or better (a significant improvement over
                             existing conditions).
                           o Additional excess intersection capacity beyond what is needed to serve the
                             Nyberg Rivers project traffic.
                           o Enhanced east-west pedestrian connectivity across SW Martinazzi Avenue.
                           o A safety improvement relative to stop sign control.

                                                                                   Conclusions and Recommendations


                In addition to the modified SW Martinazzi Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection, another
                site-access alternative was evaluated that demonstrates the impacts of adding a limited
                access site-driveway to SW Boones Ferry Road. The analysis shows that with a direct
                connection to SW Boones Ferry Road, there would be some shifting of site-generated traffic
                off of SW Martinazzi Avenue. This additional access would further improve connectivity,
                help implement the City's loop road concept, and provide additional capacity beyond what
                is needed to serve the Nyberg Rivers project.


RECOMMENDATIONS
                With the proposed Nyberg Rivers redevelopment:
                   The existing SW 75th Avenue site-access driveway to SW Nyberg Road should be closed
                   in order to minimize turning movement conflicts, allow for the construction of a
                   westbound right-turn lane at the SW Nyberg Road/signalized site driveway, and improve
                   the interchange access spacing conditions along SW Nyberg Road.
                   To better accommodate the anticipated site-generated traffic at the SW Nyberg
                   Road/Signalized site driveway:
                           o A new westbound right-turn lane should be constructed on SW Nyberg
                             Road.
                           o The site driveway should be modified to include dual southbound left-turn
                             lanes, a shared through/right-turn lane, and two inbound receiving lanes.
                           o The existing north/south traffic signal phasing should be modified from
                             permissive phasing to split phasing. Right-turn overlap phasing should be
                             provided for the westbound right-turn movement into the Nyberg Rivers
                             site.
                If site access to SW Martinazzi Avenue is provided via a new fourth leg to the SW Martinazzi
                Avenue/SW Seneca Street intersection, the intersection should be signalized.
                If a new site access driveway is provided to SW Boones Ferry Road, the driveway should
                limited to right-in/right-out only access.

From:        Matt Hughart, AICP; Chris Brehmer, P.E.; Mark Vandehey, P.E.
Project:     Nyberg Woods II ­ Tualatin, OR
Subject:     Proposed Traffic Study Scope of Work


The purpose of this memorandum is to provide an opportunity for the City of Tualatin, Washington
County, and ODOT staff to review and provide guidance on project assumptions associated with
conducting a traffic study for a proposed partial redevelopment of the existing K-Mart shopping
center in Tualatin, Oregon. Details of the proposed project assumptions are documented below.


Proposed Development Plan
The project entails a partial redevelopment of the existing shopping center currently anchored by a
K-Mart and supported by a number of other retail uses. While a specific site plan and tenant mix is
still being developed, the redevelopment will likely entail the following components:

            K-Mart will close and its existing 96,799 square foot building will be removed.

            The existing adult cabaret will close and its 4,800 square foot building will be removed.

            Approximately 208,180 square feet of new shopping center uses and 30,000 square feet
            of office space will be constructed on the site.

            The existing 3,500 square foot building currently occupied by a Wendy's will be relocated
            to a new pad within the shopping center site.

            All other existing buildings will remain and their uses will continue to operate as is.

            The existing 75th Avenue access to SW Nyberg Road is proposed to be closed.

                 The existing signalized access on SW Nyberg Road that currently serves the site and the
                 Fred Meyer site will remain. The traffic study will look at potential enhancements to this
                 intersection to better accommodate site traffic and vehicle queuing.

                 The traffic study will look at different access scenarios to SW Martinazzi Avenue and SW
                 Boones Ferry Road. Specifically, the impacts/improvements necessary to realign the
                 existing SW Martinazzi Avenue driveway (adjacent to the library/city hall) to access SW
                 Martinazzi Avenue across from Seneca Street and a new site access driveway to SW
                 Boones Ferry Road.


Proposed Study Intersections
A preliminary list of study intersections was identified based on the size of the anticipated
development and its location. This list of intersections is identified below. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate
their location and associated lane configurations/traffic control devices.

                 SW Nyberg Street/Signalized entrance to Nyberg Woods (#14)

In anticipation of the need to study these intersections at a minimum, traffic counts were obtained in
May 2012 (before the end of the spring school semester) during the analysis periods discussed in the
following section.

Traffic Analysis Periods and Scenarios
In order to assess the impact of the proposed development, traffic conditions are proposed to be
analyzed during the peak hour of the following time periods:

                 Weekday evening roadway peak hour (3:00-6:00 p.m.)

                 Saturday midday peak hour (11:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.)

The proposed redevelopment is anticipated to be completed by 2014. Intersections are proposed to
be analyzed for the following three time periods:

                 Existing (2012)

                 Background (without shopping center redevelopment) (2014)

                 Total Traffic (with shopping center redevelopment) (2014)


EXISTING CONDITIONS ANALYSIS
The existing operations will be assessed at the identified study intersections during the weekday
evening and Saturday midday peak periods using the traffic data collected. Synchro 8 analysis
software will be used in accordance with the methodology in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual and
the ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual (where applicable). The most recent 5-year crash data at each
study intersection will be obtained and reviewed.


BACKGROUND ANALYSIS
This analysis will assess traffic operations at the study intersections during the two study periods in
the year 2014 without any improvements or changes to the roadway network. Traffic volumes for the
year 2014 will be based on an assumed growth rate of 1.0% per year. This near-term growth rate was
derived from a review of Washington County traffic counts on Tualatin-Sherwood Road and Nyberg
Street. In-process development data will be obtained from the City of Tualatin and Washington
County and included as part of year 2014 forecast traffic volumes.


TRIP GENERATION
Given that the proposed project is only a partial redevelopment of the larger shopping center, a trip
generation methodology was developed that would more accurately reflect the characteristics of a
unified and vibrant shopping center. This methodology is outlined in greater detail in Appendix A.
The resulting trip estimate is summarized in Table 1 below.

 Includes the 158,343 square feet of existing shopping center (minus the 96,799 square foot K-Mart and 4,800 square foot adult
cabaret) plus the 208,180 square feet of proposed shopping center uses.


TRIP ASSIGNMENT
The trip distribution pattern for the proposed project was estimated based on a select zone
assignment obtained from Washington County's travel demand model. The resulting trip distribution
pattern is also shown in Figure 1.


PROPORTIONATE SHARE IMPACT
City staff requested a proportional impact analysis for the project based on the proposed trip
generation and distribution for the site at the May 30, 2012 preliminary project meeting with the City
of Tualatin. To complete this analysis, regionally significant traffic counts used in the on-going
Tualatin Transportation System Plan Update were reused. The resulting proportional impact of the
net new site-generate trips at each regionally significant intersection is illustrated in Figure 3. Based
on these findings, we request that City, County, and ODOT staff review these impacts and confirm the
need to study the remaining list of intersections not previously identified earlier in this
memorandum.

PROPOSED TRIP GENERATION METHODOLOGY
The proposed project is only a partial redevelopment of the larger shopping center. In order to avoid
overestimating the trip generation characteristics of the net new retail uses, the following trip
generation methodology is proposed:

                 Traffic counts were conducted at all of the site driveways to quantify the trip generation
                 profile of the existing retail and civic uses currently operating on the site.

                 Recognizing that the City offices/library are not retail uses and the layout of the
                 site/parking fields prevents a accurate quantification of trips being generated by these
                 uses, estimates were developed using the standard reference manual, Trip Generation.
                 The Library and Single Tenant Office Building land uses were used in the estimate
                 process. The resulting estimates were then subtracted from the existing site driveway
                 counts to produce a trip profile estimate for the existing 158,343 square feet of retail
                 building space at the site.

                 A trip generation rate was calculated using the Shopping Center land use in ITE Trip
                 Generation for the 208,180 square feet of new retail use plus the 56,744 square feet of
                 remaining retail uses (158,343 square feet of existing retail minus 96,799 square foot K-
                 Mart and 4,800 square foot adult cabaret). A separate estimate for the 30,000 square foot
                 of office use was also prepared.

                 The existing site retail traffic estimate was then subtracted from the total shopping center
                 and office trip generation estimate to arrive at a total trip estimate for the net increase in
                 shopping center and office square footage. A pass-by rate reduction of 34% was assumed
                 for the shopping center component to generate the Net New Trip estimate for the site.

Table 2 below illustrates the trip generation calculation process.

                                          INTRODUCTION

Trammell Crow Portland Development II, Inc., represented by Steve Sieber, Vice President,
proposes to redevelop a 17.23-acre concrete pipe plant site operated by Hanson Pipe &
Products Northwest into a speculative multi-tenant industrial park of four Buildings A-D totaling
301,938 square feet (sq ft) with related site improvements. The project is large enough to
necessitate Architectural Review Board (ARB) review and decision pursuant to Tualatin
Development Code (TDC) 73.030(2). The site is bound by railroad right-of-way (ROW) and SW
Herman Road to the north, SW 118th Avenue to the east, SW Myslony Street to the south and
developed industrial private properties to the west.

The applicant had a pre-application meeting on November 22, 2013. The
neighborhood/developer meeting was on January 8, 2014. Staff visited the site on March 12
and 28, 2014. In response to either the notice of application or notice of public hearing, staff
received no letters of comment from property owners within 1,000 ft of the subject property,
including pursuant to Tualatin Development Code (TDC) 31.064(1) within any residential
subdivisions platted through the City, for inclusion in this staff report as of March 28, 2014.

Through a separate and later subdivision application, the applicant will subdivide Lot 1200 into
four Lots A-D as numbered for the industrial park, each with a tax lot number that Washington
County will then assign. Site redevelopment attributes are tabulated below:

    The applicant submitted a traffic impact analysis from Mackenzie dated January 21, 2014.
    This analysis shows that the proposed development does not increase levels of service
    beyond D at the study intersections and recommends no offsite mitigations for this
    development. This is acceptable. The City Engineer generally agrees with the traffic
    impact analysis.

    SW 118th Avenue
    SW 118th Avenue is a City of Tualatin facility and designated as a Minor Collector with a
    right-of-way width of 76 feet, 38 feet from centerline. The cross-section includes:
     52 feet of pavement and gutters which includes:
        o two 12-foot travel lanes
        o two 6-foot bike lanes
        o two 8-foot parking strips
     Two 6–foot planter strips with curb, trees, and streetlights
     Two 6–foot sidewalks

    The plans propose no changes to the existing construction. The existing right-of-way width
    is 70 feet wide with 38 feet from centerline on this developments side. The cross-section of
    is constructed with:
     36 feet of pavement and gutters which includes:
        o two 12-foot travel lanes
        o two 6-foot bike lanes
     Two 6.5–foot wide curb-tight sidewalks
     Two 4-foot planter strips with trees and streetlights on power poles.

    As the amount of right-of-way and improvements include the full required 38-feet from
    centerline and that the curb-tight sidewalk is consistent with the opposite side of the street,
    no modification to the cross-section is needed. This is acceptable.

    The plans show existing power poles to remain. When development occurs, all utilities are
    to be placed underground. There are existing lines and power poles that need to be
    underground. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show all utilities
    underground and the street lights on light poles, for review and approval.

    SW Myslony Street
    SW Myslony Street is a City of Tualatin facility and designated as a Major Collector with a
    right-of-way width of 74 feet, 37 feet from centerline. The cross-section includes:

     The plans show construction and dedication of the half street per the above cross-section,
     with a 7-foot wide planter strip to be able to construct LIDA swale treatment for the street.
     This is acceptable. The applicant will need to submit final plans for SW Myslony Street that
     show a half street cross-section that includes 25 feet of pavement, a 7-foot planter strip
     with curb, trees, and streetlights, and 6-foot sidewalk, for review and approval. The
     applicant will need to dedicate right-of-way sufficient for 38 feet from centerline, for review
     and approval.

     No work shall be undertaken on any public improvement until after the construction plans
     have been approved by the City Engineer and a Public Works Permit and Water Quality
     Permit issued and the required fees paid. The applicant has not obtained a Public Works
     Permit or Water Quality Permit. The applicant will need to obtain a Public Works Permit
     and Water Quality Permit needed for this development.

     All the public improvements required under this chapter shall be completed and accepted
     by the City prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The applicant has not
     completed all public improvements. The applicant will need to complete all the public
     improvements and have them accepted by the City.

3.   Access:
     TDC 73.400 Access
     (2) Owners of two or more uses, structures or parcels of land may agree to utilize
          jointly the same ingress and egress when the combined ingress and egress of
          both uses, structures, or parcels of land satisfies their combined requirements
          as designated in this code; provided that satisfactory legal evidence is
          presented to the City Attorney in the form of deeds, easements, leases or
          contracts to establish joint use.
     (11) Minimum Access Requirements for Commercial, Public and Semi-Public Uses.
          If 1-99 parking spaces are required, only one access is required. If 100-249
          parking spaces are required, two accesses are required. Ingress and egress
          shall not be less than 32 feet wide for the first 50 feet from the right-of-way and
          24 feet thereafter.
AR 14-02, SW Industrial Park
April 11, 2014                                                                        Page 6

    (12) Minimum Access Requirements for Industrial Uses. If 1-250 parking spaces are
         required, only one access is required. Ingress and egress shall not be less than
         36 feet wide for the first 50 feet from the right-of-way and 24 feet thereafter.
    (14) (a) Unless otherwise herein provided, maximum driveway widths shall not
         exceed 40 feet.
    (15) Distance between Driveways and Intersections. Distances listed shall be
         measured from the stop bar at the intersection. (a) At the intersection of
         collector or arterial streets, driveways shall be located a minimum of 150 feet
         from the intersection.

    The plans show four proposed accesses to SW 118 th Avenue and two to SW Myslony
    Street. These accesses either align with or are sufficiently offset from existing accesses on
    the opposite sides of both streets. This is acceptable.

    Note: Accesses are measured at the property line. The plans indicate dimensions at a
    point further onsite, which provides values that are incorrect for this evaluation.

    SW Herman Road is a Minor Arterial, SW 118th Avenue is a Minor Collector, and SW
    Myslony Street is a Major Collector, therefore accesses need to be at least 150 feet from
    intersections of these streets. The southern access to SW 118 th Avenue is approximately
    270 feet north of the intersection with SW Myslony Street and the eastern access to SW
    Myslony Street is approximately 360 feet west of the intersection with SW 118 th Avenue,
    which are acceptable. The northern access to SW 118th Avenue is approximately 145 feet
    away from the intersection with SW Herman Road, which is less than the minimum of 150
    feet. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show the northern access to SW
    118th Avenue at least 150 feet away from the intersection with SW Herman Road, for
    review and approval.

    The four accesses to SW 118th Avenue from north to south are approximately 40, 50, 40,
    and 40 feet wide, respectively. The accesses to SW Myslony Street are both
    approximately 45 feet wide. The minimum access width for commercial use is 32 feet and
    36 feet for industrial, which all of the accesses meet. The maximum width is 40 feet .Three
    accesses exceed this maximum. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show
    all accesses to not exceed the maximum width of 40 feet, for review and approval.

    Tax lot 2S122C001100, to the northwest of this development currently has access north
    across the railroad tracks to SW Herman Road. The railroad desires to eliminate
    dangerous individual accesses crossing railroad tracks, therefore access is needed to SW
    118th Avenue across this development. The developer is proposing a 25-foot wide private
    access easement from SW 118th Avenue to tax lot 2S122C001100. This would support
    two way travel and is acceptable. The applicant will need submit final plans that show a
    25-foot wide private access easement from SW 118th Avenue to tax lot 2S122C001100,
    for review and approval. The applicant will need to submit a copy of the recorded 25-foot
    wide private access easement from SW 118 th Avenue to tax lot 2S122C001100.

Prior to Issuance of a Public Works Permit:
 The applicant shall submit revised plans that show the northern access to SW 118th Avenue
    at least 150 feet away from the intersection with SW Herman Road, for review and approval.
 The applicant shall submit revised plans that show all accesses to not exceed the maximum
    width of 40 feet, for review and approval.
 The applicant shall submit final plans that show a 25-foot wide private access easement
    from SW 118th Avenue to tax lot 2S122C001100, for review and approval.
 The applicant shall submit a copy of the recorded 25-foot wide private access easement
    from SW 118th Avenue to tax lot 2S122C001100.

4.   Water:
     TDC 74.610 (1) Water lines shall be installed to serve each property in accordance
     with the Public Works Construction Code. Water line construction plans shall be
     submitted to the City Engineer for review and approval prior to construction.

     TMC 3-3.040 (2) For nonresidential uses, separate meters shall be provided for each
     structure.

     TMC 3-3.120 (2) The owner of property to which City water is furnished for human
     consumption shall install in accordance with City standards an appropriate
     backflow prevention device on the premises where any of the following
     circumstances exist: (b) Where there is a fire protection service, and irrigation
     service or a nonresidential service connection which is two inches or larger in size;

     TMC 3-3.120 (4) requires all irrigation systems to be installed with a double check
     valve assembly.

     TDC74.610 (3) As set forth in TDC Chapter 12, Water Service, the City has three
     water service levels. All development applicants shall be required to connect the
     proposed development site to the service level in which the development site is
     located.

     The plans show each building with a 2-inch private lateral for domestic water service from
     public water lines in SW 118th Avenue and SW Myslony Street. Additionally, an 8-inch
     private fire line loops from the public line SW 118 th Avenue to SW Myslony Street, circling
     every building onsite. This is acceptable.

     The notes indicate that the domestic water meter boxes include a double check valve.
     Instead a reduced pressure backflow device is needed with a double check valve for
     irrigation. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show a reduced pressure
     backflow device for domestic water service and a double check valve for irrigation, for
     review and approval.

     The plans show extension of an existing 16-inch public water line in SW Myslony Street
     from adjacent to this development. This matches the City’s Water Master Plan and is
     acceptable. At the east end of the connection, within the intersection of SW Myslony Street
     & SW 118th Avenue, no valve is shown. A valve is needed at the end of the new
     connection. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show a valve at the east
     connection of the proposed 16-inch public water line at the within the intersection of SW
     Myslony Street & SW 118th Avenue, for review and approval.

     At the northwest corner of the site, near the railroad tracks, a proposed private fire hydrant
     is shown within an existing sanitary sewer easement. Private structures should be located
     outside of public easements. The applicant will need to submit a revised plan that shows
     the proposed private fire hydrant at the northwest corner of the site, near the railroad
     tracks, outside the existing sanitary sewer easement, for review and approval.

     Note: Any trees within 10 feet of a public water line will need a 24-inch deep, 10-foot long
     root barrier centered on the tree trunk at the edge of the public water easement.

     Note: This site is located in service level ‘A’ and the proposed connection to the public
     system is within this service level. The ‘A’ water service level has unique operating
     characteristics. It needs to be noted that flow tests need to be performed, or calculated,
     under summertime conditions.

     All the public improvements required under this chapter shall be completed and accepted
     by the City prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The applicant has not
     completed all public improvements. The applicant will need to complete all the public
     improvements and have them accepted by the City.

     Note: The water system is designed to allow for a future subdivision.

Prior to issuance of a Public Works Permit:
     The applicant shall submit revised plans that show a reduced pressure backflow device for
      domestic water service and a double check valve for irrigation, for review and approval.
     The applicant shall submit revised plans that show a valve at the east connection of the
      proposed 16-inch public water line at the within the intersection of SW Myslony Street &
      SW 118th Avenue, for review and approval.
     The applicant shall submit a revised plan that shows the proposed private fire hydrant at
      the northwest corner of the site, near the railroad tracks, outside the existing sanitary
      sewer easement, for review and approval.

Prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy:
     The applicant shall complete all the public improvements and have them accepted by the
      City.

5.   Sanitary Sewer:
     TDC 74.620 (1) Sanitary sewer lines shall be installed to serve each property in
     accordance with the Public Works Construction Code. Sanitary sewer construction
     plans and calculations shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review and

    TDC 74.330 Utility Easements (1) Utility easements for water, sanitary sewer and
    storm drainage facilities, telephone, television cable, gas, electric lines and other
    public utilities shall be granted to the City.

    The plans show a sanitary sewer lateral connecting Building A to an existing public
    sanitary sewer line in a public easement on this site adjacent top the north property line.
    Buildings B and C connect to an existing sanitary sewer line in SW 118 th Avenue. Building
    D connects to an existing public sanitary sewer line in a public easement to the west of
    this site adjacent the west property line. This is acceptable. The applicant will need to
    submit final sanitary sewer plans, for review and approval.

    The plans show a private water quality facility within the existing public sanitary sewer
    easement along the north property line. Private water quality facilities should be located
    outside or public easements. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show all
    water quality facilities outside of public sanitary sewer easements, for review and approval.

    The plans show two private catch basins within the existing public sanitary sewer
    easement along the north property line. Private structures should be located outside or
    public easements. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show all private
    structures outside of public sanitary sewer easements, for review and approval.

    The plans show trees within the existing public sanitary sewer easement along the north
    property line. Typically, trees should be located outside or public easements. This
    easement is 25 feet wide and the line is located 10-feet north of the south side of the
    easement. This 10-foot deep line would typically need only a 20-foot wide easement and
    trees within 10-feet of a public line require a root barrier, therefore trees will be allowed
    within the north 5 feet of the easement with associated root barriers. Existing trees are
    allowed to remain. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show all proposed
    trees outside of public sanitary sewer easements with the exception of along the north 5
    feet of the 25-foot public sanitary sewer easement along the north side of the development
    provided root barriers are installed 10-feet from the public line, for review and approval.

    Note: Any trees within 10 feet of a public sanitary sewer line will need a 24-inch deep, 10-
    foot long root barrier centered on the tree trunk at the edge of the public sanitary sewer
    easement.

    All the public improvements required under this chapter shall be completed and accepted
    by the City prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The applicant has not
    completed all public improvements. The applicant will need to complete all the public
    improvements and have them accepted by the City.

    Note: The sanitary sewer system is designed to allow for a future subdivision.

    TMC 3-5-330 Permit Required. Except as provided in TMC 3-5.310, no person shall
    cause any change to improved or unimproved real property that will, or is likely to,
    increase the rate or quantity of run-off or pollution from the site without first
    obtaining a permit from the City and following the conditions of the permit.

    TMC 3-5-380 Criteria for Granting Exemptions to Construction of On-Site Water
    Quality Facilities. A regional public facility may be constructed to serve private non-
    residential development provided:
    (1) The facility serves more than one lot; and
    (2) All owners sign a stormwater facility agreement; and
    (3) Treatment accommodates reasonable worst case impervious area for full build-
        out, stormwater equivalent to existing or proposed roof area is privately treated
        in LIDA facilities, and any detention occurs on each lot.

    The plans show separate stormwater facilities treating and detaining each building and an
    area around each building to accommodate a future subdivision. Beneath each building’s
    loading dock a pipe system provides detention. Due to topography in this basin, gravity
    flow is not possible, therefore pumps are proposed to provide release comparable to the 2
    and 10 year storms, with both pumps active to release less than the 25 year storm. A
    combination of mechanical filters, LIDA swales, and an extended dry pond provides
    treatment. Public lines within public easements are shown to extend to serve adjacent tax
    lot 2S122C001100 and to directly serve future subdivided lots that are part of this
    development. This is acceptable. The applicant will need to submit final plans that show
    stormwater conveyance, treatment, and detention for all impervious surfaces, for review
    and approval. The applicant will need to submit 15-foot wide public stormwater easements
    over the public stormwater lines, for review and approval.

    The plans show a private water quality facility within the proposed public stormwater
    easement along the northeast property line. Private water quality facilities should be
    located outside or public easements. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that
    show all water quality facilities outside of public stormwater easements, for review and
    approval.

    The plans show a private water lines within the proposed public stormwater easement.
    Private water lines should be located outside or public easements and crossings
    minimized. The applicant will need to submit revised plans that show all private water lines
    outside of public stormwater easements with crossings minimized, for review and
    approval.

    The applicant has proposed LIDA street swales within the planter strip on SW Myslony
    Street to treat the right-of-way. This is acceptable. The applicant will need to submit final
    plans that show LIDA street swales in the planter strip on SW Myslony Street, for review
    and approval.

    The applicant has submitted preliminary stormwater calculations that show treatment,
    detention and conveyance of stormwater. Final calculations are needed to match final
    plans. The applicant will need to submit final private and public stormwater calculations for
    treatment, detention, and conveyance, for review and approval.

     Note: Any trees within 10 feet of a public stormwater line will need a 24-inch deep, 10-foot
     long root barrier centered on the tree trunk at the edge of the public sanitary sewer
     easement.

     All the public improvements required under this chapter shall be completed and accepted
     by the City prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The applicant has not
     completed all public improvements. The applicant will need to complete all the public
     improvements and have them accepted by the City.

     Note: The stormwater system is intended to be designed to allow for a future subdivision.
     The plans show Building B without a direct access to a public stormwater easement with
     the proposed property line. Direct access from a property to a public stormwater easement
     is needed. In order to be able to obtain approval for a future subdivision, the proposed
     property line and/or public stormwater line & easement will need to be adjusted to allow
     direct access from the lot to the easement.

Prior to issuance of a Public Works Permit:
     The applicant shall submit final plans that show stormwater conveyance, treatment, and
      detention for all impervious surfaces, for review and approval.
     The applicant shall submit 15-foot wide public stormwater easements over the public
      stormwater lines, for review and approval.

7.   Grading:
     TDC 74.640 (1) Development sites shall be graded to minimize the impact of storm
     water runoff onto adjacent properties and to allow adjacent properties to drain as
     they did before the new development. (2) A development applicant shall submit a
     grading plan showing that all lots in all portions of the development will be served
     by gravity drainage from the building crawl spaces; and that this development will
     not affect the drainage on adjacent properties. The City Engineer may require the
     applicant to remove all excess materials from the development site.

     The submitted plans appear to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff to adjacent
     properties and allow adjacent properties to drain as they did before the development. This
     requirement is met.

               above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access shall be provided with approved fire apparatus access
               roads capable of accommodating fire department aerial apparatus. Overhead utility and power lines shall not be
               located within the aerial fire apparatus access roadway. Fire apparatus access roads shall have a minimum
               unobstructed width of 26 feet in the immediate vicinity of any building or portion of building more than 30 feet in
               height. At least one of the required access routes meeting this condition shall be located within a minimum of 15
               feet and a maximum of 30 feet from the building, and shall be positioned parallel to one entire side of the building.
               (OFC D105)
          4)   TURNING RADIUS: The inside turning radius and outside turning radius shall be not less than 28 feet and
               48 feet respectively, measured from the same center point. (OFC 503.2.4 & 103.3)
          5)   PAINTED CURBS: Fire apparatus access roadway curbs shall be painted red and marked “NO PARKING
               FIRE LANE” at 50 foot intervals. Lettering shall have a stroke of not less than one inch wide by six inches
               high. Lettering shall be white on red background. (OFC 503.3)
          6)   COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS - REQUIRED FIRE FLOW: The required fire flow for the building shall not
               exceed 3,000 gallons per minute (GPM) or the available GPM in the water delivery system at 20 psi,
               whichever is less as calculated using IFC, Appendix B. A worksheet for calculating the required fire flow is
               available from the Fire Marshal’s Office. (OFC B105.3) Please provide a current fire flow test of the
               nearest fire hydrant demonstrating available flow at 20 psi residual pressure as well as fire flow
               calculation worksheets.

7)   FIRE HYDRANT NUMBER AND DISTRIBUTION: The minimum number and distribution of fire hydrants
     available to a building shall not be less than that listed in Appendix C, Table C 105.1.
         Considerations for placing fire hydrants may be as follows:

             Existing hydrants in the area may be used to meet the required number of hydrants as approved.
             Hydrants that are up to 600 feet away from the nearest point of a subject building that is protected
             with fire sprinklers may contribute to the required number of hydrants.
             Hydrants that are separated from the subject building by railroad tracks shall not contribute to the
             required number of hydrants unless approved by the fire code official.
8)   PRIVATE FIRE HYDRANTS: To distinguish private fire hydrants from public fire hydrants, private fire
     hydrants shall be yellow in color. (OFC 507.2.1, NFPA 24 & 291)
9)   PHYSICAL PROTECTION: Where fire hydrants are subject to impact by a motor vehicle, guard posts,
     bollards or other approved means of protection shall be provided. (OFC 507.5.6)
10) CLEAR SPACE AROUND FIRE HYDRANTS: A 3 foot clear space shall be provided around the
     circumference of all private fire hydrants. (OFC 507.5.5)
11) FIRE HYDRANT/FIRE DEPARTMENT CONNECTION: A fire hydrant shall be located within 100 feet of a
     fire department connection (FDC). Fire hydrants and FDCs shall be located on the same side of the fire
     apparatus access roadway and or drive aisle. FDCs shall be remote from the buildings fall zones. Fire
     Department Connections shall be plumbed to the fire sprinkler riser downstream of all control valves. Each
     FDC shall be equipped with a metal sign with 1 inch raised letters and shall read, “WET FIRE SPRINKLER”.
     (OFC 912.2)
12) ACCESS AND FIRE FIGHTING WATER SUPPLY DURING CONSTRUCTION: Approved fire apparatus
     access roadways and fire fighting water supplies shall be installed and operational prior to any combustible
     construction or storage of combustible materials on the site. (OFC 1410.1 & 1412.1)
13) KNOX BOX: A Knox Box for building access is required for these buildings. (OFC 506.1)
14) FIRE DEPARTMENT ACCESS TO EQUIPMENT: Fire protection equipment shall be identified in an
     approved manner. Rooms containing controls for HVAC, fire sprinklers risers, electrical, and/or fire alarm
     equipment shall be identified with approved signs. (OFC 509.1)

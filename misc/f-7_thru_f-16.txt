RE: Lake Grove Goodwill ADC and Shops Traffic Impact Analysis

Dear Todd,

This letter presents the results of the traffic impact analysis for the proposed Lake Grove Goodwill
Attended Donation Center (ADC) and Shops development located in Lake Oswego, Oregon. This study
concludes that the Goodwill ADC and Shops can be developed while maintaining acceptable traffic
operations and safety at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection and the proposed site
driveways along Pilkington Road and Boones Ferry Road. In conjunction with the proposed
development, a shared access along Boones Ferry Road is recommended to minimize impact to
operations and queue lengths at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection. Our analysis
methodology, pertinent findings, and recommendations are documented herein.


INTRODUCTION
Goodwill Industries is proposing to redevelop an existing site at the southwest corner of the Boones
Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection. A vacant industrial-use building that currently occupies the
site which will be demolished and redeveloped. Access to the existing site is provided by three site
driveways (two along Boones Ferry Road and one on Pilkington Road) and a 120-foot section of
perpendicular parking along Pilkington Road. The existing accesses offer no connectivity with adjacent
properties.

The preliminary site plan proposes a Goodwill ADC and a mix of retail and service uses including up to
2,000 square feet for a fast-food restaurant and up to 4,300 square feet of medical-dental office. This
mix of retail was developed to provide a reasonable worst-case (high) trip generation estimate for the
site. Full access to the site is proposed along Pilkington Road and a limited right-in/right-out, left-out
driveway is proposed along Boones Ferry Road. The Boones Ferry Road access will ultimately become a
shared access with the adjacent property to the south (MDC LLC) with redevelopment of that parcel by
others. The proposed development and Phase 1 of the access is anticipated to be built out and
occupied by 2014; Phase 2 of the access will occur when MDC LLC redevelops in the near future. Figure
1 illustrates the site location and vicinity and Figure 2 shows the proposed site plan.

Scope of the Report
This analysis determines the transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed
development and has been prepared in accordance with City of Lake Oswego direction for a traffic
impact analysis. The study intersections and scope of this project were based on consultation with City
staff. Operational analyses were conducted at the following intersection and driveways:

                 Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road
                 Boone Ferry Road/R & M Marine, Inc. Driveway
                 Boones Ferry Road/Les Schwab Tire Center Driveway
                 Boones Ferry Road/Existing South Site Driveway
                 Boones Ferry Road/Lake Grove Veterinary Clinic Driveway
                 Pilkington Road/Anna's Bridal Driveway
                 Pilkington Road/Taylor-Made Labels Driveway

The analysis herein evaluates the following transportation issues:

                 Year 2013 existing transportation-system conditions within the site vicinity during the
                 weekday p.m. peak period;
                 Forecast year 2014 background transportation-system conditions within the site vicinity
                 during the weekday p.m. peak period;
                 Trip generation estimates and distribution for the proposed development;
                 Forecast year 2014 total transportation-system conditions during the weekday p.m. peak
                 period;
                 On-site circulation and queuing analysis; and,
                 Forecast year 2035 total transportation conditions at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington
                 Road intersection during the weekday p.m. peak period.

Following the analysis described above, a driveway sensitivity analysis is provided in which the only
access to the site is provided along Pilkington Road. This sensitivity analysis support the site hardship
variance prepared by Baysinger Partners to justify site access onto Boones Ferry Road. Conclusions and
recommendations are provided at the end of the report.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of roadways within the study area. These conditions serve as a basis for comparison
with future conditions.

August 23, 2013                                                                                                                         Page: 5


The proposed development site and surrounding study area were inventoried in July 2013. At that
time, information was collected regarding site conditions, adjacent land uses, existing traffic
operations, and transportation facilities in the study area.

Manual turning-movement counts were obtained for all the existing study intersections in July 2013.
Per direction from Lake Oswego engineering staff, the identified critical time period is the evening
commuter peak hour. As such, all counts used in this analysis were conducted on a typical mid-week
day during the 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. peak time period. The system-wide evening peak hour occurred
between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. Appendix "A" contains the traffic count worksheets used for this study.


Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The existing site currently has a building that formerly housed commercial and light industrial uses. The
site is zoned as Industrial Park District, and no change to the zoning is proposed. The site is located at
the southwest corner of the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection, east of Interstate 5 (I-5)
and west of Oswego Lake. Land uses surrounding the site are primarily office and commercial uses,
with a boat sales facility to the south along Boones Ferry Road, office uses to the west of Boones Ferry
Road, and a shopping center to the north of Pilkington Road. Access to the site is proposed via two
driveways: one shared access with R & M Marine, Inc. along Boones Ferry Road and one access to the
south of the site along Pilkington Road.


Transportation Facilities
Table 1 summarizes the existing transportation facilities and roadways in the study area. As shown in
Table 1, Boones Ferry Road is a major arterial providing a connection between I-5 and north Lake
Oswego towards Portland. Pilkington Road is a major collector that provides access between the
commercial and office uses along Boones Ferry Road and residential uses to the south.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
As shown in Table 1, Boones Ferry Road provides bicycle lanes along both sides of the street. Sidewalks
are present on both sides of Boones Ferry Road with the exception of the segment between Pilkington
Road and Washington Court where sidewalks are only provided on the east side of the roadway. North
of the site, access across Boones Ferry Road (and across the freight rail lines) is provided with a
sidewalk separated from the roadway with a landscaped median along this segment. No bicycle lanes
are present along Pilkington Road, and a sidewalk is only present along the north side of Pilkington
Road across from the proposed development.


Transit Facilities
TriMet provides local transit service through two routes in the site vicinity, along Boones Ferry Road
and Pilkington Road (Reference 2):

                 Route 37 ­ Lake Grove, provides service between the Lake Oswego Transit Center and the
                 Tualatin Park and Ride. The route has a bus stop at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road
                 intersection, and operates at 1.5 hour headways during the weekdays and does not provide
                 service on weekends.
                 Route 36 ­ South Shore, provides service between the Tualatin Park and Ride, the Lake
                 Oswego Transit Center, and Portland City Center. The route has a bus stop at the Pilkington
                 Road/Jean Road intersection, and operates at 1.5 hour headways during the weekdays and
                 does not provide service on weekends.


Current Levels of Service
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 3). A description of level of service and the
criteria by which they are determined is presented in Appendix "B". Appendix "B" also indicates how
level of service is measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service.

All intersection level-of-service evaluations used the peak 15-minute flow rate during the weekday p.m.
peak hour. Using the peak 15-minute flow rate ensures that this analysis is based on a reasonable
worst-case scenario. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to occur for 15
minutes out of each average peak hour. The transportation system will likely operate under conditions
better than those described in this report during other time periods. The City of Lake Oswego has
defined a level-of-service threshold of "E" for both signalized and unsignalized intersections.

Figure 3, shown previously, summarizes the level-of-service analysis for the study intersections under
the weekday p.m. peak hour existing traffic conditions1. As shown in Figure 3, the study intersection
and driveways operate within Lake Oswego operations thresholds during the weekday p.m. peak hour.
Appendix "C" includes the level-of-service worksheets under year 2013 existing traffic conditions.


Crash Analysis
Crash data was obtained from the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the period of
January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2011 for the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection.
As shown in Table 2, there are seven total reported crashes for the 5-year time period.

            Table 2: Crash History (January 2007 through December 2011)

                                                                               Crash Type               Crash Severity

Of the seven reported crashes, five are rear-end crashes for the southbound left-turning movement
from Boones Ferry Road to Pilkington Road. In addition, there is one crash reported between a
pedestrian and a vehicle traveling on Boones Ferry Road in 2007, and an angle-type crash on Boones
Ferry Road reported in 2009.

The 5 rear-end crashes are evenly distributed within the 5-year crash history (1 in 2007, 2 in 2009, 2 in
2011). Based on field observations, the existing grade differential may have contributed to the crashes.
As discussed later in this report, peak hour queues on this movement could be reduced with additional
effective green time to the southbound left, which could help to alleviate the potential for crashes in
the future. Appendix "D" contains the ODOT crash data.

TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The transportation impact analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will operate
assuming build-out of the proposed development. The impact of traffic generated by the proposed
development during the typical weekday p.m. peak hour was examined as follows:

                 Planned developments and transportation improvements in the site vicinity were
                 identified;
                 Year 2014 (build-out year) background traffic conditions was analyzed at the study
                 intersection and site-access points during the weekday p.m. peak hour;
                 Site-generated trips were estimated for build-out of the site;
                 Site trip-distribution patterns were determined based on a review of the existing
                 transportation network and the nature of the proposed development;
                 Year 2014 total traffic conditions was analyzed at each of the study intersections and site-
                 access points during the weekday p.m. peak hour;
                 Year 2014 total traffic conditions 95th percentile queue analysis at the Boones Ferry
                 Road/Pilkington Road intersection; and,
                 Sight distance and site circulation was reviewed.


Year 2014 Background Traffic Conditions
The background traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area's transportation system will
operate with anticipated growth but without accounting for trips generated from the proposed
development.


Planned Development and Transportation Improvements
The City has planned the installation of revised signal timing at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road
intersection, which will also include a flashing yellow arrow (protected/permitted phasing) for the
Boones Ferry Road approaches. Per direction of Lake Oswego traffic engineering staff, this signal timing
and phasing was implemented throughout the analysis within this report.

There are no planned developments anticipated in the site vicinity prior to full site build-out. However,
trips associated with the currently vacant Otak Incorporated Engineers & Architects (Otak) building
were assumed as in-process trips per direction from City of Lake Oswego staff. Appendix "E" illustrates
the in-process trips associated with the Otak building assuming it will be occupied in 2014.


Regional Background Traffic Growth
This analysis considers the impact of the proposed development's site -generated trips on the roadway
network using future year (2014) traffic volumes. Background traffic growth was developed for both

Boones Ferry Road and Pilkington Road using the Metro-maintained travel demand model. A 1.5
percent annual growth rate was applied based on the link volumes reflected in the travel demand
model, consistent with observed and anticipated growth in surrounding jurisdictions. The 1.5 percent
growth rate was not applied for any movements turning in or out of existing driveways along Boones
Ferry Road and Pilkington Road.

The Metro travel demand model volumes were post-processed using the National Cooperative
Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 255 analysis methodology and existing year 2013 traffic counts to
develop the future year 2035 weekday p.m. peak hour traffic volumes at the Boones Ferry
Road/Pilkington Road intersection.


Level-of-Service Analysis
As shown in Figure 4, the study intersection and driveways are forecast to continue to operate
acceptably under 2014 background traffic conditions. Appendix "F" contains the 2014 background
traffic analysis worksheets.


Proposed Development Plan
Goodwill Industries is proposing to redevelop an existing site at the southwest corner of the Boones
Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection. The existing building will be demolished and the site will be
redeveloped to include a Goodwill Attended Donation Center (ADC) and a retail shopping component.
To provide a high-end estimate of the potential trip generation for the site, the land uses assumed for
the analysis are a 2,000 square-foot fast-food restaurant and up to 4,300 square feet of medical-dental
office. The development is anticipated to be built out and occupied by 2014. The site plan shown in
Figure 2 illustrates the proposed layout with the proposed site driveway locations. A right-in/right-
out/left-out driveway is proposed on Boones Ferry Road and a full access driveway is proposed on
Pilkington Road. Figure 5 illustrates the proposed lane configurations and traffic control devices.


Trip Generation
The trip generation for the proposed site is based on empirical data from the standard reference
manual Trip Generation, 9th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
(Reference 3). Goodwill-specific data was collected to estimate the trip generation associated with the
donation center. Hourly donation data was summarized for weekday trips occurring over a two month
period in 2013 at a similar ADC located in downtown Lake Oswego and can be reasonably expected to
have similar trip generation characteristics as the proposed site. An average weekday p.m. peak hour
trip generation is represented below. Table 3 summarizes the estimated site trip generation of the
proposed development plan during a typical weekday, as well as the typical weekday p.m. peak hour
(daily trips have been rounded to the nearest ten vehicles).

As shown in Table 3, the proposed development plan is estimated to generate up to 111 trips during
the weekday p.m. peak hour. Per direction from Lake Oswego staff and to provide a conservative
analysis, no pass-by trip reduction was applied to the analysis.


Site Trip Distribution/Trip Assignment
The distribution of site-generated trips was determined based on a review of the existing
transportation network, current turning movement patterns, and the nature of the proposed
development. The estimated trip distribution pattern is shown in Figure 6. The estimated site-
generated trips were assigned to the network by distributing the trips shown in Table 3 according to
the trip distribution pattern shown in Figure 6.


Year 2014 Total Traffic Conditions
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area's transportation system will operate
with the traffic generated by the proposed development. As discussed previously, the appropriate
growth rate for local traffic on Boones Ferry Road and Pilkington Road was applied and in-process trips
from the Otak building were added. The forecast site-generated traffic (shown in Figure 6) was added
to the background traffic volumes during the weekday p.m. peak hour (shown in Figure 5) to arrive at
the total traffic volumes that are shown in Figure 7.


Level-of-Service Analysis
As shown in Figure 7, the study intersection and driveways are forecast to continue to operate
acceptably under 2014 total traffic conditions. Appendix "G" contains the 2014 total traffic analysis

95th Percentile Queue Analysis
The traffic operations software Synchro 7 was used to estimate the 95th percentile queues for all
approaches at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection (a 25-foot vehicle length was
assumed in reporting the projected queue lengths). Table 4 shows the estimated 95th percentile
queues relative to the existing storage lengths for each approach, thereby showing the incremental
impact of the development on 95th percentile queue lengths. As documented in Table 4, the estimated
95th percentile queues are forecast to continue to be accommodated by the existing storage lengths
under existing, 2014 background, and 2014 total traffic conditions. Appendix "H" contains the queuing
worksheets.

Planning Year 2035 Total Traffic Conditions
As described previously, the Metro travel demand model volumes were post-processed using the
NCHRP 255 analysis methodology to develop turning movement volumes for the year 2035 weekday
p.m. peak hour at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection. The volumes and forecast total
traffic conditions (includes the proposed development site traffic) intersection operations are shown in
Figure 8.

As shown in Figure 8, the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection is forecast to continue to
operate acceptably under 2035 total traffic conditions. Appendix "I" contains the Metro travel demand
model raw volumes and the 2035 total traffic analysis worksheets.


Site Access, Circulation, and Preliminary Sight Distance Verification
This section addresses the proposed changes to the site access points and preliminary sight distance
verification.


Site Access
As described in the proposed development plan, the existing site's three driveways and open frontage
along Pilkington Road will be reduced to two total driveways, with the access to Boones Ferry Road
operating as a shared access with the property to the south.

Along Boones Ferry Road, the two existing full movement site driveways (located at 113 feet and 244
feet from the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection) will be consolidated and relocated to a
single driveway located approximately 284 feet south of Pilkington Road along Boones Ferry Road. The
proposed driveway will ultimately provide shared access with the property to the south, and is
proposed to be 26 feet wide to accommodate truck circulation into the site. This width, as shown in
Appendix "J," is the minimum width that is expected to accommodate the movement of delivery
vehicles on-site. In addition, the 26-foot wide driveway is expected to provide efficient simultaneous
ingress and egress into the site.

Along Pilkington Road, the existing open frontage (no curb) along Pilkington Road between Boones
Ferry Road and the proposed site driveway will be improved with curb/gutter/sidewalk, thus
eliminating approximately 125 feet of conflicting parking movements with through traffic. In addition,
the existing site driveway along Pilkington Road will be relocated from its existing location
(approximately 220 feet from Boones Ferry Road) to a distance approximately 260 feet from the
Boones Ferry Road intersection.

Circulation
Along Boones Ferry Road, the proposed access will allow patron vehicles to enter the site as a right-in
movement and exit the site as a right-out or a left-out movement. All traffic that would be turning left
into the site is assumed to access the site via the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road signalized
intersection. As described in further detail in the sensitivity analysis provided in the following section,
the left-out movement provides relief to the left-turn approach to the signal on Pilkington Road. Truck
circulation (WB-40 design vehicle) through the site will occur entering from Boones Ferry Road and
exiting onto Pilkington Road (as shown in Appendix "J").

On site queuing is not expected to exceed 100 feet during the weekday p.m. peak hour, and driveway
throat lengths have been designed to provide adequate queue storage.


Preliminary Sight Distance Verification
A preliminary sight distance verification was conducted at the site access locations along Boones Ferry
Road and Pilkington Road to assess whether sufficient stopping sight distance (SSD) and intersection
sight distance (ISD) can be provided. Per the recommendations in the AASHTO reference manual 2 for a
35 mile-per-hour roadway, the recommended stopping and intersection sight distances are 250 feet
and 390 feet, respectively. A driver's eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height of 2. 0 feet was
assumed, and all measurements were taken 14.5 feet from the edge of the travel way.

Based on preliminary investigation, adequate stopping sight distance and intersection sight distance
are expected to be provided at both proposed access locations. Additional details are provided below.

Boones Ferry Road Access
To the north, sight distance in excess of 400 feet is expected to be available upon buildout from the
proposed driveway location. To the south, intersection sight distance was measured to be
approximately 440 feet and stopping sight distance at 280 feet.

Pilkington Road Access

Facing north, there is approximately 260 feet of roadway between the proposed driveway and the
Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection. Clear sightlines are expected to be available to the
location of the stop bar at the signal. Although this distance (260 feet) is less than the recommended
ISD (390 feet for 35 miles per hour) due to roadway geometric constraints, the speeds at which vehicles
are approaching is expected to be less than 35 miles per hour. The recommended SSD distance (250

feet) is exceeded and the driveway is located a distance further from the signalized intersection than
under existing conditions.

To the south, various ground foliage, tree branches, and a utility pole present some sight line
obstruction. Upon redevelopment, it is recommended that the existing foliage within the public right-
of-way be cleared and/or maintained to maximize the available sight distance available. With these
mitigations, adequate intersection and stopping sight distance is expected to be available.

It is further recommended that any landscaping, above ground utilities or signage associated with the
proposed development be located and maintained to ensure that adequate sight distance is continued
to be provided.

DRIVEWAY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
In recognition that the current City code (Section 50.06.003.1.c.iii) specifies that access to an arterial
roadway is not permitted, a hardship variance is being submitted in conjunction with this traffic study
to justify the proposed access onto Boones Ferry Road. In support of the hardship variance, this traffic
study analyzes a scenario in which all traffic enters and exits the site from Pilkington Road. This
limitation in access points, as shown in the analysis provided herein, does not provide a benefit to the
overall transportation system. Details of the analysis are provided in the following sections, followed by
a summary table of the transportation-related pros/cons associated with the proposed Boones Ferry
Road access.


Year 2014 Traffic Volumes and Operations
A 2014 traffic sensitivity analysis was prepared for the site driveway along Pilkington Road and for the
Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road signalized intersection, assuming no vehicle trips access the site via
Boones Ferry Road. Traffic volumes as shown in Figure 6 were re-assigned and added to the
background traffic volumes shown in Figure 4 to arrive at the traffic volumes shown in Figure 9. All
findings below represent 2014 total traffic conditions.

As shown in Figure 9, the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection is forecast to increase in
overall volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio from 0.64 to 0.66 with the re-routed traffic volumes. In
particular, the westbound left-turn (from Pilkington Road to southbound Boones Ferry Road) v/c ratio
increases from 0.57 to 0.64, and the 95th percentile queuing is estimated to increase from 150 to 175
feet. A secondary operational impact of Boones Ferry Road access closure is the increase in delays in
the northbound direction for vehicles entering the site. The northbound right-turn v/c ratio increases
from 0.62 to 0.63, and the 95th percentile queuing is estimated to increase from 375 to 400 feet. One
additional metric not captured in the analysis is the additional time and out-of-direction travel required
for northbound vehicles to enter the site. Northbound vehicles will be required to travel an additional
545 feet (distance of driveways from signalized intersection = 285 feet + 260 feet) to access the site,
which translates into additional delay for through vehicles and less desirability to the site as a trip
attractor. Additional details regarding the potential economic hardships (lease-ability, tenant exposure,
etc.) are provided in the supplemental Hardship Variance application prepared by Baysinger Partners.

Appendix "K" includes operations and queuing worksheets without the inclusion of the Boones Ferry
Road site access.

                           All exiting traffic will join the   Existing congestion along Pilkington Road (i.e. interaction between queues and
                           Pilkington Road approach to the     driveways to the north of the proposed site) between the proposed site driveway
                           signalized intersection             and the signalized intersection will increase due to the additional vehicle trips.

                           access.                             gaps along Pilkington Road).

                           Vehicles                            Increased on-site congestion and circulation challenges with only one access point.
                                                               The existing site could be leased to industrial tenants (fewer trips than the
  Economic                 Existing site usage with existing   proposed development), which would use the existing three driveways. (Note that
  Development              accesses (no redevelopment)         the proposed development would be operating with more site-generated traffic and
                                                               fewer accesses than the existing allowed uses, further constraining the site).




As summarized in Table 5 above, it is clear that a dual access approach to redevelopment benefits the
site as well as the transportation system. The proposed access plan is an improvement over the existing
access condition, consolidating two full movement driveways on Boones Ferry Road into one shared
right-in/right-out/left-out with future connectivity to the south property. The proposed dual accesses
minimize the need for out-of-direction travel and facilitate emergency vehicle access and circulation.

While the City's desire to close access onto Boones Ferry Road is consistent with City Code in the near
term, the proposed shared access configuration onto Boones Ferry Road is consistent with the City
Code goals in the long term, providing the opportunity to further consolidate driveways along Boones
Ferry Road with the development of the property to the south.


Additional Transportation Related Impacts
In addition to the added delay for vehicles accessing the site and through vehicles on Boones Ferry
Road, Table 5 summarizes impacts anticipated related to limiting site access to only Pilkington Road.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Year 2013 Existing Conditions
                 All study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service during the weekday p.m. peak
                 hour.
                 Observed traffic patterns indicate that the weekday p.m. peak hour experiences
                 southbound left-turn queuing that exceeds the existing storage provided along Boones
                 Ferry Road at the intersection with Pilkington Road. This queue storage deficiency is
                 addressed with the proposed signal timing changes planned by City of Lake Oswego staff.
                 Note: the proposed signal timing for the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection are
                 used throughout the report, per direction from Lake Oswego traffic engineering staff.
                 A review of historical crash data did not reveal any patterns or trends in the site vicinity
                 that require mitigation associated with the impacts of project.
                 The existing study site is served by an open right-of-way curb cut along Pilkington Road and
                 three site driveways (two on Boones Ferry Road and one on Pilkington Road). The existing
                 accesses offer no connectivity with adjacent properties.
                 The existing building on-site could be reoccupied as an industrial land use with the existing
                 driveway configuration.

Year 2014 Background Conditions
                 All study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of service
                 during the weekday p.m. peak hour assuming continued local and regional traffic volume
                 growth.

Proposed Development Plan
                 The site will be redeveloped to include a Goodwill Attended Donation Center (ADC) and a
                 retail shopping component. To provide a high estimate of the potential trip generation, the
                 land uses assumed for the analysis are a 2,000 square-foot fast-food restaurant and up to
                 4,300 square feet of medical-dental office.
                 The existing site driveways will be reconfigured in conjunction with redevelopment.
                               The two site driveways on Boones Ferry Road will be consolidated to one that is
                               located at the west property line. This driveway will be eventually shared with the
                               property to the south when that parcel redevelops in the near future (Phase 2 of
                               access), allowing for additional future access consolidation along the Boones Ferry
                               Road corridor.
                               The existing open curb cut along Pilkington Road will be improved with curb, gutter,
                               and sidewalk, removing access to the site directly from the roadway right-of-way.

August 23, 2013                                                                                                   Page: 25


                               The existing site driveway on Pilkington Road will be relocated further to the south,
                               increasing distance between the site driveway and Boones Ferry Road.
                 The total proposed development is estimated to generate up to approximately 111 net new
                 weekday p.m. peak hour trips (53 in, 58 out).

Year 2014 Total Traffic Conditions
                 All study intersections are forecast to continue to operate at acceptable levels of service
                 per Lake Oswego operations thresholds during the weekday p.m. peak hour upon full site
                 redevelopment.

On-Site Circulation/Site Access
                 The existing site's three driveways will be reduced to two driveways, with the access to
                 Boones Ferry Road ultimately operating as a shared access with the redevelopment of the
                 property to the south.
                               The two existing full movement site driveways along Boones Ferry Road (located at
                               113 feet and 244 feet from the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection) will
                               be consolidated and relocated to a single driveway located approximately 284 feet
                               south of Pilkington Road along Boones Ferry Road.

                               The existing open frontage (no curb) along Pilkington Road between Boones Ferry
                               Road and the proposed site driveway will be improved with curb/gutter/sidewalk.

                 The existing site driveway along Pilkington Road will be relocated from its existing location
                 (approximately 220 feet from Boones Ferry Road) to a distance approximately 260 feet
                 from the Boones Ferry Road intersection.
                 Truck circulation (WB-62 design vehicle) through the site will occur entering from Boones
                 Ferry Road and exiting onto Pilkington Road.
                 On site queuing is not expected to exceed 100 feet during the weekday p.m. peak hour, and
                 driveway throat lengths have been designed to provide adequate queue storage.
                 Sufficient sight distance is expected to continue to be available at the site-access driveways
                 upon buildout.

Planning Year 2035 Total Traffic Conditions
                 The Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection is forecast to continue to operate
                 within operations thresholds under 2035 total traffic conditions during the weekday p.m.
                 peak hour.

Hardship Variance Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis was prepared to address the implications of providing a single driveway on
Pilkington Road to serve the site. This scenario assumes no vehicle trips access the site via Boones Ferry
Road. All findings below represent 2014 Total Traffic Conditions.

                 The Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection is forecast to increase in overall
                 volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio from 0.64 to 0.66 with the re-routed traffic volumes.
                               The westbound left-turn v/c ratio increases from 0.57 to 0.64, and the 95th
                               percentile queuing is estimated to increase from 150 to 175 feet.

                               The northbound right-turn v/c ratio increases from 0.62 to 0.63, and the 95th
                               percentile queuing is estimated to increase from 375 to 400 feet.

                 Circulation impacts
                               All vehicles (53 in, 58 out) would be required to navigate the site into and out of the
                               Pilkington Road access.
                               Existing congestion along Pilkington Road (i.e. interaction between queues and
                               driveways to the north of the proposed site) between the proposed site driveway
                               and the signalized intersection will increase due to the additional vehicle trips.
                               On-site queuing is expected to increase with all 58 vehicles exiting onto Pilkington
                               Road.

                               Potential increased aggressive driving behavior (accepting shorter gaps along
                               Pilkington Road) with all 58 outbound vehicles exiting from a single access.

                               Fire/Emergency Vehicle access will be reduced to one entry/exit point.

                               Approximately half of site-generated trips would be required to navigate to the site
                               via out-of-direction travel.

                               The resulting out-of-direction travel results in additional turn movement interaction
                               with pedestrians at the Boones Ferry Road/Pilkington Road intersection.

                               The existing site could be leased to industrial tenants (fewer trips than the proposed
                               development), which would use the existing three driveways. The proposed
                               development would be operating with more site-generated traffic and fewer
                               accesses than the existing allowed uses, further constraining the site.

                               Truck circulation would be required to enter and exit from Pilkington Road,
                               contributing to existing congestion, and requiring additional impervious paved area
                               on-site to accommodate truck circulation. Increased on-site truck maneuvering may
                               result in more interactions between other trucks, vehicles, and pedestrians.

Description of Level of Service
         Methods and Criteria
LEVEL OF SERVICE CONCEPT
Level of service (level of service) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort
(including such elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and
impediments caused by other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or
roadway segment. Six grades are used to denote the various Level of Service from A to F.3


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
The six level of service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table B1.
Additionally, Table B2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay
per vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time,
stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service D is generally
considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

                                                            Table B1
                                      Level of Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)
          Level of
          Service                                                                     Average Delay per Vehicle
                             Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and
               A             most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low
                             delay.
                             Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally
               B             occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher
                             levels of average delay.
                             Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher
                             delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
               C
                             The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without
                             stopping.
                             Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence
                             of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long
               D
                             cycle length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines.
                             Individual cycle failures are noticeable.
                             Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually
               E             considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression,
                             long cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                             Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This
               F             condition often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual
                             cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled
(AWSC) intersections. The 1997 Highway Capacity Manual provides new models for estimating
control delay at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various
service levels associated with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B3. A quantitative
definition of level of service for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B4. Using this
definition, Level of Service E is generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design
standard.

                          Nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
        A
                          Very seldom is there more than one vehicle in queue.
                          Some drivers begin to consider the delay an inconvenience.
        B
                          Occasionally there is more than one vehicle in queue.
                          Many times there is more than one vehicle in queue.
        C
                          Most drivers feel restricted, but not objectionably so.
                          Often there is more than one vehicle in queue.
        D
                          Drivers feel quite restricted.
                          Represents a condition in which the demand is near or equal to the probable maximum number of vehicles that can
                          be accommodated by the movement.
        E
                          There is almost always more than one vehicle in queue.
                          Drivers find the delays approaching intolerable levels.
                          Forced flow.
        F                 Represents an intersection failure condition that is caused by geometric and/or operational constraints external to
                          the intersection.

It should be noted that the level of service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is
that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities.
The expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less onerous than at unsignalized intersections.
For example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while
drivers on the minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of
identifying acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the
amount of delay experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized
intersections. For these reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level
of service is less for an unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall
intersection level of service is calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only
calculated for the minor approaches and the major street left turn movements at TWSC
intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street through movements. For TWSC
intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains undefined: level-of-service is only
calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOE's) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average
queue lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst
movement only, such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic
control decisions. The potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly
pronounced when the HCM level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case
in many public agencies.

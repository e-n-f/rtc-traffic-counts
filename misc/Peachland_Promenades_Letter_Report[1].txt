RE:     Revised Transportation Analysis ­ Proposed Driveway Modifications
        Peachland Promenades
        Proposed 147,779 s.f. Retail Center
        Southeast Quadrant of Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard
        Charlotte County, Florida
        CPH Project Number: B6753.1

Dear Mr. Vattikuti:

This revised analysis is provided in support of the proposed project "Peachland Promenades" located in
the southeast quadrant of Peachland Boulevard and Loveland Boulevard in Charlotte County, Florida.
Please see Appendix A for site location map and Appendix B for site plan. The original traffic study dated
August 2007 considered two full access driveways Loveland Boulevard. This letter details the revisions to
traffic analysis and provides justification for a full access driveway on Loveland Boulevard. The build-out
year for the proposed project is the year 2010.

Site Access
Access to the site is proposed via two new driveways, a right-in/right-out driveway (D-1) on Peachland
Boulevard, a full access driveway (D-2) on Loveland Boulevard. In addition, cross-access is proposed to
the other existing driveways east of the proposed site called as "Charlotte Commons". The driveways
considered for cross-access are full access (D-3) on Peachland Boulevard and a full access (D-4) on
Veterans Boulevard. Please see Appendix B, site plan for driveway locations.

It is anticipated that Driveway D-2 on Loveland Boulevard will be required for safe truck ingress to the
site. Per the figure provided in Appendix H, trucks (of size WB-50) are anticipated to arrive at the project
site from the East on Peachland Boulevard. If Driveway D-2 on Loveland Boulevard is not constructed as
reflected on the plans, trucks will be required to perform a u-turn westbound on Peachland Boulevard at
the intersection of Loveland Boulevard. Based upon the Truck Turning Template in Appendix H, it
appears there may not be adequate room at the intersection to accommodate u-turns from WB-50 size
trucks, and operational and safety considerations may result.

Trip Generation
The trip generation potential for the proposed project was determined based upon Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE), 8th Edition. ITE land use code 820, shopping center was used to project
trip generation for the proposed project site. Per coordination with the County staff, an internal capture
rate of 10% was used as cross-access exists to the adjacent retail development. Pass-by rates were
applied based upon ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition. Pass-by rates were checked and
adjusted to be less than 10% of the adjacent street pm peak hour traffic. Please see Appendix C for trip
generation calculations worksheets for reference. Table 1, ITE Trip Generation shows a summary of trip
generation projections.

Based upon the trip generation projections, it was determined that the proposed project is anticipated to
generate 8,754 gross daily trips and 627 net-new pm peak hour trips.

Study Area and Traffic Data
Based upon coordination with County staff, the study area consists of the following intersections:

            x Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard;
            x Peachland Boulevard & Western most Driveway (D-1), and
            x Loveland Boulevard & Driveway (D-2).

Traffic data was collected at the intersections of Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard and
Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard on May 5, 2010. Appropriate peak season correction factors
were applied to the raw turning movement counts at these intersections. Please see Appendix C for traffic
data. In addition, traffic volume data and projections were shown at the following intersections:

            x Peachland Boulevard & Existing Full Access Driveway (D-3);
            x Peachland Boulevard & Veterans Boulevard, and
            x Veterans Boulevard & Existing (Charlotte Commons) Driveway (D-4).

Please see Appendix D for traffic volume figures.

Trip Distribution
Since this analysis assumes one full access driveway on Loveland Boulevard, a modification to the trip
distribution analyzed in August 2007 (previous) traffic impact statement was required. This was due to the
fact that the change in the access to the proposed site changes the project trip distribution. In this
analysis the total project trips generated by the proposed project are re-distributed between the two (2)
full-access driveways. The modified distribution of net-new and project traffic are shown in the attached
figures. The future total traffic volumes are also shown in the attached figures in Appendix D.

Modified Future Total Traffic Analysis
Intersection analysis was conducted for the above mentioned three (3) intersections: Peachland
Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard and at two (2) new project driveways using Highway Capacity Software
(HCS+) version 5.2. Please see Table 2, for intersection analysis results.

Based upon the analysis conducted for the above intersections, it was determined that the intersection of
Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard operates at LOS F and the driveways on Peachland
Boulevard and Loveland Boulevard are anticipated to operate at LOS B and LOS C respectively.

For the intersection of Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard the stop controlled approaches are
operating at LOS F, indicating that the side street LOS and delay are predicted regardless of the volume
of minor-street left turning traffic. Generally longer minor street delays are considered tolerable, such as in
this instance where there is a need for progression along major streets. Such as at the intersection of
Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard in the future total traffic, the HCS+ analysis reports delay of
1081 sec/veh for northbound and 524.7 sec/veh for southbound approaches (stop controlled
approaches), due to the lack of suitable gaps which indicates major street progression. The LOS results
in this analysis are not necessarily an indication that this intersection requires signal warrant study; given
that the volumes are low enough that a signal would not likely be warranted. In evaluating this
intersection, additional measures of effectiveness and safety considerations may also be considered if
further review is considered. Please see pages 17-26 and 17-27 of HCM in Appendix H for reference.

Turn Lane Warrant Analysis
Turn lane warrant analysis was conducted per the National Cooperative Highway Research Program
(NCHRP) Report 457 "Evaluating Intersection Improvements": An Engineering Study Guide". Please see
the attached warrant analysis worksheets from NCHRP 457 in Appendix G for reference. The analysis
Indicates:

            x For the intersection of Peachland Boulevard & D-1, an eastbound right-turn lane is not
              warranted.
            x For the intersection of Loveland Boulevard & D-2, southbound left-turn lane is warranted, and
              northbound right-turn lane is not warranted.
            x For the intersection of Peachland & Loveland Boulevard, for northbound approach a two-lane
              approach is warranted.

Discussion of Full Access Driveway on Loveland Boulevard
As noted previously, Driveway D-2 on Loveland Boulevard will be the only access that will effectively
provide truck access to the site given that trucks are anticipated to arrive at the site from I-75 and
Veterans Boulevard to the east. Without this access, trucks will have to make a u-turn in the westbound
direction at the intersection of Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard to access the site which could
create safety and operational issues. Please see the attached Auto-Turn truck route templates with and
without driveway access on Loveland Boulevard in Appendix H for reference.

In addition to truck access, project traffic coming form south on Loveland Boulevard can access the site
through a proposed driveway on Loveland Boulevard. Without this access on Loveland Boulevard, trips to
and from the south will be required to travel through the intersection of Peachland Boulevard and
Loveland Boulevard to enter the site, which will increase traffic volumes through the intersection and
interfere with existing traffic operations.

Accordingly, the applicant requests support from staff to secure a waiver from the Board of County
Commissioners (BOCC) to allow a full-access driveway connection (Driveway D-2) from Loveland
Boulevard to the proposed commercial site.

Conclusions
CPH Engineers, Inc. has conducted a traffic impact analysis for a 147,779 s.f. shopping center located in
the southeast quadrant of the intersection of Peachland Boulevard & Loveland Boulevard in Charlotte
County, Florida.

Capacity analysis conducted for the study area intersections indicate that unsignalized intersections the
stop controlled approaches are operating at LOS F. Generally, longer minor street delays are considered
tolerable, such as in this instance, given the need for progression on the major street.

Based upon a review of the location of the proposed site access points the proposed project driveways
are anticipated to provide adequate access to the site given the projected trip generation potential of the
proposed land use. The data, analysis and findings of this report are pursuant to the requirements by
Charlotte County and subsequent coordination with the County staff.

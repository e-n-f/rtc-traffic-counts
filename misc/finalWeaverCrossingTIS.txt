                                                    Town of Chapel Hill: Traffic Impact Study
                                         Weaver Crossing – Proposed Commercial Development


I. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Project Overview

A new commercial development named Weaver Crossing, to be located along N.C. 86 (Martin
Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) at Weaver Dairy Road, is being proposed in Chapel Hill. The project
will primarily develop vacant land with a small redevelopment of an existing business and
several mobile homes along Sparrow Lane.            Figure 1 (found in Appendix A) shows the
general location of the site. The project is anticipated to be fully complete by 2016. This report
analyzes the full build-out scenario for the year 2017 (one year after anticipated completion), the
no-build scenario for 2017, as well as 2014 existing year traffic conditions.

The proposed site concept plan shows restricted right-turn in/right-turn out only (RIRO)
driveways along NC 86 and Weaver Dairy Road, with a one-way southbound exit driveway and
one full movement service access driveway along Sparrow Lane. No other vehicular access
connections are proposed. Figure 2 displays the preliminary concept plan of Weaver Crossing
and nearby land uses and roadways. The current plan includes several commercial buildings to
be developed into a pharmacy, retail shops, a bank, and office space. 136 on-site surface
parking spaces will also be provided.

B. Site Location and Study Area

This report analyzes and presents the transportation impacts that Weaver Crossing will have on
the following intersections in the project study area:

   •   NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Weaver Dairy Road
   •   NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Sparrow Lane
   •   NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Westminster Drive
   •   Weaver Dairy Road and Banks Drive
   •   NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Site Access Driveway #1 (RIRO)
   •   Weaver Dairy Road and Site Access Driveway #2 (RIRO)
   •   Sparrow Lane and Site Access Driveway #3 (Southbound One-Way Exit Only)
   •   Sparrow Lane and Full Access Service Driveway #4

The impacts of the proposed site at the study area intersections will be evaluated during the
AM, noon, and PM peak hours of an average weekday. The following study is based on
background traffic for the existing year, 2014, and the year following the estimated site build out
year of 2014, as well as the estimated net site-generated traffic produced by the commercial
development.

There are numerous Town-approved future developments in, or just beyond, the immediate
project study area that were considered to be constructed by 2017 and may generate additional
background traffic. An area-wide ambient future traffic growth percentage of 1.0 percent per
year was applied to the existing volumes, based on historical average annual daily traffic
(AADT) growth rate data provided by the Town of Chapel Hill and NCDOT, and consistent with
recent study area traffic impact studies.

                                         Weaver Crossing – Proposed Commercial Development


C. Site Description

The Weaver Crossing site features land parcels that
are primarily vacant open or wooded land. The
southern portion of the site will impact an existing
small business and several mobile homes in The
Village mobile home park. The site is surrounded by
commercial development to the east and the mobile
home park to the south. Additional residential
subdivisions are present to the south and west of
the site, with some significant commercial and retail
development along Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard and Weaver Dairy Road (Timberlyne
Shopping Center) to the east.                                 Existing Weaver Crossing Site

The proposed site will have frontage along both Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Weaver
Dairy Road and will have single RIRO driveways connecting to these arterial roadway facilities.
Additional access driveways are proposed along Sparrow Lane – one driveway will be a one-
way southbound exit only and the other driveway is designated as a full access facility. The
proposed site plan, shown in Figure 2, indicates all parking will be accommodated on-site, with
surface parking facilities. Due to the physical limitations of the site, proposed access points and
location of proposed parking facilities and building footprints, some internal site vehicle
circulation will be limited to one-way movements. Sidewalk connections and bicycle racks are
also shown on the site plan.

D. Existing and Proposed Uses in Vicinity of Site

The land uses and development in the study area are primarily residential, with some higher
density commercial areas located along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Weaver Dairy
Road. The Existing Land Use Plan shown in the 2020 Town of Chapel Hill Comprehensive Plan
and adopted June 25, 2012, indicates that the proposed site is designated as a combination of
“undeveloped land” and “medium density residential – 4-8 units/acre”. The Future Land Use
Plan, that is also a part of the Town Comprehensive Plan, indicates that the parcel would be
included in a “Town/Village Center” that also includes the Timberlyne Shopping Center and
areas north of Weaver Dairy Road east of NC 86. The recently updated Comprehensive Plan
also indicates that this parcel is a “Development Opportunity Area” and a “Future Focus
Discussion Area”. The parcel is currently zoned “Mixed-Use – Office/Institutional 1”.

E. Existing and Committed Surface Transportation Network

Roadways
The Weaver Crossing project study area features several major arterial roadways serving areas
throughout the Town of Chapel Hill and points beyond, as well as a number of collector and
local access streets. Table 1, on the following page, summarizes pertinent information on the
study area roadway facilities.

AADT data was taken from 2011 AADT mapping produced by the NCDOT Traffic Survey Unit
and compared to fall 2009 data collected for the Transportation Impact Analysis – Carolina
North (December 2009 Update) by Vanesse, Hughes, and Brustlin (VHB). Figure 3 shows the
existing lane configuration, traffic control, and speed limits for these study area roadways.
Detailed descriptions of several of the major study area roadways are as follows:

    •   N.C. Highway 86 (Martin Luther King Jr, Blvd) is a principal arterial in the study area,
        serving areas from I-40 (via Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) to downtown Chapel Hill
        and the US 15-501 corridor to the south. In the study area vicinity, Martin Luther King,
        Jr. Boulevard is a four to six-lane divided cross-section. There are multiple driveway
        access points along the roadway and several major street intersections. No on-street
        parking is permitted along N.C. 86 in the project study area. Several bus stops are
        located along the facility. The posted speed limit is 35 mph in the study area.

    •   Weaver Dairy Road is a minor arterial that connects areas of east and north Chapel Hill.
        In the study area, Weaver Dairy Road has been widened to a four-lane divided median
        facility with a 35 mph speed limit. The upgrades also include access restrictions for
        private and commercial driveways, sidewalks and bicycle lanes. No on-street parking is
        permitted.

    •   Westminster Drive and Weaver Dairy Road Extension are collector streets that
        provide access to residential neighborhoods along NC 86. Both are two-lane facilities,
        with Weaver Dairy Road Extension having a raised center median. The posted speed
        limit is 25 mph on both facilities. Both feature sidewalk and bicycle lanes. On-street
        parking is not permitted.

    •   Banks Drive is a local access street for traffic accessing the Timberlyne Shopping
        Center. It features sidewalk and a three-lane undivided cross-section with a continuous
        center left-turn lane and a 25 mph speed limit. On-street parking is not permitted.

    •   Sparrow Lane is a local access street for a small residential mobile home development.
        It is a two-lane unpaved road.

The project study area features a mixture of signalized and unsignalized intersections. The
N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) corridor features coordinated signal operation for
weekday peak hours.

Bicycle Routes and Sidewalks
Specific bicycle facilities are present in the immediate study area, with striped bicycle lanes in
both directions along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. Bicycle lanes are also present on
Weaver Dairy Road Extension and Westminster Drive. Pedestrian sidewalk is found along both
sides of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard through the study area. Additional connectivity exists
between these sections and side streets along the corridor. Crosswalks and pedestrian signals
are present across Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at the Weaver Dairy Road intersection.
Figure 4 displays a schematic of existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the project study
area.

Transit Routes
Current Chapel Hill Transit (CHT) Routes NS and T serve the project study area along Martin
Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, Weaver Dairy Road and Westminster Drive with weekday bus
service (T Route also provides Saturday service). Numerous bus stops, with a range of
amenities (shelters, benches), are present in and near the study area. Table 3 details the two
current CHT routes serving the study area. Most buses run on 15, 30, or hour headways during
weekday peak service periods.

Triangle Transit provides regional bus service to the immediate study area via the 420 Route
that runs along NC 86 between Chapel Hill and Hillsborough. Service for this route occurs at 30
minute headways during peak weekday periods. Triangle Transit also provides express bus
service from Chapel Hill to Raleigh on the CRX Route that uses NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard) in the study area on 30 minute headways during weekday peak hours

Figure 5 displays transit routes and bus stops that currently exist in the project study area.
Transit trips were estimated for the Weaver Crossing site in the following sections of this report,
since the proximity and frequency of transit service along NC 86 adjacent to the site could
account for a measurable portion of site-related trips.

Recommended/Committed Surface Transportation Improvement Projects
There are no committed/programmed NCDOT State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP) projects in the study area that are expected to be complete by 2017. NCDOT has
completed the Weaver Dairy Road corridor improvements (STIP U-3306). There are two
approved/committed improvement private development projects expected to be complete by the
2017 analysis year in the project study area (Charterwood and Children’s Campus of Chapel
Hill). Their impacts and proposed improvements were considered to be complete.

There are numerous additional recommended improvements to transportation facilities in
Weaver Crossing project study area that may occur as the Carolina North development
progresses to the south of the project study area. However any additional improvements due to
Carolina North were considered post-2017 analysis year for the purposes of this study.

F. Existing Traffic Conditions

Figure 6 shows recent weekday AM, noon, and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the study area
intersections. The counts used to determine these volumes were updated in October 2014 for
all existing study area intersections during the weekday periods 7:00 - 9:00 AM, 11:30 AM –
1:30 PM, and 4:00 – 6:00 PM. The draft version of this traffic impact study used older count
data from 2013 as a baseline. The counts were updated after the submittal of the draft report to
reflect the latest traffic conditions in the project study area. A comparison of 2013 and 2014
count data shows relatively little change in the magnitude or directionality of traffic flows in the
project study area. The updated turning movement count output is found in Appendix B.

Traffic count information shows that traffic flows on N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard)
were heavy during the AM and PM peak count periods, with southbound flows into downtown
Chapel Hill heaviest in the AM peak and northbound return flows heaviest in the PM peak.
Traffic on Weaver Dairy Road was moderate to heavy during the peak commuting periods.
Traffic flows were light to moderate on the remaining study area roadways that function as
collector or local access streets.

II. 2017 BUILD-OUT YEAR +1 CONDITIONS

A. Future Ambient Area-Wide Traffic Growth Estimation

Based on information on average daily traffic collected by the Town of Chapel Hill and the
NCDOT, a yearly ambient traffic growth rate of 1.0 percent per year was used for the short-term
2017 design year capacity analyses. This rate is based on previous and anticipated growth
trends for this area from Town and NCDOT average daily traffic information from the period
1990-2013. Figure 7 shows ambient area-wide growth traffic volume projections.

It is important to also note that multiple significant background traffic generating developments
were included in this study, and would likely contribute a significant portion of new trips in the
northern Chapel Hill area between 2014 and 2017, if all of these projects were built and
occupied to their approved land use intensities.

B. Approved Background Development Traffic Estimation

Per information from Town of Chapel Hill staff, seven Town-approved developments that are
either currently under construction or are expected to be built out and fully operational by the
2017 design analysis year (or soon after) were studied for the inclusion of specific background
traffic for this report. The seven developments are listed in Table 5, along with their current
status and impact to 2017 traffic volumes.

Figure 8 shows the relative location of the approved background developments. Total approved
background traffic volumes (corresponding to the 2017 Without Site Traffic Scenario) for the
Weaver Crossing study area are shown in Figure 9. Appendix C displays individual
background traffic generator peak hour volumes estimates projected across the Weaver
Crossing project study area. Traffic assignment from these seven developments was estimated
based on information already compiled for The Edge Mixed-Use Development Traffic Impact
Study – 2013 Update, prepared by HNTB in August 2013 and The Children’s Campus of Chapel
Hill Traffic Impact Study prepared in May 2013.

No other proposed/planned development projects were analyzed for specific background traffic
generation impact in the project study area, as several development projects which are currently
active in the Town’s development approval process, or have been approved several years ago
but no activity has commenced, have no certainty of completion by the 2017 analysis year. This
includes the ultimate build-out of The Edge development, the Carolina North project, and the
Town of Chapel Hill Eubanks Park-and-Ride Expansion project. Combined 2017 ambient
growth traffic volume and background approved traffic volume data is shown in Figure 10.

C. Proposed Project Traffic

i. Trip Generation

Projected trips for the proposed Weaver Crossing commercial development were generated
based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 9th Edition,
2012). Adjustments to raw trip generation rates (due to internal trips, pass-by trips, transit trips,
pedestrian/bicycle trips) were made, as appropriate. Trip generation methodologies use the

                                         Weaver Crossing – Proposed Commercial Development

NCDOT recommended practice for each of the proposed land uses regarding equation-based or
rate-based estimation methods.

Table 6 shows the estimated number of vehicular trips generated by Weaver Crossing during
the weekday AM, noon, and PM peak hours of adjacent streets. The table also includes
estimates of daily trip generation for the development. A peak hour truck percentage of two
percent was estimated for all site-generated traffic.

ii.) Adjustments to Trip Generation Rates

   Raw ITE trip generation estimates for daily and peak hour trips are typically adjusted for the
   following factors to reduce raw trip generation estimates to actual estimated vehicular trips
   produced by the Weaver Crossing development.

   a.) Internal Capture
   The land use proposed for Weaver Crossing development might possibly exhibit the
   potential for internally captured trips for the office and commercial on-site uses. However,
   this amount of activity is projected to be small. To be conservative, no reductions were made
   to trip generation results to account for internal capture.

   b.) Modal Split
   Since the study area is well served by several CHT and Triangle Transit fixed bus routes
   with frequent existing service and also has facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists with good
   connectivity to trip attractions in immediate study area, as well as in downtown Chapel Hill
   and the UNC Main Campus, overall combined quantitative trip reduction estimates were
   made for these modes. Based on comparisons with other nearby traffic impact studies and
   consideration of the proposed land uses for Weaver Crossing, a 10 percent trip reduction for
   AM and PM peak hour trips, a five percent reduction for noon peak hour trips (less transit
   service during this time period) and an overall 7.5 percent daily trip reduction for these three
   travel modes was applied to raw daily trip generation estimates.

   c.) Pass-by Trips
   Pass-by trips were accounted for in this study for the commercial retail, pharmacy, and
   drive-in bank land uses. NCDOT recommended PM peak hour pass-by percentages were
   applied to trip generation calculations. No AM peak hour pass-by trip data is available from
   ITE sources or research. Noon pass-by percentages for these three land uses was
   assumed to be 50 percent of PM peak hour data.

   d.) Trip Generation Budget
   Current plans for Weaver Crossing do not specifically designate a phased construction
   process. This analysis considers impacts and recommends improvements for the ultimate
   build-out of Weaver Crossing, with the proposed development intensity as provided by the
   Applicant.

   e.) Existing Development
   The proposed Weaver Crossing development will demolish the existing business (hair salon)
   and several mobile homes on Sparrow Lane. Based on field observation, the amount of
   existing trips generated by this existing development is not significant and no adjustments to
   trip generation methodologies presented above were made to account for this existing traffic
   generation.

iii.) Trip Distribution

Trip distribution for site-related traffic was based existing daily and peak hour traffic patterns to
determine the directional peak hour characteristics of traffic to and from the site from the major
study area thoroughfares. This methodology was applied for both new study area vehicle trips
as well as pass-by trips that would occur along NC 86 and Weaver Dairy Road.

No local trips to/from lower volume collector and residential streets were estimated, though the
possibility exists a small portion of trip-making may occur to/from these local streets. It was
assumed that u-turn movements would likely occur due to access restrictions on the major
thoroughfares and that trips to/from external destinations would use the most convenient route
for those trips, resulting in some trip patterns entering one driveway and exiting another. Local
driveway distribution estimates also include the spatial location of individual land uses and
parking facilities within the Weaver Crossing development. Figures 11A and 11B presents the
projected trip distribution traffic percentages for new trips and pass-by trips, respectively, for the
proposed site in 2017.

iv.) Trip Assignment

Figures 12A and 12B show the corresponding new and pass-by site traffic volumes distributed
on the 2017 study area network. Total volumes into and out of the site correspond to total
external vehicular trips generated, based on the trip generation methodology developed
previously.

D. Future Traffic Forecasts with the Proposed Development

Figures 13A and 13B display the 2017 Build-out+1 year projected study area traffic volumes
with site traffic added. These traffic volumes represent the aggregate traffic growth over
existing traffic volumes for a) ambient traffic growth, b) specific background development traffic
assignments from those developments, and c) estimated site traffic assignments for Weaver
Crossing.


III. IMPACT ANALYSES

A. Peak Hour Intersection Level of Service Analysis

i.) Methodology

Evaluation of traffic operations on suburban arterials is most effective through the determination
of level of service (LOS) criteria. The concept of level of service correlates qualitative aspects
of traffic flow to quantitative terms. This enables transportation professionals to take the
qualitative issues, such as congestion and substandard geometrics, and translate them into
measurable quantities, such as operating speeds and vehicular delays. The 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) characterizes level of service by letter designations A through F.
Level of service A represents ideal low-volume traffic operations, and level of service F
represents over-saturated high-volume traffic operations. Level of service is measured
differently for various roadway facilities, but in general, level of service letter designations are
described by the following in Table 7.

The Synchro Professional Version 7 operations analysis software was used to analyze peak
hour conditions at signalized intersections. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS+ Version
6.0) was used to analyze peak hour conditions at unsignalized intersections. The minimum
acceptable peak hour intersection level of service established for this project is LOS D for
signalized intersections or LOS E for critical movements at unsignalized intersections, or no
increase in delay for signalized intersections operating below LOS D or unsignalized
intersection critical movements operating below LOS E without the inclusion of site traffic. The
following four conditions were evaluated:

Condition 1     - Existing Traffic
Condition 2     - 2017 Traffic without Site Traffic
Condition 3     - 2017 Traffic with Site Traffic Volumes Added
Condition 4     - 2017 Traffic with Site Traffic and Improvements

                                          Weaver Crossing – Proposed Commercial Development

The results of this analysis are based on the procedures presented in the HCM 2010 and
performed with the corresponding capacity analysis software described previously. The
methodology of evaluating each condition for signalized intersections is presented below:

   •   Condition 1 – Use current Town of Chapel Hill data for the cycle length, splits and
       offsets of individual signalized intersections and report LOS and delay values from
       Synchro.

   •   Conditions 2 and 3 – Reoptimize the cycle lengths and splits of individual intersections
       in Synchro, if existing timing data does not provide adequate overall intersection LOS.
       Adjust cycle lengths, splits, and offsets, if necessary, if the signal is currently operating in
       a coordinated system. The optimized signal timing information will be held constant for
       both Conditions, to provide a means to compare effects of the proposed site traffic. No
       changes to free run traffic signal inputs were made for Conditions 2 and 3. For several
       intersections that will experience capacity improvements, individual intersection retiming
       and offsets were implemented.

   •   Condition 4 – Optimize coordinated traffic signals for effects of recommended
       mitigation strategies that change existing/committed changes to lane geometrics.
       Evaluate the potential for different signal phasing schemes (left-turn lag phases, for
       example).     Retain existing split minimums and any pedestrian timing values.
       Recommendations, if warranted, will be made to obtain at least LOS D for the
       intersection as a whole.

The net effect of this process is that direct comparisons, by movement, of delay and LOS
between each of the three conditions are impossible because splits and cycle lengths can and
do change between conditions. The pertinent statistic of this analysis is the overall intersection
level of service and delay. Improvements to deficient intersections in Condition 3 were made by
first attempting to adjust signal operations via changes in cycle lengths, splits and/or with
acceptable adjustments to signal phasing. If that did not produce satisfactory results for all
intersections, geometric improvements to improve intersection capacity were considered for the
deficient intersections. Appendix D contains the Synchro output for all four conditions (where
applicable).

Unsignalized intersections were analyzed directly in HCS. Their results were evaluated on a
per-movement basis, since HCS does not produce an overall intersection level of service for
unsignalized intersections. Thus, intersections with deficient (LOS F) movements in Condition 2
would need to be evaluated for improvements in Condition 3. This methodology differs from
signalized intersections, where one or more movements at an intersection may be deficient in
Condition 2, but as long as the overall intersection level of service does not fall below LOS D, no
intersection improvements are deemed necessary. Appendix E contains the HCS output for all
unsignalized intersections under study.

ii.) Existing Conditions Results

Table 8 presents the results for the existing year traffic conditions as compiled from field data.
The table lists LOS and delay values for those movements that are in existence at this time. It
also only lists data for individual movements encountering delay at the stop-controlled
intersections (which do not have an overall intersection delay value produced by HCS).

Currently, all study area signalized intersections operate at acceptable levels of service for all of
the analyzed 2014 peak hours. Several signalized intersection movements are over capacity in
at least one peak hour during existing conditions. However, overall intersection delays and LOS
are not significantly impacted by these movements, which may have relatively low traffic
volumes.

During Condition 2 - 2017 Without Site Traffic, all study area intersections are expected to still
operate at acceptable levels of service for all analyzed peak hours, though some areas in the
project study area will experience relatively significant traffic growth due to the construction of
background traffic developments. The intersection of NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd) and
Westminster Drive is expected to be upgraded to a four-legged intersection with the completion
of the Charterwood development. All assumptions for improvements related to that project were
taken from the Traffic Impact Study for the Charterwood development and applied to Condition
2. There are no other committed background improvement projects in the project study area that
are expected to be complete by 2017.

iv.) 2017 Build Scenario (Condition 3) Results

Table 10 presents results for 2017 Build-out+1 year estimated traffic conditions, including
impacts of site-related traffic. In general, the addition of site-related traffic will marginally
increase delays at intersections and is not expected to cause additional intersections or critical
intersection stop-controlled movements to drop to deficient levels in the 2017 analysis year.

Primary impacts of site-related traffic will be experienced at the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr.
Blvd) and Weaver Dairy Road intersection. This intersection will still operate at acceptable LOS
for all three peak hours in 2017, though it will be necessary to potentially retime the intersection
to reduce queues for some left-turn/u-turn movements that will face higher traffic volumes.

                                                     Town of Chapel Hill: Traffic Impact Study
                                         Weaver Crossing – Proposed Commercial Development

Additional recommended details for intersection improvements at this location are contained in
Section IV.D but were not specifically analyzed separately in Condition 4.

B. Access Analysis

Vehicular site access is to be accommodated via four driveways connecting to external study
area roadways. Single right-turn in/right-turn out only (RIRO) driveways are proposed along NC
86 and Weaver Dairy Road, respectively. Two additional driveways are shown on concept
plans connecting with existing Sparrow Lane. One of these driveways is a one-way out only
driveway, with the other being a full movement service access driveway. A defined driveway
access system internal to the site is also shown on the concept plan, showing internal
connectivity to surface parking areas and one-way and two-way circulation patterns within the
site development (see Figure 2).

The proposed access concept would provide the following driveway throat lengths:

   •   Site Driveway #1 (NC 86 RIRO) - about 25 feet
   •   Site Driveway #2 (Weaver Dairy RIRO) – about 50 feet
   •   Site Driveway #3 (Sparrow Lane Exit Only) – less than 25 feet
   •   Site Driveway #4 (Sparrow Lane Full Access) – less than 25 feet

Anticipated driveway queues in the 2017 peak analysis hours indicate that all driveways would
typically experience a maximum of one vehicle queued, equating to a minimum storage distance
of 25 feet required. Site Driveway #1 has a current design where exiting vehicles may conflict
with a pedestrian crosswalk at the driveway throat. The internal circulation intersection is very
close (25-50 feet) to the driveway connection with NC 86, but the one-way circulation pattern
should prevent any blockages, provided adequate internal wayfinding signage and stop signs
control movements at the internal four-way circulation intersection.

Driveway distances along NC 86 (for Site Driveway #1) and Weaver Dairy Road (for Site
Driveway #2) from the signalized intersection at NC 86 and Weaver Dairy Road are
approximately 350 feet, and 250 feet, respectively, and are acceptable, based on
recommendations of 100 foot minimum corner clearance as set forth in the 2003 NCDOT Policy
on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways and the 250 foot minimum along
arterial streets specified in the 2005 Town of Chapel Hill Design Manual. The distance between
Site Driveway #1 and Sparrow Lane is approximately 225 feet, slightly less than Town
standards. Town driveway spacing requirements along Sparrow Lane, a local street, are 50 feet
between driveways and street intersection, to which the proposed site plan adheres.

Table 4-A-1 of the Town of Chapel Hill Design Manual also specifies access control standards
for driveways accessing arterials, stating “No access if alternative is possible to street of lower
classification”. This needs to be clarified for the Weaver Crossing project, as it proposes to
access both a major arterial facility and a street of lower classification.

Access for pedestrians and bicyclists is excellent in the project study area. Sidewalk is present
on both sides of N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) throughout the study area and
connectivity is available on at least one side of the street along many facilities in the project
study area that connect to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. Crosswalk exists across the
NC 86 and Weaver Dairy Road signalized intersection and across Weaver Dairy Road
immediately adjacent to the site. The recommended improvements included in the Charterwood
development traffic study also include the upgrade for full pedestrian crosswalk and pedestrian

signals at the NC 86 and Westminster Drive intersection adjacent to the site. Striped bicycle
lanes along NC 86, Weaver Dairy Road, Westminster Drive and the Weaver Dairy Road
Extension currently exist in the project study area. The Weaver Crossing concept plans include
pedestrian crosswalks at driveways and across Sparrow Lane, along with inclusion of sidewalk
along the north side of Sparrow Lane.

C. Signal Warrant Analysis

Based on projected 2017 traffic volumes and current/proposed access plans, no unsignalized
intersection in the project study area would potentially warrant the installation of a traffic signal,
based on the methodology found in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) and the current access spacing and center concrete median island provisions
currently in place along both NC 86 and Weaver Dairy Road.

D. Sight Distance Analysis

In general, sight distance issues entering/exiting the proposed Weaver Crossing site would be
minimal, considering the fact that both NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Weaver
Dairy Road have no horizontal curvature in the vicinity of the proposed project access points
and vertical curvature is currently minimal.

E. Crash Analysis

Data from the NCDOT Traffic Safety Unit was requested for the project study area and was
provided for the time period 6/1/2009 through 5/31/2014. The following section provides
summary statistics for the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Weaver Dairy Road
corridors in the project study area, as well as existing individual study area intersections. Raw
crash data can be found in Appendix F.

N.C. 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr, Boulevard) Corridor
There were 20 crashes reported along the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard study area corridor
between Weaver Dairy Road and Westminster Drive over the five year period (6/1/2009 to
5/31/2014). In this 0.19 mile segment, crash types were primarily angle crashes and rear end
crashes, along with several other crash types. Eight of the 20 crashes were rear-end type
crashes. There were also two bicycle/vehicle crashes over this time span.

Table 11 presents a comparison between the N.C 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard)
corridor study area crash rates and the latest North Carolina statewide rates for the period
2009-2011 (compiled by NCDOT Traffic Safety Unit). Overall, the number of crashes along
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard in the project study area is lower than statewide averages for
similar facilities in every reported category, with the exception of crashes occurring during wet
pavement conditions. The crash severity (number of fatal and injury crashes) is consistently
lower than statewide averages.

Weaver Dairy Road Corridor
There were 36 crashes reported along the Weaver Dairy Road study area corridor between NC
86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and Banks Drive over the five year period (6/1/2009 to
5/31/2014). In this 0.14 mile segment, crash types were primarily angle crashes and rear end
crashes, along with several other crash types. 17 of the 36 crashes were rear-end type
crashes. There were also two bicycle/vehicle crashes over this time span.

Table 12 presents a comparison between the Weaver Dairy Road corridor study area crash
rates and the latest North Carolina statewide rates for the period 2009-2011 (compiled by
NCDOT Traffic Safety Unit). Overall, the number of crashes along Weaver Dairy Road in the
project study area was significantly higher than statewide averages for similar facilities (both
when Weaver Dairy Road was an undivided three-lane cross section prior to recent
improvements and with the new four-lane divided cross-section) in every reported category.
The crash severity for fatal crashes was lower, but the injury crash rate was significantly higher
than statewide averages. Many of the crash issues in this area should be reduced with the
Weaver Dairy Road widening project, which reduced congestion at the nearby NC 86
intersection and provides a divided median.

The NC 86 (Martin Luther King Jr.) intersection with Weaver Dairy Road has the highest rate of
crashes in the project study area, though its rate is less than several other high volume
intersections around Chapel Hill that have been analyzed in other traffic impact studies
Typically, congested conditions during peak travel periods are a cause of higher crash rates and
this intersection experiences more congestion than the other study area intersections, where
minor street traffic volumes are lighter. The recently constructed improvements to the
intersection should have a positive effect on decreasing congestion and lowering the crash rate.

F. Other Transportation-Related Analyses

Other transportation-related analyses relevant to the 2001 Town of Chapel Hill Guidelines for
the preparation of Traffic Impact Studies were completed as appropriate. The following topics
listed in Table 14 are germane to the scope of this study.

G. Special Analysis/Issues Related to Project

Per direction from the Town of Chapel Hill, this traffic impact study was updated in Fall 2014
with new traffic counts for all existing study area intersections. The update to traffic volumes
analyzed in this study was evaluated to test if changes in traffic patterns between Spring 2013
and Fall 2014 affected analysis results and potential recommendations to mitigate traffic
impacts. The updated traffic volumes indicated only minor changes to traffic flow magnitude
between the two time periods and that results and recommendations made for the initial draft
analysis were also valid for this final analysis update.

IV. MITIGATION MEASURES/RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Planned Improvements

There are no Town of Chapel Hill or North Carolina Department of Transportation improvement
projects for study area facilities within the analysis year time frame of 2014-2017.

B. Background Committed Improvements

There are two specific private development projects (Charterwood and The Children’s Campus
of Chapel Hill) that have been approved and are expected to be complete by the 2017 analysis
year that would impact project study area transportation facilities. The proposed site plan
information for Charterwood and corresponding Charterwood Traffic Impact Study, completed
by HNTB in April 2011 included the addition of three site driveways along NC 86 (Martin Luther
King, Jr. Blvd), one of which would form the fourth (western) leg of the existing NC 86
intersection with Westminster Drive. This intersection would also be modified for the following
recommended improvements from that study (see Figure 14 for schematic details):

   •   Construction of a northbound left-turn storage lane in the existing NC 86 median at the
       Westminster Drive intersection with 200 feet of vehicle storage;
   •   Construction of a southbound right-turn deceleration/storage lane at this intersection with
       125 feet of vehicular storage;

                                         Weaver Crossing – Proposed Commercial Development

   •   Provision of a single ingress and two egress lanes eastbound at the Charterwood Main
       Site Driveway. The two egress lanes are to provide at least 100 feet of vehicle storage
       throat length and were analyzed as a shared left-turn/through lane and right-turn lane;
   •   The existing westbound Westminster Drive single lane approach would be restriped for a
       shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane;
   •   The existing signal control at NC 86 and Westminster Drive would be upgraded and
       retimed. Protected left-turn phasing (or protected+permitted left-turn phasing) would be
       added for northbound and southbound left-turn movements).
   •   Pedestrian cross-walks and pedestrian signal heads would be constructed across all
       intersection legs
   •   A bus bay and bus stop along southbound NC 86 would be constructed just south of
       Westminster Drive

The Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill TIS, completed by HNTB in May 2013, recommended an
additional mitigation improvement of retiming the traffic signal at NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr.
Blvd) and Westminster Drive to provide ½ cycled coordinated operation to reduce potential
queues on Westminster Drive from blocking the proposed Children’s Campus of Chapel Hill site
access driveway during peak hours. All of the proposed recommended improvements listed
above were included in the 2017 No-Build and Build analyses for the Weaver Crossing project.

C. Applicant Committed Improvements

Based on the preliminary site plan and supporting development information provided, the only
transportation improvement to be made external to the site itself would be upgrading existing
Sparrow Lane (an unpaved roadway) to Town of Chapel Hill standards for a local street.

D. Necessary Improvements

Based on traffic capacity analyses for the 2017 design year, and analyses of existing study area
turning bay storage lengths and site access, the following improvements are recommended as
being necessary for adequate transportation network operations (see Figure 14).

   1) Monitor and retime the NC 86 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) traffic signals with
      Weaver Dairy Road and Westminster Drive to ensure adequate left-turn/u-turn
      movement green time for the movements impacted by u-turns due to the Weaver
      Crossing project. This improvement is recommended if the Weaver Crossing site is
      developed.
   2) The draft traffic impact study analysis for this report considered the elimination of the
      Site Driveway #1 RIRO access along NC 86. Though traffic operations at this proposed
      intersection do not indicate any deficiencies in the 2017 build-out scenario, exiting right-
      turn movements seeking to make a u-turn downstream at Weaver Dairy Road will have
      to immediately cross three lanes of high volume northbound through traffic in the PM
      peak hour. 95th percentile queue estimates in the 2017 PM peak hour indicate that
      through traffic may potentially block this intersection, as currently located on the site
      plan. Additional discussions with Town and NCDOT staff acknowledged that though
      exiting right-turn blockage may represent a “worst-case” scenario, the allowance for
      right-turn only ingress and egress at this location is permissible provided adequate
      internal wayfinding signage is provided to delineate that the Sparrow Lane exit is also an
      option and that appropriate stop signs and pavement markings control and direct traffic
      movements at the internal four-way circulation intersection located adjacent to this
      driveway connection with NC 86.

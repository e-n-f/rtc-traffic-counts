          Class II Design Review Application - Additional Information Submittal

   Dear Mr. Peter Spir:

   In our original submittal letter dated February 23, 2012 we indicated that we would be submitting the
   following materials under separate cover. Additionally, a CD with all of our Class IT Design Review
   Application materials was requested. We also have updated our site plan drawing to include
   approximate locations of buildings and property lines for adjacent properties. Please find the following
   enclosed:

   CLASS II DESIGN REVIEW APPLICATION:

   3-copies          Preliminary Signage Package
   3-copies          Traffic Impact Analysis
   3-copies          Neighborhood Meeting Minutes (Robinwood Neighborhood Association)
   I-CD              Class II Design Review Application Materials - Electronic Files
   3-copies          Site Plan, AO.l, revision date 2/29/12

   With regard to the preliminary signage morph, it should be noted that the night time view of the front
   elevation includes blue awnings underneath the storefront canopy. The night time elevations were for
   lighting representational purposes only. Please refer to the building elevations originally submitted with
   the application for accurate building elevation information. Please also note that the illuminated
   chevrons shown at either side of the front and rear elevations in the night time view are only intended to
   be raised embellishments in the cement plaster, as shown on page 2 of the signage morph

   If any additional materials or information are required for the review of this application please do not
   hesitate to let me know.

RE:      Transportation Impact Analysis Report for the Proposed West Linn Chase Bank -
         West Linn, Oregon

Dear Mr. Christiansen,

This letter report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis prepared for the
proposed Chase Bank in West Linn, Oregon. This study concludes that the proposed bank can be
developed while maintaining acceptable traffic operations and safety at the study intersections.
Additional details of the methodology, findings and recommendations are provided herein.


INTRODUCTION
Chase Bank is proposing to construct a 4,324 square foot drive-in bank on a parcel previously
occupied by a nursery/garden store. The site is located on the east side of OR 43 in West Linn,
north of the OR 43/Cedar Oak Drive. The site is bound by other commercial developments to the
north and south, and backs to residential parcels to the east. Figure 1 shows the site vicinity map.
Estimated full build-out of the development is expected by 2013. Access to the site is proposed via
a single existing full movement driveway on OR 43. This driveway is shared with adjacent land
uses. Alternative access to OR 43 and to Cedar Oak Drive is provided via existing shared access
with the retail development north and south of the site. Figure 2 shows the proposed
development plan and access locations.


Findings
         Under year 2012 existing traffic conditions, all of the study intersections operate within
         Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) mobility standards during the weekday
         a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
         Under year 2013 background traffic conditions, all of the study intersections operate
         within ODOT mobility standards during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
         The proposed development is estimated to generate approximately 640 weekday daily
         trips of which approximately 55 trips (30 inbound, 25 outbound) will occur during the
         weekday a.m. peak hour and approximately 110 trips (55 inbound, 55 outbound) during
         the weekday p.m. peak hour.

         Adequate intersection sight distance is available at the existing site access driveway.
         The estimated City of West Linn street System Development Charge (SDC) for this project
         is $34,048.

Recommendations
         It is recommended that landscaping, signage and any new above ground utilities along
         the site frontage be located and maintained to provide a clear sight line to the north and
         south from the site driveway. Intersection sight distance should be verified once the
         project is constructed.
         It is recommended that cross access locations between the adjacent commercial properties
         be maintained.

2012 EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The 2012 existing traffic conditions analysis identifies site conditions and the current operational
and geometric characteristics of roadways within the study area. The purpose of this section is to
establish a base condition to compare with future conditions.


Transportation Facilities
As indicated in Figure 1, the study site is located adjacent to OR 43, a three-lane principal arterial
running north-south along the western property line. Cedar Oak Drive, a two-lane collector, is
located 250 feet south of the site. Table 1 provides a summary of adjacent roadway facilities and
regional roadway facilities that are specifically included in the operations analysis of this report.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Sidewalks are available on the east side of OR 43 throughout the study area. Sidewalks are
present on both sides of Walling Circle, Cedar Oak Drive and Hidden Springs Road within 200
feet of OR 43, and on at least one side of those three streets to within a minimum an additional
100 feet. Bicycle lanes are present on OR 43 within the study area. No bicycle facilities are present
on Walling Circle, Cedar Oak Drive and Hidden Springs Road.

Transit Service
Trimet bus route 35: Macadam operates seven days a week on OR 43. This route provides service
between Oregon City, West Linn, Lake Oswego, and Portland on weekdays during the morning
peak period at approximately 25-minute headways, during the weekday mid-day peak period at
approximately 30-minute headways, the weekday evening at approximately 30-minute
headways, on Saturdays at approximately 40-minute headways, and on Sunday at approximately
50-minute headways.


Traffic Volumes and Peak Hour Operations
Based on available traffic information, the types of land uses in the area, and typical commuter
traffic patterns, the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak time periods represent the most critical time
periods for analysis. The traffic operations analysis focused on the average weekday a.m. and
p.m. peak hours of commuter traffic on the adjacent street system.

To evaluate the current transportation system conditions within the site vicinity, manual turning
movement counts were obtained for the study intersections on a mid-week day in January 2012.
These counts were conducted during the weekday morning (7:00 - 9:00 a.m.) and evening (4:00 -
6:00 p.m.) hours. The turning movement counts from the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours were
summarized and rounded to the nearest five vehicles per hour. The weekday morning peak hour
was found to occur between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. while the evening peak hour was found to occur
between 4:40 and 5:40 p.m.

Design Hour Volumes
Per the procedures identified in the ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual (AMP), seasonal growth
factors were applied to the existing volumes to determine the 30 Highest Design Hour Volumes
(DHV) on OR 43. There are no Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATR) within the study area, as such
the Characteristic ATR method in the ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual was used. Based upon
this methodology, a seasonal factor of 1.18 was added to the raw traffic volumes to arrive at the
30 DHV. Attachment "A" contains the traffic count sheets and characteristic ATR methodology
calculations used in this study.


Current Levels of Service
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the
procedures stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 2). A description of level of

service and the criteria by which they are determined is presented in Attachment "B." Attachment
"B" also indicates how level of service is measured and what is generally considered the
acceptable range of level of service.

To ensure that this analysis was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, the peak 15-minute
flow rate during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours was used in the evaluation of all
intersection levels of service. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to
occur for fifteen minutes out of each average peak hour. The traffic conditions during all other
weekday hours will likely operate under better conditions than those described in this report.


Signalized Intersections
The OR 43/Cedar Oak Drive and OR 43/Hidden Springs Road intersections are signalized. OR 43
is owned and operated by ODOT. For ODOT controlled intersections, the amended 1999 Oregon
Highway Plan (Reference 3) requires a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of 0.99 during the peak hour
traffic condition.

Using the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes, v/c ratios, average delays, and levels
of service (LOS) were calculated for the signalized study intersections as shown in Figure 3. As
indicated in the figure, the signalized study intersections all currently operate acceptably during
the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.


Unsignalized Intersections
The remaining study intersections are unsignalized, including the existing site driveway. For
ODOT controlled intersections, the amended 1999 Oregon Highway Plan (Reference 3) requires a
v/c ratio of 0.99 for the major movements and a volume-to-capacity ratio of 0.90 for the minor
movements during the peak hour traffic condition.

The critical movements at each of the unsignalized study intersections currently operate
acceptably during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the existing conditions weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour level of
service results at each of the study intersections. For unsignalized intersections the results shown
represent the critical movement v/c and LOS. Attachment "C" includes the existing conditions traffic
operations worksheets.

Traffic Safety
Crash data from each of the study intersections was reviewed in an effort to identify potential
intersection safety issues. Crash records from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010 were obtained
from ODOT. A summary of the crash data is provided in Table 2.

Crash rates of intersections are often expressed in crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV) for
evaluation purposes. Typically, a crash rate exceeding 1.0 indicates a location requiring further
investigation retailed to traffic safety. Crash rate calculations are presented in Table 3.

The crash data were evaluated to determine if there are any operational or geometric deficiencies
that are potentially contributing to the crash patterns. The OR 43/Cedar Oak Drive and OR
43/Hidden Springs Road intersections have a high proportion of turning movement and rear-end
collisions. A close inspection of the collisions did not reveal any specific directional patterns or
other variables that would require mitigation. The crash history at each of the study intersections
does not indicate inherent safety issues requiring mitigation. It is important to note that our
review of crash data in the study area did not reveal any crashes occurring at the existing site
access driveway to OR 43.

A review of the ODOT Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) revealed that the OR 43/Cedar Oak
Drive intersection is identified as a SPIS intersections. Conversations with ODOT staff indicated
that there is currently no formal plan for mitigation of this intersection. Attachment "D" includes
the crash data summary worksheets.

TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The transportation impact analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will
operate with the development of the subject property in the bank's opening year. The impact of
traffic generated by the proposed development during typical weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour
was examined and summarized in the remainder of this report.


Planned Transportation Improvements and Developments
A review of the City of West Linn 2008 Transportation System Plan (TSP) and the Highway 43
Conceptual Design Plan (Reference 4) were reviewed to determine if there are any future plans to
increase capacity on OR 43 in the site vicinity. While opportunities to widen OR 43 to a five-lane
cross section along the corridor were considered in the TSP and Design Plan, both documents
maintain the existing three-lane cross section for the corridor to maintain the roadway character,
meet concerns of the community and due to existing right-of-way constraints.

Currently the only long range project identified within the study area includes realigning the
existing shopping center driveway on the west side of OR 43 to become the west leg of the OR
43/Cedar Oak Drive intersection. Conversations with City of West Linn staff have revealed that
there are no current in process developments in the vicinity of this project.


2013 Background Traffic Conditions
The background traffic analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system will operate
in the year the development is expected to be completed and occupied. This analysis includes
traffic growth due to development within the study area and from general growth in the region,
but does not include traffic from the proposed bank.


Traffic Volumes
Year 2013 background traffic volumes were developed by applying an annual growth factor to
the 2012 base traffic volumes. The growth factor on OR 43 was derived using ODOT's 2030
Future Year Volume Table. Comparing the base year (2009) and future year (2030) forecasted
volumes for the nearest two locations within the site vicinity, traffic volumes on OR 43 are
projected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 1.6 percent. As such, base year 2012
volumes were grown by 1.6 percent to arrive at 2013 background traffic volumes.


Level of Service Analysis
During the 2013 background traffic conditions, all study intersections are forecast to operate at
acceptable levels during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Figure 6 and Figure 7 illustrate
the year 2013 background traffic operations at each study intersection. Attachment "E" contains the
year 2013 background traffic conditions analysis worksheets.

Proposed Development Plan
Chase Bank is proposing to construct a 4,324 square foot drive-in bank on a parcel previously
occupied by a garden store. The site is located on the east side of OR 43 in West Linn, north of the
OR 43/Cedar Oak Drive.

Trip Generation
Estimates of weekday daily, weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour vehicle trip ends for the proposed
bank were calculated from empirical observations made at other similar developments. These
observations were obtained from the standard reference, Trip Generation: 8th Edition, published by
the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) (Reference 5). It is important to note that the
average trip rates provided in ITE Trip Generation represent a conservative estimate of traffic
associated with banks based on a review of actual bank trip generation data for other locations
around the Pacific Northwest.

A portion of the traffic generated by the proposed bank will be pass-by trips from OR 43. The
pass-by trip rates used in for the bank were obtained from the ITE Trip Generation Handbook
(Reference 6). The Handbook specifies a pass-by rate of approximately 47-percent.

Table 4 summarizes the estimated number of trips that will be generated during a typical
weekday as well as during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Also shown is the reduction
taken to account for pass-by traffic at the site.

As shown in Table 4, the proposed development is estimated to generate approximately 640
weekday daily trips of which approximately 55 trips (30 inbound, 25 outbound) will occur during
the weekday a.m. peak hour and approximately 110 trips (55 inbound, 55 outbound) during the
weekday p.m. peak hour.

Note that no trip credit was assumed in the analysis for capacity assessment purposes; provision
of the trip credit for the previous use will be considered for calculation of the City's System
Development Charges (SDC's) and is discussed later in this letter.


Trip Distribution and Assignment
The distribution of site-generated trips onto the study area roadway system was analyzed by
evaluating existing peak hour directional travel characteristics in the site vicinity. These
characteristics are based on existing turning movement counts at the study intersections and a

select link analysis prepared using Metro's regional transportation planning model. Figure 8
illustrates the resulting estimated trip distribution pattern.

The estimated site-generated traffic was assigned to the surrounding transportation system based
on the trip distribution pattern. The weekday a.m. and p.m. site generated traffic assignments at
the study area intersections are shown in Figure 9 and 10, respectively. It was assumed that a
portion of traffic with southbound OR 43 destinations would exit the site via the signal at the OR
43/Cedar Oak Drive intersection.

Year 2013 Total Traffic Conditions
The year 2013 total traffic volumes include traffic from the development of the proposed bank.
The estimated site-generated traffic shown in Figures 9 and 10 were added to the 2013
background traffic shown in Figures 6 and 7 to arrive at the year 2013 total traffic volumes shown
in Figure 11 and 12.

Figures 11 and 12 summarize the operational analysis results for the study intersections during
the 2013 total weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. As shown in the figures, all study intersections
are forecast to operate at acceptable levels during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak with inclusion
of the proposed bank. Attachment "F" contains the year 2012 total traffic conditions analysis
worksheets.

  QUEUEING ANALYSIS
  A 95th percentile vehicle queuing analysis based on Synchro was performed at the signalized
  study intersections to further evaluate background levels of congestion and ensure that adequate
  vehicle storage space is available with full build out of the proposed bank. Table 5 provides a
  summary of the queuing analysis.

  As shown in Table 5, the background levels of traffic on OR 43 produce 95th percentile vehicle
  queues that exceed available storage in some locations, predominantly for the northbound and
  southbound movements on OR 43 during the respective weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. It is
  important to note that the proposed bank development results in a negligible increase to the
  background condition vehicle queues at these intersections.

  95th percentile queues for the westbound movements at the site access driveway were reviewed to
  determine the potential level of on-site congestion. During the weekday p.m. peak hour the
  forecast 95th percentile queue for this movement is approximately 75 feet. Based on a review of
  the site plan adequate storage space exists for this queue.

  As discussed earlier in this letter, access to the site is proposed via one full access driveway to OR
  43. In addition, access to the OR 43/Cedar Oak Drive traffic signal is available via cross access
  between the proposed bank site and the adjacent commercial property to the south. It is

recommended that cross access locations be maintained to provide drivers access to the traffic
signal at the OR 43/Cedar Oak Drive intersection.


INTERSECTION SIGHT DISTANCE
A site visit was conducted in February 2012 to determine intersection sight distance at the
proposed site driveway. OR 43 has a posted speed limit of 35 mph in this section. The guidebook,
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 2011, 6th Edition, published by the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) (Reference 7) was used to determine
the necessary intersection sight distance. Based on the posted speed of 35 mph, 390 feet of sight
distance is necessary at the intersection. These standards entail that measurements be based on an
estimated driver eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height based on a vehicle height of 4.35 feet
above the road; and is assumed to be 10 feet from the near edge of pavement to the front of a
stopped vehicle. (Actual measurements are taken 15 feet from the edge of travel way).

Photos were taken to show the sight distances from the proposed driveways as follows in Exhibit
1 and Exhibit 2.

       Site Driveway Looking South on OR 43              Site Driveway Looking North on OR 43




Existing intersection sight distance was field measured to be greater than 600 feet facing north
and south direction on OR 43. Based on a review of the site plan, it appears that the building
setback will be sufficient to maintain a clear line of site from the driveway to the north and south.
It is recommended that landscaping, signage and any new above ground utilities along the site
frontage be carefully selected to maintain a clear sight line to the north and south from the site
driveway. It is also recommended that sight distance be verified once the project is constructed.

TURN LANE ANALYSIS
Warrants for a right turn lane were evaluated at the site driveway to OR 43. The analysis was
based on criterion provided in the ODOT Highway Design Manual Appendix F (Reference 8)
during the weekday p.m. peak hour, the combination of right-turn volume, coupled with the
approaching Design Hour Volume (DHV) in the outside lane meets the volume criteria for
installation of a right turn lane at this location.

The proximity of the site access driveway to the OR 43/Cedar Oak Drive intersection limits the
ability to develop a standard right turn per the ODOT Highway Design Manual. Potential
interaction with the existing bike lane would complicate installation of a right turn lane.
Providing a right turn lane at the site driveway is not consistent with the character of OR 43 in the
site vicinity and as such, provision of a right turn lane is not recommended at this time.
Attachment "G" contains the turn lane warrant analysis worksheets.


CITY OF WEST LINN SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES (SDC's)
For the purposes of calculating the City's SDC for this project, supplemental trip generation for
other bank developments around the Pacific Northwest was reviewed. In April 2012, Jake Traffic
Engineering (JTE) prepared the Marylhurst Key Bank Trip Generation and System Development
Charge Letter, documenting trip generation data and the SDC calculation for this site. The JTE
study concluded that similar drive-in banks in the Pacific Northwest generate 10.17 to 14.90
weekday p.m. peak hour trips per thousand square feet. Attachment H contains a copy of the JTE
Trip generation and SDC study.

Assuming these average trip generation rates, and assuming the ITE pass-by rate of 47% the
proposed Chase Bank generates 34 net new weekday p.m. peak hour trips (4,324 s.f./1,000 s.f. x
14.90 x 53%).

The previous use on the site included a 9,400 Nursery Garden Center. The Trip Generation
Handbook does not supply data for pass-by trips associated with the Nursery Garden Center;
however, information provided in the JTE study indicated that a 10% pass-by factor would be
appropriate. Assuming the rates provided in ITE Trip Generation, the trip generation estimate for
the previous Nursery Garden Center is 32 net new weekday p.m. peak hour trips (9,400 s.f./1,000
s.f. x 3.80 x 90%).

Comparing trips associated with the prior and proposed land uses, the proposed Chase Bank is
estimated to generate approximately 2 additional net new weekday p.m. peak hour trips.

The City of West Linn Street SDC table (effective January 26, 2012) indicates a retail SDC rate of
$17,024 per net new trip. Based on the proposed Chase bank trip generation and credit described
above, the total street SDC for this project is estimated to be $34,048. The City of West Linn will
make the final street SDC determination.

LEVEL OF SERVICE CONCEPT 
Level  of  Service  (LOS)  is  a  concept  developed  to  quantify  the  degree  of  comfort  (including  such 
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by 
other  vehicles)  afforded  to  drivers  as  they  travel  through  an  intersection  or  roadway  segment.  Six 
grades are used to denote the various Level of Service from A to F.1 


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS 
The  six  level  of  service  grades  are  described  qualitatively  for  signalized  intersections  in  Table  B1. 
Additionally,  Table  B2  identifies  the  relationship  between  level  of  service  and  average  control  delay 
per  vehicle.  Control  delay  is  defined  to  include  initial  deceleration  delay,  queue  moveup  time, 
stopped  delay,  and  final  acceleration  delay.  Using  this  definition,  level  of  service  D  is  generally 
considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard. 

                                         TABLE B1: LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS (SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS) 

         Level of
         Service                                                    Average Delay per Vehicle
                    Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and 
    A               most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low 
                    delay. 
                    Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally 
    B               occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher 
                    levels of average delay. 
                    Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher 
                    delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. 
    C 
                    The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without 
                    stopping. 
                    Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence 
                    of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long 
    D 
                    cycle length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. 
                    Individual cycle failures are noticeable. 
                    Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually 
    E               considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, 
                    long cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences. 
                    Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This 
    F               condition often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual 
                    cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS 
Unsignalized  intersections  include  two  way  stop  controlled  (TWSC)  and  all  way  stop  controlled 
(AWSC)  intersections.  The  2000  Highway  Capacity  Manual  provides  models  for  estimating  control 
delay  at  both  TWSC  and  AWSC  intersections.  A  qualitative  description  of  the  various  service  levels 
associated with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B3. A quantitative definition of level 
of service for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B4. Using this definition, Level of Service 
E is generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  level  of  service  criteria  for  unsignalized  intersections  are  somewhat 
different  than  the  criteria  used  for  signalized  intersections.  The  primary  reason  for  this  difference  is 
that  drivers  expect  different  levels  of  performance  from  different  kinds  of  transportation  facilities. 
The  expectation  is  that  a  signalized  intersection  is  designed  to  carry  higher  traffic  volumes  than  an 
unsignalized  intersection.  Additionally,  there  are  a  number  of  driver  behavior  considerations  that 
combine  to  make  delays  at  signalized  intersections  less  onerous  than  at  unsignalized  intersections. 
For  example,  drivers  at  signalized  intersections  are  able  to  relax  during  the  red  interval,  while  drivers 
on  the  minor  street  approaches  to  TWSC  intersections  must  remain  attentive  to  the  task  of 
identifying  acceptable  gaps  and  vehicle  conflicts.  Also,  there  is  often  much  more  variability  in  the 
amount  of  delay  experienced  by  individual  drivers  at  unsignalized  intersections  than  signalized 
intersections. For these reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of 
service  is  less  for  an  unsignalized  intersection  than  for  a  signalized  intersection.  While  overall 
intersection level of service is calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for 
the  minor  approaches  and  the  major  street  left  turn  movements  at  TWSC  intersections.  No  delay  is 
assumed  to  the  major  street  through  movements.  For  TWSC  intersections,  the  overall  intersection 
level of service remains undefined: levelofservice is only calculated for each minor street lane. 

In  the  performance  evaluation  of  TWSC  intersections,  it  is  important  to  consider  other  measures  of 
effectiveness  (MOE's)  in  addition  to  delay,  such  as  v/c  ratios  for  individual  movements,  average 
queue  lengths,  and  95thpercentile  queue  lengths.  By  focusing  on  a  single  MOE  for  the  worst 
movement  only,  such  as  delay  for  the  minorstreet  left  turn,  users  may  make  inappropriate  traffic 
control  decisions.  The  potential  for  making  such  inappropriate  decisions  is  likely  to  be  particularly 
pronounced when the HCM levelofservice thresholds are adopted as legal standards. 


VOLUMETOCAPACITY CONCEPT 
The  Highway  Capacity  Manual  2000  defines  capacity  as  "the  maximum  number  of  vehicles  that  can 
pass  a  certain  point  during  a  specified  period  under  prevailing  roadway,  traffic,  and  control 
conditions."  Capacity  analysis  examines  segments  or  points  (such  as  signalized  intersections)  of  a 
facility  under  uniform  traffic,  roadway,  and  control  conditions.  These  conditions  determine  capacity; 
therefore,  segments  with  different  prevailing  conditions  will  have  different  capacities.  Capacity  is  not 
the  absolute  maximum  flow  rate  ­  driver  characteristics  vary  from  region  to  region,  and the  absolute 
maximum capacity can vary from day to day and location to location.

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS 
Capacity  at  signalized  intersections  is  defined  for  each  lane  group.  The  lane  group  capacity  is  the 
maximum  hourly  rate  at  which  vehicles  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  pass  through  the  intersection 
under  prevailing  conditions.  The  ratio  of  flow  rate  to  capacity  (v/c),  often  called  the  volume  to 
capacity  ratio,  is  typically  referred  as  to  the  degree  of  saturation.  The  critical  v/c  ratio  (also  known  as 
the  intersection  v/c  ratio)  depends  on  the  conflicting  critical  lane  flow  rates  and  the  signal  phasing, 
and considers only the lane groups that have the highest flow ratio (v/s) for a given signal phase.  

The  Oregon  Highway  Plan  Action  1F.6  identifies  maximum  v/c  thresholds  for  signalized  intersections 
for areas within and outside of MPO areas. These are summarized below in Table E5 and Table E6.

  The volume to capacity ratios in the table are for the highest two consecutive hours or weekday traffic volumes. This is calculated by dividing the 
traffic volume for the average weekly twohour PM peak by twice the hourly capacity.

  Thresholds shown are for interim purposes only; refinement plans for these corridors are required in Metro Regional Transportation Plan and will 
include a recommended motor vehicle performance policy for each corridor. 




UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS 
For  unsignalized  intersections,  capacity  is  determined  using  a  gap  acceptance  model  which  calculates 
the  potential  capacity  of  each  minor  traffic  stream  in  accordance  with  Equation  173  in  the  Highway

Capacity Manual 2000. The potential capacity of a movement is a function of the conflicting flow rate 
expressed as an hourly rate, as well as the minorstreet movement. 

The  Oregon  Highway  Plan  Action  1F.1  identifies  maximum  v/c  thresholds  for  unsignalized 
intersections.  As  stated  on  page  75,  "At  unsignalized  intersections  and  road  approaches,  the  volume
tocapacity  ratios  in  Tables  6  and  7  shall  not  be  exceeded  for  either  of  the  state  highway  approaches 
that are not stopped. Approaches at which traffic must stop, or otherwise yield the right of way, shall 
be  operated  to  maintain  safe  operation  of  the  intersection  and  all  of  its  approaches  and  shall  not 
exceed  the  volume  to  capacity  ratios  for  District/Local  Interest  Roads  in  Table  6  within  the  urban 
growth boundaries or 0.80 outside of urban growth boundaries."

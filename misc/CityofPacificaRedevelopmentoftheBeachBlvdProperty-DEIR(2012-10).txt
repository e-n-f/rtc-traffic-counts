             DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT
       REDEVELOPMENT OF THE BEACH BOULEVARD PROPERTY

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the City of Pacifica Planning and Economic
Development Department, acting as lead agency, is circulating a Draft Environmental
Impact Report (DEIR) for public comment on the Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard
Property. This notice is provided pursuant to noticing requirements found in the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15087 and the California Public
Resources Code Section 21092.

PROJECT TITLE: Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property

PROJECT LOCATION: The project site is located at 2212 Beach Boulevard in the
City of Pacifica, California (APN: 016-204-020 and APN 016-294-510).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The City of Pacifica is proposing the redevelopment of a
3.5 acre, publicly-owned property located at 2212 Beach Boulevard in the City of Pacifica
(the proposed project). The City is proposing to rezone the site to allow for a mixed-use
development that would include an approximately 36,500 square-foot library, and up to 84
attached residential units, a boutique hotel of up to 75 rooms, and a waterfront restaurant
of up to 4,500 square feet. The library will have a large meeting space which will also
function as the City Council chambers and multipurpose meeting room for the community.

Development of the library will be managed directly by the City of Pacifica and San Mateo
County. For the remaining portions of the site, the City expects to enter into a negotiated
sale (public-private partnership) with one or more private developers, who will then build
the residential and commercial (hotel and restaurant) portions of the project per a
development and disposition agreement (DDA) or other binding agreement. Based on
market conditions and preferences of the private developer, the ultimate development
program may be less for any particular land use. Therefore, for this EIR, the land uses
identified represent an estimate of the future uses and a maximum envelope that future
development will not exceed, and will likely be less than the building program described
herein.

The site is the former location of Sharp Park Waste Water Treatment Plant (SPWWTP).
When the Calera Creek Water Recycling Plant was completed in 2000, the SPWWTP was
demolished. A majority of the site has been cleared, but there are four buildings that
remain on the site. All of the buildings are proposed to be removed with the exception of
the City of Pacifica pump station (approximately 8,100 square feet) located along the
northern edge of the property.

ANTICIPATED ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS: The DEIR indicates that there will
be no significant environmental effects on the environment that cannot be reduced to a
less-than-significant level. The project is not located on any of the lists of sites enumerated
under Section 65962.5 (Hazardous Sites) of the Government Code.
PUBLIC REVIEW PERIOD: The 45-day public review period for the DEIR begins on
Wednesday, October 10, 2012 and concludes on Monday, November 26, 2012.

DEIR DOCUMENT AVAILABILITY: The DEIR is available for review at the
following locations: 1) City of Pacifica, Planning and Economic Development Department,
1800 Francisco Boulevard, Pacifica, CA 94044; 2) The Pacifica Sanchez Branch of the San
Mateo County Library, 1111 Terra Nova Boulevard, Pacifica, CA 94044; 3) and online at
www.cityofpacifica.org

REQUEST FOR COMMENTS: Due to the time limits mandated by State law, your
response must be sent at the earliest possible date, but no later than November 26,
2012.

Please send your response to Lee Diaz, Associate Planner, at City of Pacifica, Planning and
Economic Development Department, 1800 Francisco Boulevard, Pacifica, CA 94044. E-

NOTICE OF DEIR PUBLIC MEETING: In addition, pursuant to California Public
Resources Code §§ 21081.7, 21083.9, and 21092.2, the City of Pacifica Planning
Commission will conduct a public DEIR meeting for the same purpose of soliciting the
views of interested parties requesting notice, responsible agencies, agencies with jurisdiction
by law, trustee agencies, involved federal agencies, and the City of Pacifica, as to the
adequacy of the DEIR. The meeting will be held on Monday, December 3, 2012

Executive Summary
This summary provides a brief description of the proposed project, project alternatives, and
all potentially significant impacts identified during the course of the environmental analysis
performed for the project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
and the State CEQA Guidelines. This summary is intended as an overview and should be
used in conjunction with a thorough reading of the Draft EIR (EIR). The text of this report,
including figures, tables and appendices, serves as the basis for this summary.

Summary of the Proposed Project
Location
The proposed project is located in the Sharp Park neighborhood of the City of Pacifica.
The project site is bounded by Montecito Avenue to the north, Palmetto Avenue to the
east, Birch Avenue to the south, and Beach Boulevard frontage to the west. Currently, site
access and parking is provided from Beach Boulevard on the west and Montecito Avenue
from the north. A gated entry is also located from the west off Palmetto Avenue.
Project Description
The City of Pacifica is proposing the redevelopment of a 3.5 acre, publicly-owned property
located at 2212 Beach Boulevard in the City of Pacifica (the proposed project). The City is
proposing to rezone the site to allow for a mixed-use development that would include an
approximately 36,500 square-foot public library with internal cafe, a boutique hotel of up to
75 rooms, a waterfront restaurant of up to 4,500 square feet, and up to 84 attached
residential units. The library's main façade will be on Palmetto Avenue, and the building will
contain, computers and a digital lab, an expanded range of books and resources, a large
meeting space which will also function as the City Council chambers and multipurpose
meeting room for the community.

The project's objectives include building a new library and other active uses on Palmetto
Avenue (the City's designated main street); enhancing opportunities for the public to enjoy
the coast through a beachfront restaurant, and improved streets and sidewalks; and
redeveloping an underutilized site in the heart of one of Pacifica's oldest neighborhoods.
The proposed project has been developed through a process that has involved public input
and meetings, and a partnership between the City of Pacifica and San Mateo County.
Development and operation of the library will be managed directly by the City of Pacifica
and San Mateo County. For the remaining portions of the site, the City expects to enter
into a negotiated sale (public-private partnership) with one or more private developers,
who will then build the residential and commercial (hotel and restaurant) portions of the
project per a development and disposition agreement (DDA) or other binding agreement.
Based on market conditions and the final agreement between the City and developer, the
amount of housing, hotel rooms, and commercial space may be less than the amount
identified above. Therefore, for this EIR, the land uses identified represent an estimate of
the future uses and a maximum envelope that future development will not exceed, with
the final build out possibly being less than the building program described herein.

                                                                                        Page ES-1
Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property Draft EIR
Executive Summary


The project site is the former location of Sharp Park Waste Water Treatment Plant
(SPWWTP). When the Calera Creek Water Recycling Plant was completed in 2000, the
SPWWTP was demolished. A majority of the project site has been cleared, but there are
four buildings that remain on the site. All of the buildings are proposed to be removed
with the exception of the City of Pacifica pump station (approximately 8,100 square feet)
located along the northern edge of the property.

Because this project is within the Coastal Zone of Pacifica, this project requires City
approval of a Coastal Development Permit. The proposed project will also require a
General Plan Amendment, a Zoning Change and a Site Development Permit by the City of
Pacifica.

Areas of Known Controversy
To date there has been substantial public controversy associated with the conversion of a
parcel that has been historically used for recreational purposes. Approximately four letters
were received on the Notice of Preparation that identified a range of issues for inclusion in
the Draft EIR, which are included in Appendix A of the Draft EIR. These issues have been
addressed herein.

Summary of Project Environmental Impacts
Table S-1: Executive Summary of Project Impacts, which begins on the following page,
provides a summary of the proposed project's potentially significant impacts, the level of
significance of the impact before mitigation, the mitigation measures proposed to reduce or
avoid potentially significant effects, and the level of significance of the impact after
mitigation.

Aesthetics
Impact 3.1-1: Implementation of the proposed         Less than Significant   No Mitigation Measures are necessary.          Less than Significant
project would alter the existing aesthetic
character of the area by intensifying
development within the project site. However,
the type of development is consistent with the
guiding policies of the General Plan. In addition,
the proposed project would be subject to
applicable zoning regulations. The City of
Pacifica has design guidelines to ensure quality
and compatible development and the proposed
project would be developed as a Planned
Development requiring careful site planning and
design, which would be reviewed by the
Planning Commission. Future development
associated with the proposed project would be
subject to these guidelines and regulations, as
well as the City's design review process, which
would ensure that the proposed project does
not degrade the visual character of the project
site and surrounding area.

Government Code Section 65962.5. However,
operation of the former Sharp Park Waste
Water Treatment Plant facility resulted in
contamination at the project site. Based a
review of historical site investigations at the
project site, the levels of detected chemicals of
potential concern and the depth of these
chemicals do not appear to represent a risk to
redevelopment of the project site. Furthermore,

proposed project would include construction of
residential uses, including approximately 84
townhomes. Residential development would be
required to comply with disclosure requirements
in the City of Pacifica Municipal Code.

Impact 3.81: The proposed project could              Less than Significant   No Mitigation Measures are necessary.          Less than Significant
result in short-term construction-related noise
and vibration (e.g. building demolition and
construction) that could exceed applicable noise
standards at nearby noise sensitive land uses.


Impact 3.8-2: The proposed project would             Less than Significant   No Mitigation Measures are necessary.          Less than Significant
result in an increase noise levels slightly from
mobile sources (i.e. vehicular traffic) generated
by the proposed project.

Public Services
Impact 3.9-1: The proposed project would              Less than Significant   No Mitigation Measures are necessary.   Less than Significant
not significantly increase the need for fire or law
enforcement protection services, which would
not result in the need for the construction of
new or physically altered facilities in order to
meet the City's response times for fire
protection services.


Impact 3.9-2: The proposed project would              Less than Significant   No Mitigation Measures are necessary.   Less than Significant
increase the population and could potentially
increase the number of students within the
Pacifica School District and the Jefferson Union
High School District. However, the proposed

the proposed development on the project site
would not substantially increase the amount of
stormwater runoff that would require an
expansion of existing facilities.


Impact 3.9-6: The proposed project would
generate increased solid waste. However, based
on projected population, the proposed project is
not anticipated to exceed the capacity of the Ox
Mountain Sanitary Landfill and/or result in the
inability to provide solid waste services.


Transportation and Circulation
Impact 3.10-1: The proposed project would          Less than Significant   No Mitigation Measures are necessary.          Less than Significant
reconfigure the existing Beach Boulevard (a
public roadway) and add new internal project
roadways which has the potential to increase

Summary of Cumulative Considerable Effects
The proposed project would result in a potentially significant transportation and circulation
impact. All of the project study intersections would operate at an acceptable level of
service during the AM and PM peak hours with the exception of the intersection of
Oceana Boulevard and Paloma Avenue, which would operate at LOS F and would satisfy
the peak hour volumes traffic signal warrants adopted by Caltrans. This impact is primarily
associated with the residential potion of the proposed project due to residents who would
be commuting north (likely to work) during the AM peak period. Mitigation Measure 4-1
would require that prior to any final residential occupancy permit for residential portion of
the project, the project applicant shall implement restriping and bicycle facility
improvements at the Oceana Boulevard and Paloma Avenue intersection as follows:

                    Eastbound Approach (Paloma Avenue): Provide a 75 foot exclusive
                    right-turn lane on the eastbound approach by removing on-street
                    parking on the north side of Paloma Avenue. This distance will
                    accommodate the anticipated right-turn lane 95th percentile queue,
                    approximately 3 vehicles.
                    Westbound Approach (Paloma Avenue): Restripe the westbound
                    approach of Paloma Avenue to include an exclusive left-turn lane and a
                    shared through / right-turn lane.
                    Provide Class-III bicycle facility signage and pavement markings in both
                    the eastbound and westbound directions on the Paloma Avenue bridge
                    between Oceana Boulevard and Francisco Boulevard.
Summary of Alternatives
CEQA Guidelines require that an EIR describe and evaluate alternatives to the project that
could eliminate significant adverse project impacts or reduce them to a less-than-significant
level. The following alternatives are evaluated in this EIR in the Chapter 4 ­ CEQA
Considerations.

       Alternative #1 ­ No Project Alternative
       Alternative #2 - Civic and Residential Focus Alternative
       Alternative #3 ­ Civic and Commercial Focus Alternative
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e)(2) requires that the environmentally superior
alternative be identified. If the environmentally superior alternative is the No Project
Alternative, the EIR shall identify an environmentally superior alternative among the other
alternatives. Alternative #2 ­ Civic and Residential Focus Alternative would be the
environmentally superior alternative as it would reduce impacts to air quality, noise, and
transportation due to a reduction in the amount of vehicle trips.

1. Introduction
1.1.    Purpose
This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) addresses the potential environmental effects of
Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property in accordance with the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the State CEQA Guidelines. A full description of
the proposed project is described in Chapter 2: Project Description.

This EIR focuses on evaluation of the following environmental issue areas:

       Aesthetics and Visual Resources
       Air Quality
       Geology and Soils
       Greenhouse Gas and Climate Change
       Hazards and Hazardous Materials
       Hydrology and Water Quality
       Land Use and Planning
       Noise
       Public Services, Utilities, and Service Systems
       Transportation and Traffic


This EIR has been prepared in accordance with State CEQA Guidelines. As stated in the
CEQA Guidelines, an EIR is an "informational document" with the intended purpose to:
"inform public agency decision-makers and the public generally of the significant
environmental effects of a project, identify possible ways to minimize the significant effects,
and describe reasonable alternatives to the project." Although the EIR does not control
the ultimate decision on the proposed project, the City must consider the information in
the EIR and respond to each significant effect identified in the EIR through findings in
conjunction with any project approval. As defined in Section 15382 of the CEQA
Guidelines, a "significant effect on the environment" is:

       "...a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the
       physical conditions within the area affected by the project, including land, air,
       water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic or
       aesthetic significance. An economic or social change by itself shall not be
       considered a significant effect on the environment. A social or economic
       change related to a physical change may be considered in determining
       whether a physical change is significant."



                                                                                           Page 1-1

Introduction


1.2.       Environmental Review Process
The review and certification process for the EIR will involve the following procedural steps:

Notice of Preparation
In accordance with Section 15063(a) of the CEQA Guidelines, the City of Pacifica
determined that an EIR would be necessary for the proposed project; therefore an Initial
Study was not prepared. In accordance with Section 15082(a) of the CEQA Guidelines,
the City of Pacifica circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) to responsible and trustee
agencies and to the San Mateo Clerk Recorders office for a period of 30-days in order to
solicit comments on the scope of the EIR regarding the proposed project.

The comment period of the NOP was from June 25, 2012 to July 24, 2012. A total of
three comments letters were received on the NOP from the following agencies: CA
Department of Fish & Game, Caltrans, and the City/County Association of Governments of
San Mateo County. Concerns raised in response to the NOP were considered during
preparation of the Draft EIR and the comment letters are included in Appendix A.

Draft EIR
The Draft EIR contains a description of the proposed project, description of the
environmental setting, identification of project impacts and effects found not to be
significant, mitigation measures for impacts found to be significant, an analysis of cumulative
impacts, and an analysis of project alternatives.

Upon completion of the Draft EIR, the City filed a Notice of Completion (NOC) with the
State Office of Planning and Research, in accordance with Section 15085 of the CEQA
Guidelines.

Public Notice/Public Review
The Draft EIR has been published and circulated for review and comment by the public
and other interested parties, agencies and organizations for a 45-day review period from
October 10, 2012 through November 26, 2012. Concurrent with the Notice of
Completion (NOC), the City provided a public notice of the availability of the Draft EIR for
public review in accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15087(a), and invited
comments from the general public, Responsible and Trustee Agencies, organizations, and
other interested parties. Notice of the time and location of a City meeting to receive
comments on the Draft EIR will be published prior to the hearing.

All comments or questions regarding the Draft EIR should be addressed in writing to:

Response to Comments/Final EIR
Following the public review and comment period for the Draft EIR, a Final EIR will be
prepared. The Final EIR will respond to comments received during the public review and
comment period. The City will review and consider the Final EIR prior to the decision to
approve, revise, or reject the proposed project or an alternative to the proposed project.

Certification of the Final EIR
If the City of Pacifica finds that the Final EIR is "adequate and complete" the City of Pacifica
may certify the Final EIR. The rule of adequacy generally holds that the EIR can be certified
if: 1) it shows a good faith effort at full disclosure of environmental information, and 2)
provides sufficient analysis to allow decisions to be made regarding the project in
contemplation of environmental considerations.

Project Consideration
After review and consideration of the Final EIR, the City of Pacifica may act upon the
proposed project. A decision to approve the proposed project would be accompanied by
written Findings in accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15091 and, if applicable,
Section 15093 (Statement of Overriding Considerations).

1.3.    Report Organization
Sections 15122 through 15132 of the CEQA Guidelines identify the content requirements
for Environmental Impact Reports. Among other things, an EIR must include: a description
of the proposed project and environmental setting; an environmental impact analysis;
mitigation measures; alternatives to the proposed project; identification of significant
irreversible environmental changes; growth-inducing impacts; and cumulative impacts.

The scope of environmental issues addressed in the Draft EIR were established through the
preparation of environmental documentation and supporting technical reports developed
for the proposed project, and public agency responses to the NOP and comments
received.

This Draft EIR is organized in the following manner:




                                                                                          Page 1-3

This section also addresses alternatives to the proposed project and cumulative impacts.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR describe a range of reasonable
alternatives to the proposed project, which could feasibly attain the basic objectives of the
project and avoid and/or lessen the environmental effects of the project. The alternatives
analysis compares the proposed project with three selected alternatives, which include the
following:

       Alternative #1 ­ No Project Alternative;
       Alternative #2 ­ Civic and Residential Focus Alternative
       Alternative #3 ­ Civic & Commercial Focus Alternative


Impacts associated with cumulative development were analyzed based on the proposed
project's effects in combination with a cumulative projects list (pending development
projects) provided by City staff. The City's cumulative project list, which includes an
approved mixed use project, includes approximately 1,235 square feet of commercial/retail
and 60 residential units in the City.

Section 5.0 ­ Report Preparers and References
This section provides a list of all authors and agencies that assisted in the preparation of the
report by name, title, and company or agency affiliation. It also itemizes supporting and
reference data used in the preparation of the Draft EIR and lists all governmental agencies,
organizations, and other individuals consulted in preparing the EIR.

Appendices
This section includes all notices and other procedural documents pertinent to the EIR as
well as all technical reports prepared in support of the analysis.

1.4.    Impact Terminology
This Draft EIR uses the following terminology to describe environmental effects of the
proposed project:

       Standards of Significance: A set of criteria used by the lead agency to determine at
       what level, or "threshold", an impact would be considered significant. Significance
       criteria used in this EIR include the CEQA Guidelines and Statutes; factual or
       scientific information; regulatory performance standards of local, state, and federal
       agencies; and the goals, objectives, and policies of the City of Dublin General Plan.
       Less Than Significant Impact: A less than significant impact would cause no
       substantial change in the environment and no mitigation is required.
       Potentially Significant Impact: A potentially significant impact may cause a substantial
       adverse change in the physical conditions of the environment. Mitigation measures



                                                                                          Page 1-5
Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property Draft EIR
Introduction


           and/or project alternatives are identified to reduce project effects to the
           environment.
           Significant Impact: Significant impacts are identified by the evaluation of project
           effects using specified standards of significance. Mitigation measures and/or project
           alternatives are identified to reduce project effects to the environment.
           Significant Unavoidable Impact: A significant and unavoidable impact would result in
           a substantial change in the environment for which no feasible mitigation is available
           to reduce the impact to a less than significant level, although mitigation may be
           available to lessen the degree of the impact.
           Cumulative Impact: Cumulative impacts refer to two or more individual affects
           which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase
           other environmental impacts.

2. Project Description
2.1.    Project Overview
The City of Pacifica is proposing the redevelopment of a 3.5 acre, publicly-owned property
located at 2212 Beach Boulevard in the City of Pacifica (the proposed project). The City is
proposing to rezone the site to allow for a mixed-use development that would include an
approximately 36,500 square-foot public library with internal cafe, a boutique hotel of up to
75 rooms, a waterfront restaurant of up to 4,500 square feet, and up to 84 attached
residential units. The library's main façade will be on Palmetto Avenue, and the building will
contain, computers and a digital lab, an expanded range of books and resources, a large
meeting space which will also function as the City Council chambers and multipurpose
meeting room for the community.

The project's objectives include building a new library and other active uses on Palmetto
Avenue (the City's designated main street); enhancing opportunities for the public to enjoy
the coast through a beachfront restaurant, and improved streets and sidewalks; and
redeveloping an underutilized site in the heart of one of Pacifica's oldest neighborhoods.
The proposed project has been developed through a process that has involved public input
and meetings, and a partnership between the City of Pacifica and San Mateo County.
Development and operation of the library will be managed directly by the City of Pacifica
and San Mateo County. For the remaining portions of the site, the City expects to enter
into a negotiated sale (public-private partnership) with one or more private developers,
who will then build the residential and commercial (hotel and restaurant) portions of the
project per a development and disposition agreement (DDA) or other binding agreement.
Based on market conditions and the final agreement between the City and developer, the
amount of housing, hotel rooms, and commercial space may be less than the amount
identified above. Therefore, for this EIR, the land uses identified represent an estimate of
the future uses and a maximum envelope that future development will not exceed, with
the final build out possibly being less than the building program described herein.

The site is the former location of Sharp Park Waste Water Treatment Plant (SPWWTP).
When the Calera Creek Water Recycling Plant was completed in 2000, the SPWWTP was
demolished. A majority of the site has been cleared, but there are four buildings that
remain on the site. All of the buildings are proposed to be removed with the exception of
the City of Pacifica pump station (approximately 8,100 square feet) located along the
northern edge of the property.

Because this project is within the Coastal Zone of Pacifica, this project requires City
approval of a Coastal Development Permit. The project will also require a General Plan

Project Description



2.2.       Project Location and Setting
Project Site Location
The proposed project is located in the Sharp Park neighborhood of Pacifica. The site is
bounded by Montecito Avenue to the north, Palmetto Avenue to the east, Birch Avenue
to the south, and Beach Boulevard frontage to the west (see Figure 2-1: Regional Location
and Figure 2-2: Aerial of Existing Project Site). Currently, site access and parking is
provided from Beach Boulevard on the west and Montecito Avenue from the north. A
gated entry is also located from the west off Palmetto Avenue.
Project Setting
As part of waste water treatment plant facility demolition activities, most features
associated with the former treatment plant were removed, including a significant volume of
soil from the center of the property (up to 10 feet from the original surface grade in some
places). As a result, site topography has been changed significantly at various locations.
Surface elevations at the site vary from approximately 13 to 20 feet above mean sea level
(ft. msl). Depth to groundwater varies from 7 to 14 feet below surface grade (ft. bsg)
(TEC Environmental, 2012). The project site offers significant view opportunities of the
beachfront and Pacific Ocean.

The project site formerly housed equipment and buildings associated with the SPWWTP.
Most of the facilities associated with the treatment plant (buildings, equipment storage and
underground tanks) were demolished following the construction of the Calera Creek
Water Recycling Plant (CCWRP) located approximately 1.5 miles south of the project site,
west of Highway 1 and Reina Del Mar Avenue.

As shown in Figure 2-3: Project Site Parcel Map, four structures remain on site: The
Administration Building and the Chlorine/Pump Station Building have been constructed
with adjoining walls and are located on the northwest corner of the property. The
Administration Building is a two-story structure with a footprint of roughly 4,400 square
feet. The building exterior has a Spanish design including arches along the building frontage
and red tile roofing. The lower floor is vacant and formerly housed mechanical equipment,
office and laboratory space, a conference room/lunch room, a locker room and restrooms.
The second floor is currently used by the City of Pacifica as Council Chambers and includes
a Council conference room, restrooms, and storage space.

The Pump Station Building is an approximately 8,100 square foot building located east of
the Administration Building. The Sharp Park pump station is housed in the basement and
the east end of the building which also contains a garage and workshop. It pumps
wastewater from all of Pacifica north of the Fairway Park neighborhood to the CCWRP.
The lower floor contains mechanical and electrical equipment rooms, a loading bay and a
grit room for the former SPWWTP operation. The building also includes a janitor's
restroom and shower. The building footprint encompasses roughly 5,100 square-feet,
roughly half of which is used by the Sharp Park pump station. The building's stucco
exterior and red tile roofing match the adjoining Administration Building.

                                                                              Project Description



The Thickening Building is a single-story structure located on the southern end of the
project site. The building footprint is roughly 3,300 square feet and is constructed in the
same exterior design as the Administration and Pump Station buildings. The building is
presently vacant and formerly housed equipment processing wastewater sludge generated
from the plant operations. The Thickening Building was surveyed for asbestos in 1991.
Asbestos containing material was found in the floor tile mastic (see Chapter 3, Hazards and
Hazardous Materials, below).

The fourth building on the project site is a small garage located at the southeastern corner
of the property. The garage was used as an equipment maintenance work area for the
SPWWTP. The building is approximately 2,000 square-feet.

A stucco wall exists along the northern, eastern, and western property boundary. An
active six-inch sanitary sewer line extends from west to east through the center of the site
and within the existing Pacific Avenue right-of-way. A 55-space public parking lot is located
on the western side of the property, west of Beach Boulevard.

Approximately one-third of the project site is covered by impervious surface (e.g. parking
lot, buildings, and pavement). The remainder of the project site contains disturbed soils.
Images of the project site are shown in Figure 2-4: Photographs of the Existing Project Site.

Surrounding Land Uses
As shown in Figure 2-5: Surrounding Land Uses, land uses surrounding the project site is
characterized by urban development. Single- and multi-family residential uses occur directly
north and south of the property. Retail commercial uses are located on both sides of
Palmetto Avenue. Hilton Way (or Sharp Park) Library is located east of Palmetto Avenue
on Hilton Way.

The Palmetto Avenue Streetscape Improvement Plan (PASIP) was completed in October
2009 and is scheduled to start construction in March 2013. The PASIP extends from
Paloma Avenue south to Clarendon Road. The PASIP includes a number of streetscape
improvements including street and corner bollards, trees, benches, and new street light
fixtures.

West of the project site, an oceanfront pedestrian promenade is located on the west side
of Beach Boulevard along the Pacific Ocean. This is a very popular regional pedestrian
pathway that is used for walking, jogging, biking, etc. The Rev. Herschell Harkins Memorial
Pacifica Pier (Pacifica Pier) is a popular fishing pier located at the west end of Santa Rosa
Avenue. The L shaped concrete pier extends a quarter mile into the Pacific Ocean.

2.3.    Zoning and Land Use Designations
As shown on Figure 2-3: Project Site Parcel Map, the project property comprises two
parcels (APN 016-204-020 and APN 016-294-510), an existing public parking lot that is
accessed from Beach Boulevard and Montecito, and a right of way easement for a future
Pacific Avenue roadway. The total site acreage is 3.5 acres.

As shown in Figure 2-6: General Plan Land Use Map, the project site is designated Public
Facilities (P-F) in the City General Plan/Local Coastal Plan. The project site is also zoned P-
F.

2.4.    Project Objectives
The objective of the proposed project is to reposition the project site to become a
centerpiece of the redevelopment and revitalization of the Palmetto Avenue "main street"
and the West Sharp Park Neighborhood, and to better connect the City's designated main
street to the promenade and beach. The City engaged a multidisciplinary planning team
led by Leland Consulting Group, urban strategists, to complete an assessment of the site, a
public outreach program, and identify the preferred land uses and development program
for the site to achieve the City's goals.

This planning process was conducted between June and November 2011. The outreach
used to inform the plan included stakeholder interviews in small groups, two public open
houses, a web site through which public comment could be submitted, and presentations
to and discussions with the City Council. Stakeholders who participated in the process
included residents from the West Sharp Park and other Pacifica neighborhoods, Palmetto
Avenue business and property owners, and library staff and foundation members. The
planning team's findings are summarized in the Beach Boulevard Property Redevelopment
Strategy (April 2012).

Following the City Council's adoption of the Beach Boulevard Property Redevelopment
Strategy, the City and County engaged another consulting team to create conceptual
designs for the library. This planning process was guided by a combined City-County
advisory committee, and included a number of public workshops, and additional
opportunities for written public input.

The City's objectives of the proposed project site are as follows:

       Create a public-private development project that acts as a catalyst for the further
       revitalization of Palmetto Avenue, the City's designated main street, and a street
       intended to be a commercial center and community gathering place.
       Create an active and vibrant public-private development project that is readily
       recognized as a positive economic and social feature by the community of Pacifica.
       Improve connections between Palmetto Avenue and the waterfront--including the
       Beach Boulevard Promenade, Pier, beach, and open spaces to the south. This will

                                                                                         Page 2-5
Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property Draft EIR
Project Description



             connect Pacifica's commercial and cultural hub to the community's greatest natural
             asset--the ocean.
             Take advantage of the oceanfront views on the western edge of the property with
             uses that attract both local residents and visitors.
             Make better use of a relatively large site that is publicly-owned, underutilized, and
             located in the heart of one of the Pacifica's most historic neighborhoods.
             Provide a location for a new City library that includes community rooms and
             meeting space that can also be used as the new City Council chambers.
             Create active retail corners, including retail space located within the library.
             Entitle a high-quality development project that provides long-term economic return
             to the City.
             Create high quality plazas, sidewalks and an interior pedestrian street.
             Ensure that the entitlements and regulations that apply to the site (General Plan,
             zoning, etc.) are appropriate and will allow the public and private development
             envisioned by the Beach Boulevard Property Redevelopment Strategy. Where
             necessary, modify regulations to fit the strategy.
2.5.            Project Characteristics
Proposed Land Uses
The proposed project is comprised of a mix of complementary uses that meet the project
objectives identified above and was approved by the Pacifica City Council in October 2011
as part of the Beach Boulevard Property Redevelopment Strategy. Land uses include a new
library, a boutique hotel, a restaurant, housing, and parking, each of which are described
below and in Table 2-1: Proposed Land Uses. Figure 2-7: Conceptual Land Use Plan
provides and illustration of the proposed project.

                                                                          (may be integrated into hotel)
Notes:
1. Includes 500 to 2,000 sf of retail uses within the Library building.

Development Process
Development of the library will be managed directly by the City of Pacifica and San Mateo
County. For the remaining portions of the site, the City expects to enter into a negotiated

Page 2-6
                                          Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property Draft EIR
                                                                              Project Description



sale (public-private partnership) with one or more private developers, who will then build
the residential and commercial (hotel and restaurant) portions of the project per a
development and disposition agreement (DDA) or other binding agreement. Based on
market conditions and preferences of the private developer, the ultimate development
program may be less for any particular land use. Therefore, for this EIR, the land uses
identified represent an estimate of the future uses and a maximum envelope that future
development will not exceed, and will likely be less than the building program described
herein.
Pacifica Library
The City currently has two libraries: one at Hilton Way, directly across the street from the
subject site, and another approximately four miles south on Terra Nova Boulevard in the
Linda Mar neighborhood.

The City, in coordination with San Mateo County Library, conducted a Pacifica Library
Needs Assessment in 2011 (Anderson Brulé Architects, 2011). Based on comparisons
with library districts of comparable size and location, the consultant team and citizens
concluded that the current library was severely undersized and offered an inadequate array
of services.

The new library will be approximately 36,500 square-feet on two floors. It will include
space for reading and studying, community meeting rooms, internet access, books, and
other resources. A large meeting room (3,000 square feet) will also double as the City
Council Chambers. Approximately 500 square-feet of retail may be included within the
library building and will likely be located at the corner of Montecito and Palmetto Avenues.
The building height is estimated to be approximately 35'. One level of below grade parking
is planned as a part of the library building. The remainder of the required parking will be
surface parking behind the building.

The building and interior plans for the library have received more detailed attention to this
point than those than for the rest of the site. San Mateo County Library has hired an
architecture firm and conducted a number of focused community meetings to address
building programming and facilities (see Figure 2-8: Library Conceptual Perspective and
Floor Plans). However, the library design process is still ongoing at this time, and some
relatively minor adjustments to the building program are likely to be made going forward.

Residential
Up to 84 housing units are proposed for the project site. The housing will be attached
units that will range in size and scale from two-story townhomes to three or four story
podium style units over parking. Full floor building heights will not exceed 45 feet, though
view towers, or smaller projections may exceed this height in order to add architectural
interest to the buildings.




                                                                                        Page 2-7
Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property Draft EIR
Project Description


Boutique Hotel
A boutique hotel of between 35 and 75 rooms is proposed along the western edge of the
project site, adjacent to Beach Boulevard. A boutique hotel is a small hotel with a unique
niche or stylish theme to help differentiate it from the competition and make it a unique
destination. The location of the project site on the waterfront, near the Pacifica Pier, Beach
Boulevard Pedestrian Promenade and Palmetto Avenue create a unique site that is well
suited to this type of use. The building will be two or three stories, and up to 45 feet in
height.

Waterfront Restaurant
A full service restaurant of up to 4,500 square feet is proposed along the southwestern
edge of the project site, adjacent to Beach Boulevard. The restaurant will be either a
standalone one-to-two story building, approximately 35 feet in height, or be integrated into
the boutique hotel structure.

City of Pacifica Pump Station
The existing pump station located adjacent to Montecito Avenue will remain on site and
continue to operate as a pump station.

Circulation, Access, and Parking
Circulation
At present, there is no vehicular circulation through the site. The project would add
several multimodal roadways through the site, all of which will be designed to enhance
pedestrians' walking experience, while encouraging automobiles to travel slowly through
pavement design and in some cases relatively narrow lane widths.

The proposed project will create Pacific Avenue, an east-west multimodal link from
Palmetto Avenue to the Beach Boulevard. While this roadway will be accessible by
vehicles, it will function as a linear public plaza and include special pavement treatments,
narrow intersections, street trees, special lighting and pedestrian amenities such as benches,
trash receptacles, etc. The design will purposefully constrict vehicles (e.g. curbing, street
trees, etc.) requiring them to move slowly and thereby ensure safe use by pedestrian and
bicyclists.

The proposed project will add two north-south alleyways through the site from Montecito
Avenue to Birch Lane. The westerly alley will be one-way north while the easterly alley will
be one-way south. These two alleys will provide access to the interior of the project site.

As part of the proposed project, the westerly property line along Beach Boulevard will be
reconfigured to allow more efficient use of the space and improve circulation and parking
along Beach Boulevard.

Access
The California Coastal Act emphasizes enhancing public access to the coast. This will be
achieved at the site through building Pacific Avenue, a new multimodal and pedestrian
friendly street, improving the streetscape and parking on Montecito Avenue, and by
providing bicycle parking on the project site.

Transit service along Palmetto Avenue is provided by the SamTrans #112 bus. Additional
bus lines in the immediate area (within 0.3 miles of the project site) include SamTrans
route #s 110 and 140. Additionally, SamTrans #118 is a high-frequency commuter bus
that connects to the regional BART system.

Parking
Public Parking
The general public currently uses parking on and adjacent to the site to access the Pacifica
Promenade, beach and pier, Palmetto Avenue merchants, and other destinations. Table 2-
2: Public Parking, below shows the public parking that is available now and following
redevelopment of the site.

The Beach Boulevard parking lot currently has 54 spaces. Of these, 20 are associated with
on-site use of the Administration Building (City offices and Council Chambers), however
these spaces are often used by the public, particularly when there is no City Council
meeting. As part of the proposed project, this parking will be relocated to the western
edge of Beach Boulevard in order to allow site redevelopment. In addition, parking on
Montecito Avenue will be reconfigured from parallel to angled parking, netting an additional
seven spaces on the block between Beach Boulevard and Palmetto Avenue. Following
redevelopment, there will be a net addition of four public spaces.

On-site Project Parking
Parking requirements are regulated by the City of Pacifica Municipal Code (Section 9-
4.2818). These regulations prescribe parking for each respective land use, as shown below
in Table 2-3: Parking Demand & Supply Analysis for Proposed Project. Special
consideration for mixed-use developments (as is proposed), is allowed under these
regulations, as follows:

                                                                                                                     Page 2-9
Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property Draft EIR
Project Description



      1. Where two (2) or more uses under the same or different owners and/or managers
         are located in the same structure and/or in a common development, the sum of the
         separate requirements for each use shall be provided. In the event of multiple uses,
         the Planning Commission may require areas of less intensive use to provide a higher
         parking requirement if it is determined that the health, safety, and general welfare of
         the area requires the higher standard. No parking space, or portion thereof, shall
         serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise authorized by
         the Planning Commission.
      2. In cases where shared uses complement each other, parking requirements may be
         reduced as determined by the Planning Commission.


Given the fact that the proposed project is a mixed-use development and located within a
walkable, relatively urban environment, parking standards for shared-use development were
utilized. Because the City does not have a specific shared-use parking standard for mixed-
use residential and retail development, parking standards for "suburban center/town
centers", were used based standards endorsed by the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission (MTC 2007). 1

                                                                                Project Description



dedicated to that use, though there will be some shared parking, particularly between the
boutique hotel and restaurant.

Library parking (77 spaces) will be shared with events taking place in the multipurpose
room (e.g. City Council meetings, community functions, etc.), typically during the evenings.
Because the peak library use occurs from noon to 6:00 p.m., and most council meetings
and other community events will occur in the evenings, the library and multipurpose room
will be a shared parking facility.

Parking for housing will include 106 below-grade spaces and 18 surface spaces. Parking for
the boutique hotel will be a combination of five surface spaces and ~50 below-grade
spaces. 19 surface spaces will be allocated for the restaurant.

The number of spaces represent the maximum to be provided; if less of a given land use is
built (i.e. fewer housing units than the maximum possible on the site), then fewer parking
spaces would be constructed. It should be noted that the final parking plan may vary
depending on the ultimate development program and densities developed on the site.

Some parking will be located along interior access alleys; however, no parking will be
provided along Pacific Avenue in order to enhance this street's pedestrian-oriented nature.

Infrastructure Improvements
As shown in Figure 2-10: Existing Utilities and Services, existing infrastructure including
water, sewer and storm drainage facilities are readily accessible to the project site. A 27-
inch sewer line extends west on Montecito Avenue and into the pump station. A six-inch
sewer line also extends along Birch Lane. The eight-inch sewer line that extends along the
Pacific Avenue right-of-way and a portion of Palmetto Avenue would likely be removed as
part of project construction.

As part of final grading and site plan, surface water will flow east to west across the site and
be intercepted by a 21-inch storm drain that extends via a pipeline into the Pacific Ocean.
Prior to discharge into the storm drain, all surface water will be detained and treated
consistent with local and state water quality requirements.

Water service and other utility services including gas, electricity, cable, etc.        is readily
accessible from the existing adjacent public roadways.

Site Demolition and Preparation
Building and Improvements Demolition
As part of redevelopment, the entire site, with the exception of the pump station, would
be re-graded. The existing Administration Building, the abandoned Sludge Thickening
Building, and the abandoned Garage would all be demolished and removed from the site.
Additionally, the existing perimeter wall and miscellaneous materials would be removed.


                                                                                         Page 2-11

Project Description



Existing vegetation, which includes ruderal grasses, shrubs, and a few trees would also be
removed.

Soils and Groundwater Assessment and Remediation
As part of the SPWWTP facility demolition in 2000, most features associated with the
former treatment plant were removed, including a significant volume of soil from the center
of the property (up to 10 feet from the original surface grade in some places). As a result,
site topography has been changed significantly at various locations. Ground water levels
could potentially be on the order of 10 to 20 feet below street level depending on the
time of year construction begins. Depending on the actual depth of the basement or
garage excavations, temporary dewatering may be necessary during construction.

Following the demolition of the SPWWTP, the City engaged several environmental science
and geotechnical firms to analyze potential soil contamination, impacts on human health,
and other related issues. A chronology of the main studies completed is described above
(See Section 2.2, Site History).

These investigations found (as summarized in the Soil and Groundwater Management Plan
(SGMP), TEC Environmental, 2012) that chemicals of potential concern (COPCs) at the
site are related to an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons from a former
underground storage tank (UST) and house-keeping issues at a former hazardous waste
storage area (HWSA). COPCs include total petroleum hydrocarbons quantified as diesel
(TPHd) and as motor oil (TPHmo). In addition, concentrations of various metals above
assumed background levels have been identified, including chromium and cobalt.

However, based on environmental site investigations at the site, the levels of detected
chemicals of potential concern and the depth of these chemicals do not appear to
represent a risk to the proposed future use of the site, including residents. Detected
concentrations were below or only slightly above the most stringent residential ESLs.
Furthermore, the physical properties of the COPCs are such that vapor intrusion risks are
not of concern for future mixed use (commercial and residential) redevelopment of the
site.

The location of these contaminants is shown in Figure 2-11: Areas of Potential Impacted
Soil and/or Groundwater, and are within the zones designated for boutique hotel and
housing development. No known soils contaminants have been identified within the area
designated for library development.

In 2010, following studies completed between 2001 and 2009, the San Mateo County
Groundwater Protection Program (GPP) issued two site closure letters. These letters
indicate that the GPP will not oppose new residential or commercial development on the
site, assuming no new soil contaminants are found, and that contaminated soils are
disposed of properly.

                                                                                Project Description



Despite the fact that contamination risks are very low, the SGMP recommends a number
of actions be taken during project construction to safeguard against potentially hazardous
soil, groundwater, and/or airborne conditions. These policies and procedures must be
followed by the City and County as they develop the library site and/or infrastructure, and
by private developers who complete the other components. Those conducting site
development should consult the SGMP for a complete set of recommendations, which
include the following:

Soils
        All on-site workers will be trained by an environmental professional (EP) prior to
        construction to be made aware of the potential contaminants, areas previously
        identified as containing impacts materials and procedures for handling any impacts
        materials should they be discovered.
        No contaminated soil will be removed from the site for offsite re-use. All disturbed
        soils generated during construction activities will be re-used on site if not
        contaminated, or disposed at an appropriate landfill.
        All disturbed soils will be monitored on an ongoing basis by observing visual and
        olfactory indicators of contamination. If contaminated soil is encountered, they will
        be tested and, if necessary, transported under hazardous waste manifest protocols
        to an appropriate landfill.
        During construction, all appropriate storm water and sediment control best
        management practices (BMPs) will be used to prevent discharge of contaminated
        materials to the Pacific Ocean.
        Disturbed soils will be further isolated from potential physical contact (dermal,
        ingestion) using engineered controls including concrete subgrade parking garages or
        concrete slab on-grade foundations.
Groundwater
        Groundwater will require analysis prior to discharge or off-site disposal to confirm
        compliance with any discharge permits and approvals or to determine suitable
        treatment and disposal options.
        If groundwater discharge to the City of Pacifica sanitary sewer is necessary, it will be
        conveyed through a treatment system (appropriately sized storage tank[s] and
        carbon canisters) prior to discharge under permit. The number of carbon canisters
        used will be sufficient to meet discharge permit requirements. Discharge sampling
        and analyses will also be completed in accordance with discharge permit
        requirements.
        Should concentrations of COPCs in any collected groundwater prevent discharge
        to the sanitary sewer, the extracted groundwater will be containerized in
        appropriately sized storage tanks profiled for off-site disposal in accordance with the
        accepting facility permit requirements and transferred by truck off the site

                                                                                         Page 2-13
Redevelopment of the Beach Boulevard Property Draft EIR
Project Description



        accordingly. Contaminated groundwater determined to be nonhazardous will also
        be disposed at an appropriate facility, but does not require hazardous waste
        handling procedures for transportation.
Airborne Contaminants
        Although no known airborne risks have been identified at the site, efforts will be
        made to minimize the generation of potential airborne contamination while working
        in areas known to contain COPCs. The EP will be responsible for evaluating the
        potential for air quality issues related to suspect contamination encountered.
        The project's environmental manager will be responsible for conducting perimeter
        air monitoring (upwind and downwind) during periods of objectionable odors or to
        investigate odor related complaints. If perimeter monitoring indicates the presence
        of an odor issue, vapor mitigation will be implemented (e.g. cover stockpiles with
        plastic sheeting, use clean soil to cover excavation, etc.).


Project Phasing and Construction
Project construction is anticipated to occur in phases depending on the timing
requirements of the San Mateo Library, market conditions, and interest by the
development community. Given the fact that the architectural plans and program is well
progressed for the library, it is possible that it will be constructed prior to the remaining
portions of the project. Should the library be constructed first and separately from the rest
of the site, sufficient parking and all necessary infrastructure improvements will be
constructed accordingly.

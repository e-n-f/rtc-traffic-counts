Subject:             South Kirkland Park-and-Ride Transit Oriented Development Traffic and Parking
                     Assessment

This memorandum provides information to help inform the City’s on-going efforts to consider
amendments to the Zoning and Municipal Codes. These would ultimately include new transit
oriented development (TOD) standards, design guidelines and/or regulations, and related code
amendments to implement existing Comprehensive Plan policies. While this assessment is
approached in a conservative manner consistent with SEPA traffic studies, the actual SEPA
review would occur at a later stage in the process. The work to-date has been coordinated with
City of Kirkland, City of Bellevue, and King County Metro staff.


TOD/Park and Ride Development Assumptions
The South Kirkland Park-and-Ride is located on the northwest corner of the 108th Avenue
NE/38th Place NE intersection, at the southern boundary of the City of Kirkland. The park-and-ride
lot contains approximately 600 designated parking stalls. King County currently owns and
operates the seven acre park-and-ride. Approximately half of the seven acre park-and-ride is
located within the City of Kirkland, while the
remainder is located in the City of Bellevue.

The TOD project is anticipated to include up
        1
to 250 multi-family units, 12,500 square-feet
of commercial use, and 250 additional park-
and-ride stalls for a total of 853 park-and-ride
stalls.

For the purpose of this assessment it is
assumed that approximately 20 to 50 percent
of the multi-family units are anticipated to be
affordable housing. Parking for the multi-
family units and commercial use would be
provided by additional stalls dedicated to the
TOD project as well as through shared
parking with the park-and-ride facility. Access
to the site is assumed to continue via the two
existing full access driveways along 38th
Place NE and 108th Avenue NE.

    The final residential unit count will be determined through King County’s Request for Proposal (RFP) process.
Executive Summary
           Benefits of TOD – The development of TOD typically results in improved mobility by
            locating housing near transit services, reducing vehicle miles travelled for the region
            due to higher transit use, and improving air quality by reducing trip-making and trip
            lengths.
           Benefits of the Park-and-Ride – Provision of additional spaces within the park-and-
            ride will contribute to reducing regional vehicle demand for trips downstream of the
            park-and-ride by converting auto trips to transit trips and reduce off-site parking
            related to users parking along the transit routes.
           Localized Impacts – There is no significant change to off-site intersection operations
            anticipated to occur with development of the TOD and park-and-ride expansion, and
            mitigation is not likely to be triggered based on the current City standards.
           Access Improvements – A combination of providing additional capacity such as
            signalization at the 108th Avenue NE/NE 38th Place intersection and implementation
            of turn restrictions at the 108th Avenue NE may be required. The extent of these
            improvements are contingent on the final development plan and anticipated trip
            generation.
           Parking Requirements - When defining the required parking supply for the project,
            we recommend a baseline assumption of 1.08 stalls per unit, consistent with the
            Redmond data, with provisions to adjust the required parking supply to account for
            reductions due to senior and affordable housing components, as well as the ability to
            share parking with the park-and-ride facility. If overflow from the TOD is anticipated,
            the current utilization of the Park-and-Ride facility should be observed and the ability
            for shared parking confirmed.


Project Approach
The proposed TOD project and increase in park-and-ride parking supply represents one element
of the region’s future transportation strategy to make more efficient use of limited resources. While
the technical analysis that follows is largely focused on the localized transportation impacts that
could occur, the TOD proposal can be viewed in the larger context of smart growth planning.

TOD Housing Development Considerations
While the analysis that is contained herein presents a conservative picture of the nature of
potential localized impacts of added housing on the site, there is a substantial amount of research
that has been published regarding the potential benefits of TOD projects. These benefits include
(but are not limited to):
           Increase Mobility – Improved mobility options within congested areas occurs when
            housing development is located proximate to regional transit service. The South
            Kirkland Park-and-Ride facility provides transit service to the entire region, and a quick
            connection to the regional employment centers of Seattle and Bellevue.
           Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) – A critical metric for many Transportation
            Management Programs for employment facilities focuses on reducing overall VMT.
            This can occur through reduced trip generation, as well as through shortening of
            vehicle trips.
           Improved Air Quality – Linking housing development with access to transit would
            result in reduced emissions through both reduced trip-making (vehicle trip generation)




                                                                                                       2
            and reduced trip lengths when housing is located within the urbanized area instead of
            suburban or rural locations.
           Provide Affordable Housing Opportunities/Reduced Auto Demand – Not only
            does a TOD project such as this contribute to the supply of affordable housing, but
            also its location adjacent to park-and-ride/transit facilities reinforces the opportunity to
            reside in such housing without the need for an automobile. This results in a significant
            reduction in both vehicle trip generation and the parking supply needed to directly
            serve the housing.

The regional benefits to TOD projects can be significant, although there is often some increase in
localized impacts in the immediate vicinity of the TOD project. The detailed analysis that follows is
largely focused on helping to understand the localized impacts of the TOD component and the
increased size of the park and ride facility. However, a TOD should also be considered in the
context of the overall regional smart growth strategies.

Park-and-Ride Considerations
Similar to the discussion above regarding the TOD component of the proposal, the proposed
increase in parking associated with the park-and-ride facility could accommodate additional and
future travel demand that would otherwise be making an auto trip, and would serve those parking
and accessing the transit system at other locations due to the high utilization currently experienced
at the South Kirkland Park-and-Ride. In all cases, since the proposal is simply to increase the
supply of parking, no new regional travel demand would occur as a result of the increased parking,
it would simply accommodate demand already on the system, effectively diverting trips from other
routes. The majority of these regional trips would be attracted from SR 520 and I-405. A lesser
proportion would be diverted from local streets near or adjacent to the site, such as Lake
Washington Boulevard, 108th Avenue NE, and Northup Way. These travel patterns to the park-
and-ride facility would result in the following impacts and benefits:
           Reduced Regional Auto Demand – Increasing the transit share of regional travel
            marginally (i.e., by auto trips being converted to park-and-ride users) improves the
            travel environment for all remaining travel modes on the system, including single
            occupant autos and high occupancy vehicles (HOV), especially for that portion of the
            regional trip “downstream” from the park-and-ride facility (i.e. to the west on SR 520).
           Minor Increases in Local Access Traffic – As traffic from other routes is reoriented
            to the park-and-ride facility, minor increases in local access traffic would occur.
           Reduced Off-Site Parking – While the level of current off-site parking is unknown,
            there have been comments from the community that such parking occurs as a result
            of the parking supply limitations of the existing park-and-ride. Increasing the on-site
            parking supply would reduce the demand for transit access parking that occurs
            elsewhere along transit routes serving the park-and-ride.

Overall, the combined development of proposed TOD (with an affordable housing component) and
the increase in parking supply of park-and-ride facility would:
           Further King County/Metro’s and the City’s goals to facilitate smart growth through
            encouraging development with reduced trip making characteristics
           Result in localized impacts associated with vehicle access that would be addressed in
            more detail at the project proposal/SEPA evaluation stage of the development
            process.

The remainder of the technical review is primarily focused on understanding the likely level of local
impacts and how those impacts should inform zoning requirements. As mentioned above, the



                                                                                                        3
detailed project-specific SEPA evaluation, including the City of Kirkland transportation concurrency
review, would be conducted as part of a separate review process.

Local Traffic Impacts
This section describes the potential traffic volume and intersection operation impacts associated
with a potential project (inclusive of the TOD and increase in park-and-ride stalls). The evaluation
focuses on the weekday PM peak hour (of the adjacent street system) consistent with the City of
Kirkland requirements and the final traffic analysis conducted by Washington State Department of
Transportation (WSDOT) as part of their
coordination on SR 520 with the City of Bellevue.

The year 2030 was selected for analysis of the
impacts of the long term affects of the proposed
rezone because it is consistent with the horizon
year for the regional transportation modeling that
supports the SR 520 improvements (tolling, etc.);
thus, the analysis gives decision makers the best
sense of how the proposal will integrate with the
long term transportation vision. SEPA review and
concurrency analysis will occur at a later stage,
and be based on the City of Kirkland TIA
procedures.

The scope of this study includes an evaluation of a
number of key intersections along Bellevue Way
and Lake Washington Boulevard as illustrated on
the map located to the right. Several of the study
area intersections are under the City of Bellevue
jurisdiction.

Trip Generation
The potential project has two primary components: residential/retail mixed-use and the park-and-
ride expansion. The following provides a summary of the assumptions made in regards to the
development of trip generation estimates for the project.

TOD Component. As identified in multiple research studies, TOD housing projects have a lower
vehicle trip generation rates when compared to stand alone residential projects due to the location
of the projects near transit service. Research has shown that TOD housing results in up to 50
percent fewer trips than non-TOD housing due to residents using transit rather than personal
         2,3
vehicles . There is also a component of affordable housing to be included in the TOD project.
                                                                                               4
Studies show that auto ownership for affordable housing residents (i.e., lower incomes) is less . To
account for the affordable housing as well as the transit oriented nature of the residential
                                                                           th
component, the trip rates published in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8 Edition, were reduced
by 40 percent. The detailed calculations are shown in Table 1.

Due to the presence of the retail use, there is also an element of trip internalization between uses
that needs to be considered. Internal trips that would occur within the site between the apartment

and retail and park-and-ride and retail uses were estimated for purposes of developing overall off-
site trip generation. An internal trip reduction of approximately 4 percent or 13 trips was calculated
                                                   nd
using the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2 Edition. In addition to internalization of the residential
/retail trips, a portion of the retail trips are typically assumed to be pass-by trips i.e., trips already
on the adjacent roadway system that would travel to and from the retail. Based on the ITE Trip
Generation Handbook, 34 percent of the retail trips were assumed to be pass-by.

Park-and-Ride Facility. As discussed in the introduction to this memorandum, park-and-ride lots
are not anticipated to generate new traffic on a regional scale. The purpose of a park-and-ride is to
attract existing traffic in the area, concentrate it at one location, and transfer people to transit. As a
result, there would be some localized impact in the immediate vicinity of the project, and an overall
benefit to the region’s transportation system. With the tolling of SR 520 scheduled to begin spring
2011, park-and-ride demand is expected to increase. To evaluate the potential impacts of the
park-and-ride component of the project, it was assumed that 50 percent of the park-and-ride trips
would be diverted from an existing route in the immediate vicinity while the remaining 50 percent
would be a “new trip” within the limits of the study area.

Traffic counts were conducted at the park-and-ride driveways on December 15, 2010 from 4:00 to
6:00 p.m. to develop an existing trip rate per stall for the South Kirkland Park-and-Ride during the
weekday PM peak hour of the adjacent street network. Although the parking lot is typically fully
occupied during the day, the weekday peak hour represents when traffic volumes to and from the
driveway and on the surrounding roadway system would be highest. Attachment A provides the
park-and-ride traffic counts. This data showed that for the existing 603 stall park-and-ride there
was a total of 303 vehicle trips (inbound and outbound) during the weekday PM peak hour of the
adjacent street or 0.50 trips per stall (see Attachment A).

Table 1 provides a summary of the trip generation estimated for the TOD project. Detailed trip
generation calculations are provided in Attachment B. As shown in the table, the potential TOD
and park-and-ride project would generate 194 net new weekday PM peak hour trips.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The project-related trips were assigned to the roadway network based on existing travel patterns
and the Bellevue Kirkland Redmond (BKR) travel demand model. Given the differences in the
travel behaviors for the TOD (apartments and retail) and park-and-ride components, a separate
distribution was determined for each. Attachments C and D display the distribution for the TOD
and park-and-ride. Traffic was assigned to the study area based on the travel patterns as shown
on Attachments E and F.

2030 Traffic Volume Forecasts
Forecast Methodology. Baseline 2030 traffic volumes for the weekday PM peak hour were
provided by WSDOT and are based on the BKR travel demand model and work completed as part
of the coordination with Bellevue on the SR 520 project. For locations not included in the SR 520
evaluation, an annual growth rate of two percent per year was applied to the existing traffic
volumes based the forecasted growth from the travel demand model. This growth rate is
conservative when considering a 20year forecast, but it is inclusive of general background growth
as well as changes in travel patterns that may result from the SR 520 project. As mentioned, 2030
was selected as the analysis year to assure consistency with the long term regional planning and
anticipated improvements to SR 520. Project-specific SEPA analysis and concurrency review at a
later stage. Attachment A includes the existing weekday PM peak hour intersection turning
movement counts for the site access locations and the 108th Avenue NE/NE 38th Place
intersection. Attachment G shows the baseline 2030 traffic volumes for the study area. Project
traffic volumes were added to the future baseline traffic volumes to develop the 2030 with-project
traffic forecasts. Attachment H shows the weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study
intersections.

Proportionate Share. Table 2 summarizes the anticipated total intersection traffic with the project
as well as the percent of future with-project volume attributable to the proposed project during the
weekday PM peak hour. As shown in the table, the TOD and park-and-ride would increase traffic
locally along 108th Avenue NE, NE 38th Place, and Northup Way. However, traffic would
decrease along Lake Washington Boulevard in the vicinity of the SR 520 interchange since the
additional park-and-ride stalls would attract users that may have otherwise travelled to and from
Seattle via SR 520.

In addition to the intersection impacts shown in Table 2, impacts on key corridors include:
           Lake Washington Boulevard. North of NE 38th Place, the TOD/Park-and-Ride
            expansion traffic is anticipated to constitute approximately 0.6% of the project 2030
            volumes.
           108th Avenue NE. North of the South Kirkland Park-and-Ride Driveway, the TOD/Park-
            and-Ride expansion traffic is anticipated to constitute approximately 2.8% of the project
            2030 volumes.

The amount of TOD/Park-and-Ride expansion traffic volumes anticipated along Lake Washington
Boulevard and 108th Avenue NE are within the range of day-to-day traffic fluctuations.

Traffic Operations Impacts
Methodology. Traffic operational analysis was conducted for 2030 traffic forecasts at the study
intersections defined for this analysis. The City of Kirkland’s adopted intersection LOS standard is
LOS D. Based on the City’s Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines (February 2004), they generally
define a SEPA impact requiring mitigation at a signalized location where the project’s proportional
                                                                                          5
share of daily intersection traffic related to the capacity of the intersection represents :
           More than 15 percent at intersections operating at LOS E
           More than 5 percent at intersections operating at LOS F

Although this analysis is not being prepared for SEPA purposes, review of the City’s thresholds is
reasonable criteria to apply. The Lake Washington Boulevard/NE 38th Place intersection is the
only signalized study intersection located in the City of Kirkland. The City of Bellevue does not
have an adopted intersection LOS standard; however, LOS D/E are generally considered
acceptable.

Results. The results of the with-project analysis were compared to the 2030 baseline conditions to
identify long range localized traffic impacts associated with the proposal. The analysis assumes
that by 2030 WSDOT completes improvements at the SR 520 interchanges as well as tolling of
SR 520. Table 3 summarizes the future with and without-project LOS for the weekday PM peak
hour. Detailed LOS worksheets are included in Attachment I.

As shown in the table, several intersections are forecast to operate at LOS E/F in the future with or
without the proposed project.

The 108th Avenue NE intersections with the park-and-ride access and NE 38th Place are
anticipated to operate poorly due to the increase in vehicles to and from the site as well as the
anticipated growth along the 108th Avenue NE corridor. In order to enhance access to and from
the TOD and park-and-ride, intersection improvements would be needed at these locations.
Potential improvements to these locations would include:
               Access Restrictions at the 108th Avenue NE Driveway: Depending on the final
                project level of development and future traffic growth, the 108th Avenue NE driveway
                would likely need to have some access restrictions. The actual restriction should be
                determined in conjunction with the on-site design to ensure circulation is adequate for
                transit and general purpose vehicles. Examples of potential restrictions include right-
                in/right-out only or right-in/right-out/left-in only access.
                NE 38th Place Main Access: Given the restricted access along 108th Avenue NE,
                the majority of the traffic would use this driveway. The site should be configured to
                allow for approximately 100-feet of storage on the outbound approach and to direct
                users to this location.
               Enhanced Traffic Control at 108th Avenue NE/NE 38th Place Intersection: Traffic
                control improvements should be implemented to add capacity to NE 38th Place such
                as installation of a traffic signal or similar traffic control measures.

Lake Washington Boulevard/NE 38th Place. This intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS F
during the PM peak hour, with or without the proposed project. Based on the City of Kirkland
proportional share calculation worksheet, the TOD and park-and-ride proportional share at the
Lake Washington Boulevard/NE 38th Place intersection is approximately 1.70 percent. Based on
the City of Kirkland’s criteria, this would not be considered a significant impact in terms of the
SEPA thresholds.

Lake Washington Boulevard/Northup Way. This intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS E
during the weekday PM peak hour by 2030 with or without the project. The park-and-ride and TOD



                                                                                                                                    8
project would increase the total intersection volume at this location by less than one percent (see
Table 2). This intersection would continue operating at LOS E, which is within the acceptable LOS
D/E range typically used by the City of Bellevue.

108th Avenue NE/Northup Way. This intersection would operate at LOS E during the weekday
PM peak hour by 2030 with or without the project. The park-and-ride and TOD project would
increase the total intersection volume at this location by less than three percent (see Table 2). This
intersection would continue operating at LOS E, which is within the acceptable LOS D/E range
typically used by the City of Bellevue.

The suggested improvements have the potential to alter the circulation patterns internal to the site;
therefore, these improvements should be reassessed during the SEPA review at the time a
detailed plan is developed and a project moves forward. In general, the analysis shows that some
form of turn restrictions would be necessary at the 108th driveway and capacity improvements
would be needed at the 108th Avenue NE/NE 38th Place intersection to accommodate future
traffic levels associated with the project and potential shifts in traffic due to the turn restrictions on
108th Avenue NE.


Parking Guidelines
The purpose of this parking discussion is to provide information around the anticipated parking
demand in order to develop zoning regulations for the project. Currently no specific project has
been identified and as such no defined parking supply established. Parking demand for TOD
projects can be influenced by several key factors such as the mix of affordable housing and
provision of a senior housing component.

Data collected locally at four sites in the Redmond Urban Center, with market rate residential
                                                                      6
units, shows a parking demand range of 1.01 to 1.12 vehicles per unit . Provision of affordable
and/or senior housing would impact the parking demand significantly.

To understand the potential parking demand of the TOD component, this analysis assumed a
peak demand rate of 1.08 vehicles per unit for the residential component, which represents the
weighted average of the Redmond data. This does not take into consideration of factors discussed
previously regarding affordable and senior housing. Parking demand for the retail component was
                                                                                 th
calculated based on the average rate provided in the ITE Parking Generation, 4 Edition. It
anticipated the retail uses would be geared towards users of the park-and-ride facility as well as
the residential component; however, at this time only a 20 percent reduction in retail parking
demand has been assumed. In addition, TOD development in suburban areas is shown to the less
                                             th
than projected by ITE Parking Generation, 4 Edition. These assumptions should be further
refined when a development plan and potential uses are defined.

Based on the size of the TOD and the parking rates described above, Figure 1 shows the 24-hour
parking demand profiles for the retail and residential components of the TOD project. Time of day
distribution is also based on ITE.

Initial plans call for approximately one stall per unit or 250 stalls dedicated to the TOD portion (250
residential units/ 12,500 square-feet of retail) of the project, but this could change with the final
development plans. As shown in the figure, assuming a supply of 250 stalls, the peak parking
demands for the TOD component could exceed the dedicated parking between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00
a.m. by approximately 20 vehicles. This coincides with the low utilization periods of the park-and-
ride lot. As discussed above, the rate used to calculate residential parking demand is based on
market rate housing; therefore, this overflow from the TOD component would be less based on
adjustments to the peak demand to account for the affordable and/or senior housing.

Figure 2 provides an estimated parking demand curve for the park-and-ride based on data
collected at the South Kirkland Park-and-Ride during the peak periods (morning and evening) and
an assumed 100 percent occupancy during the peak periods. As discussed previously, the total
parking supply for the park-and-ride would be approximately 850 spaces with the project. The
graph shows that during the fringes of the peak period (i.e., prior to 7:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m.),
more than adequate capacity would exist to accommodate any overflow from the TOD
components, even assuming the upper end of the demand curve and only 200 stalls of dedicated
TOD parking provided.

Conclusions
A review of the potential local traffic impacts showed that relative to forecasted conditions without
the project, no significant change to off-site intersection operations would occur with development
of the TOD and park-and-ride expansion. For those intersections where forecasted operations are
projected to be LOS E/LOS F, mitigation would not likely be triggered based on current City of
Kirkland and City of Bellevue standards.
Improvements are recommended at the 108th Avenue NE/NE 38 Place intersection and the 108th
Avenue NE site access. These improvements include a combination of providing additional
capacity such as signalization at the 108th Avenue NE/NE 38th Place intersection and
implementation of turn restrictions at the 108th Avenue NE access. Several options exist for
capacity improvements and turn restrictions, and it is recommended that this be revisited when a
defined site plan is available such that any changes to the on-site circulation patterns can be
considered in the final recommendation. The effect of these recommendations would be to reduce
potential congestion along 108th Avenue NE near the access as well as a shift in traffic to NE 38th
Place, and accommodating increased side street demand by improving the 108th Avenue NE/
NE 38th Place intersection.
An analysis of the parking demand was conducted for the TOD component and park-and-ride. Due
to the nature of the TOD projects, it is desirable to have shared parking between the uses. Any
overflow from the TOD would be accommodated in the vacant stalls in the park-and-ride lot that
exist during non-peak times. The analysis showed that even with an average peak parking
demand of 1.08 vehicles per unit for the residential uses, a peak demand for shared parking would
not exceed 20 spaces. This can easily be met by the available parking at the park-and-ride lot.
When defining the required parking supply for the project, we recommend a baseline assumption
of 1.08 stalls per unit, consistent with the Redmond data, with provisions to adjust the required
parking supply to account for reductions due to senior and affordable housing components, as well
as the ability to share parking with the park-and-ride facility. If overflow from the TOD is
anticipated, the current utilization of the Park-and-Ride facility should be observed and the ability
for shared parking confirmed.

1. Trip generation rate based on ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition regression equation for apartment land use #220, average trip rate for shopping center (retail) land use #820, and traffic counts
conducted at the South Kirkland park-and-ride on December 15, 2010 for the park-and-ride use.
                                                                   nd
2. Internal trips calculated using ITE Trip Generation Handbook , 2  Edition assuming internal trips only between apartment and retail and retail and park‐and‐ride. The ITE office data was used 
for the park‐and‐ride internal trip rates. 

3. Based the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 128 (2008), New Transit Cooperative Research Program Research Confirms Transit-Oriented Developments Produce Fewer
Auto Trips , ITE Journal, (June 2009), and National Household Travel Survey (2009), a 40 percent reduction was taken to account for residents using transit rather than driving personal vehicles.
4. The pass-by rate 34 percent based on ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition for shopping center land use.
5. Fifty percent of the peak direction trips for the park-and-ride are assumed to be diverted.

SECTION 1

Introduction
LNG Development Company, LLC (doing business as Oregon LNG) proposes to own, construct, and operate a
liquefied natural gas (LNG) bidirectional terminal (Terminal) consisting of marine facilities, LNG storage tanks, LNG
vaporization facilities, natural gas liquefaction facilities, and associated support facilities, to be located in
Warrenton, Oregon. The Terminal will have a base load liquefaction capacity of 9.6 million metric ton per year,
which requires approximately 1.25 billion standard cubic feet per day of pretreated natural gas, and a base load
regasification capacity of 0.5 billion standard cubic feet per day.
Natural gas will be transported to and from the Terminal via an approximately 86.8-mile-long, 36-inch-outside-
diameter bidirectional pipeline (Pipeline) that is being developed by Oregon Pipeline Company, LLC (Oregon
Pipeline; together with LNG Development Company, LLC, Oregon LNG). 1 The Pipeline will interconnect with the
interstate transmission system of Northwest Pipeline GP (Northwest), a subsidiary of the Williams Companies, at
the Northwest Pipeline Interconnect (NPI) near Woodland, Washington. 2 The Pipeline will be routed through
Clatsop, Tillamook, and Columbia counties in Oregon and Cowlitz County in Washington. An electrically driven gas
compressor station (Compressor Station) will be constructed at milepost (MP) 80.8 of the Pipeline. The Terminal,
Pipeline, and Compressor Station are collectively referred to as the Bidirectional Project or Project.
A complete description of the Project can be found in Resource Report 1—General Project Description.
This traffic impact study summarizes the existing conditions and associated impacts of traffic anticipated from
future development of the LNG Project. This study analyzes impacts during construction of the Terminal and
Pipeline, as well as impacts to traffic at the completion of the Terminal.
The East Bank Skipanon Peninsula (ESP) is located north of Harbor Street (also known as Warrenton-Astoria
Highway 105) in the city of Warrenton, Clatsop County, Oregon. Primary access to the area is provided by United
States (US) Highway 101 (US 101). The Youngs Bay Bridge connects the city of Warrenton to the city of Astoria and
US Highway 30 (US 30) along US 101 to the northeast. To the south, US 101 provides access to the communities of
Seaside and Gearhart and the Portland area via US Highway 26 (US 26). Access from the west and additional
access from the south are provided by Fort Stevens Highway 104. Figure 1 depicts the current transportation
network and study area vicinity, while Figure 2 shows the general extent of the Pipeline.
Proposed access to the Terminal will be provided via King Avenue. King Avenue is a public, platted roadway that
runs north on the peninsula from Harbor Street and bisects Port of Astoria property on either side. This roadway
is currently unpaved and will be improved as part of the Project.
This traffic impact study addresses the scope items provided by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT)
in Appendix A. Seven study intersections within the city of Warrenton are included in this analysis. Three of the
intersections are located on US 101. These intersections are signal-controlled and maintained by ODOT. The
remaining study intersections are located along Harbor Street and are stop-controlled. All but one of the study
intersections on Harbor Street also are located on a state highway (Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105). The
intersection of Harbor Street and Neptune Avenue is not on a state highway. It is on a local street owned and
maintained by the City of Warrenton. The study intersections are as follows:
•    Harbor Street (Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105) and Main Avenue (Fort Stevens Highway 104)
•    Harbor Street (Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105) and King Avenue
•    Harbor Street (Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105) and Marlin Avenue
•    Harbor Street and Neptune Avenue


1 The Terminal and Pipeline are proposed at the site, and along the route, of Oregon LNG’s proposed LNG import terminal and
proposed pipeline that currently are pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Docket Numbers CP09-6-
000 and CP09-7-000, as amended in Docket Number PF12-18-000.
2 A separate application will be filed by Northwest for the Washington Expansion Project, a capacity expansion to Northwest’s
existing natural gas transmission facilities along the Interstate 5 corridor in the state of Washington.

SECTION 2

Existing Conditions
This section describes the existing transportation conditions (2012) in Warrenton within the study area.

2.1          Roadway Classification
Most roadways involved in this analysis are two-lane paved streets. US 101 provides access from the northeast
and southwest. US 101 is designated as a State National Highway System (NHS) highway in the 1999 Oregon
Highway Plan (OHP). This roadway, which is functionally classified as an arterial in the City of Warrenton
Transportation System Plan (TSP) of February 2004, includes bicycle facilities in both directions of travel. The main
function of US 101 is to provide mobility; therefore, access to this roadway is limited and speed limits are usually
greater than or equal to 45 miles per hour (mph). Between Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue, US 101 has a posted
speed limit of 45 mph. Fort Stevens Highway 104 (known locally as Main Avenue in the vicinity of Harbor Street)
and Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 (portions of Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue) are designated by the OHP as
district highways. They are categorized as collector facilities in the Warrenton TSP. Collector streets provide
connections between local roads and arterials, usually have more access locations, and operate at moderate
speeds. Harbor Street (between Marlin Avenue and US 101) is classified as a collector roadway in the Warrenton
TSP.
King Avenue between Harbor Street and the proposed site access road is unpaved. It is functionally classified as a
local roadway in the Warrenton TSP because of its low volume and limited access to collector roadways.

2.2          Study Intersection Volumes
Peak-hour turning movement volumes at the study intersections were collected on August 26 and 27, 2009. A
continuous 16-hour count was taken at the intersection of Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue (from 6:00 a.m. to
10:00 p.m.), while 3-hour PM peak-period (from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.) counts were taken at the remaining
locations. Volumes were collected in 15-minute intervals.
The peak hour of the 16-hour count at Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue was between 2:45 p.m. and 3:45 p.m.
This was conservatively assumed as the system peak hour for the entire study area. Because this peak occurred
earlier than the count period of the remaining study intersections, the peak-hour volumes at those intersections
were factored up to reflect 2:45 p.m. equivalent volumes. The raw count data and the process and calculations to
develop 2:45 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. afternoon system peak-hour study volumes are provided in Appendix B. Peak-hour
factor calculations by approach and heavy vehicle percentage calculations by movement were developed from the
p.m. peak-period turning movement counts. These calculations are provided in Appendix B.
The a.m. peak-period entering volumes at the Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue intersection were observed to be
roughly half that of the p.m. peak-period volumes and the afternoon (2:45 pm to 3:45 pm) system peak-hour
volumes. Between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., approximately 600 vehicles (on average) entered the intersection of
Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue, while approximately 1,175 vehicles entered between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
As a result of these lower peak-period volumes, the effect of the Project on a.m. commuter traffic will likely be
less than that of afternoon or p.m. peak commuter traffic. Therefore, it was determined that potential impacts
would be conservatively captured in an afternoon peak-hour analysis.
The afternoon system peak-hour counts were expanded to 2012 “existing” volumes by applying an average
growth rate to the raw counts taken in 2009. Although the raw counts were taken in 2009, the assumed “existing”
year of analysis is 2012. Based on historical average annual daily traffic volumes gathered from ODOT’s
Transportation Volume Tables between 2006 and 2011 (ODOT, 2012a), traffic has generally decreased on
Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 by an average of approximately 5 percent annually. Between the year of the
count data (2009) and 2011, traffic volumes decreased by over 12 percent. On US 101, within the study area,
traffic volumes increased slightly by 1.4 percent per year from 2006 through 2011, but between 2009 and 2011,
traffic in general has decreased by approximately 2.3 percent.

TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY, OREGON LNG BIDIRECTIONAL PROJECT, WARRENTON, OREGON


Average annual traffic within the study area has shown a general trend of contraction since 2009, based on the
most recent volumes available from ODOT. Although these volumes show decreases, the count data taken in 2009
were multiplied by a conservatively positive rate of 0.5 percent per year to estimate existing year 2012 analysis
volumes. This growth rate was assumed to account for modest potential growth. Short-term growth rates are
shown in Appendix C.
These 2012 existing-year volumes were seasonally adjusted to represent the 30th highest-hour design volumes
based on the seasonal trend methodology in ODOT’s Analysis Procedures Manual (ODOT, 2006). The seasonal
trend method was used because there were no permanent automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) onsite within the
city of Warrenton, and there were no reasonably characteristic ATR stations in the 2012 ATR Characteristic Table
(ODOT, 2012b). The seasonal adjustment factor was calculated to be 1.08. See Appendix C for existing year
growth rate calculations and seasonal adjustment factor development.
In urban areas, 30th highest-hour design volumes typically were analyzed because they were representative of
weekday peak-hour conditions. In coastal or seasonally affected areas, such as the study area, the 30th highest-
hour design volumes generally represented a tourist-driven weekend peak condition, rather than a weekday
commuter pattern. Because this analysis examines the 30th highest-hour design volumes, it can be assumed that
a typical weekday peak hour would experience lower volumes.
The derived 30th highest-hour design volumes were then balanced along Harbor Street (excluding Main Avenue)
and US 101 between adjacent intersections. The existing balanced turning movement volumes and intersection
lane channelization are presented in Figure 3.
The 1999 OHP (amended in December 2011) designates mobility standards expressed as v/c ratios based on
facility classification, area type, and speed zones for roadways intersecting state highways. The study intersections
are within the City of Warrenton Urban Growth Boundary. The OHP designates US 101 within Warrenton as a
statewide (NHS) nonfreight route. It is also categorized as outside the jurisdiction of a metropolitan planning
organization (non-MPO), with a speed limit of 45 mph. Therefore, according to Table 6 of the OHP, the mobility
standard threshold for intersections on US 101 is 0.80. The OHP designated both Fort Stevens Highway 104 (also
known as Main Avenue in downtown Warrenton) and Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 (which includes portions of
Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue) as district highways. These highways are considered non-MPO, outside of
special transportation areas (STAs), with posted speeds of 35 mph or less. Therefore, the OHP mobility standard
threshold for intersections on these district highways is 0.90. Harbor Street between Marlin Avenue and US 101 is
a local roadway and includes one nonstate highway study intersection (Harbor Street and Neptune Avenue) that
has been analyzed using the statewide standard for local interest roadways. Mobility standard thresholds by
facility type for study intersections are listed in Table 1.

This safety analysis provides an assessment of vehicular crash 3 history in the study area between 2007 and 2011.
Crash history statistics, which were provided by the ODOT Crash Analysis Unit for this time period, are the most
recent 5 years available at the time of this study. These data were analyzed to identify crash patterns that could
be a result of existing geometric or operational deficiencies along the state highways within the study area.
Table 2 summarizes the year 2011 crash rates and the 5-year average crash rates (2007 to 2011) for US 101 and
Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 within the limits of the study area. Statewide averages were taken from the 2011
State Highway Crash Rate Table II published by the ODOT Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit (ODOT, 2011).
Statewide crash rates vary by the classification of the facility.

a   Crashes per million vehicle miles (MVM).

In 2011, 16 crashes occurred on the 2.16-mile segment of US 101 that extends from just north of the Harbor
Street intersection to the south city limit of Warrenton. With a reported average daily traffic (ADT) volume of
12,680 vehicles in 2011 within the noted mileposts, the crash rate is approximately 1.60 crashes per million
vehicle miles of travel (MVM). This rate is higher than the 2011 statewide average rate of 0.72 for rural principal
arterials.
Between 2007 and 2011, 81 crashes occurred on the same stretch of US 101, resulting in a 5-year average rate of
1.62 crashes per MVM. More than half of these crashes involved rear-end collisions.
On Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105, three crashes occurred in 2011 between Main Street and Marlin Avenue,
resulting in an average crash rate of 0.98 crashes per MVM. Between Harbor Street and SE 12th Place, 3 crashes
occurred on the highway, resulting in an average crash rate of 2.76 crashes per MVM. The crash rate on the north-
south portion of this highway is much higher than the 2011 statewide average rate of 1.22 for rural major
collectors.
Within the past 5 years, 38 crashes occurred on Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 between Main Street and SE
12th Place. Approximately 55 percent of these crashes involved rear-end collisions or collisions between vehicles
turning.
Intersection safety analyses for the study intersections were also conducted. Table 3 provides a summary of the
crashes recorded by intersection location.

PDO - property damage only
a   Crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV).


Intersection influence extends to and includes a 0.05-mile linear distance on either side of an intersection
centerline. The intersection of US 101 and Marlin Avenue experienced the highest number of crashes, with 15
crashes occurring between 2007 and 2011. The intersection of US 101 and Harbor Street experienced the next
highest number of crashes, with 13 crashes in the 5-year crash history. The type of crash that occurred most often
at study intersections involved a vehicle rear-ending another vehicle (31 in 5 years), followed by crashes that
involved turning movements (8 in 5 years).
The majority of crashes (27 of the 46 total) within the 5-year history resulted in personal injuries, while the
remaining 19 crashes resulted in property damage only. No fatality accidents were reported at any of the study
intersections within the 5 year-period.
Intersection crash rates are reported in crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV). Each of the study
intersections on US 101 had an average annual crash rate greater than 1.0, which could indicate an existing safety
concern or issue. The intersection of US 101 and Marlin Avenue had an average annual crash rate of 1.74 crashes
per MEV. Detailed crash analysis statistics and are presented in Appendix D.

2.4            Operational Analysis
Intersection operations were analyzed using SYNCHRO software version 7. This software tool, based on the
methodology adopted in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000) (Transportation Research Board, 2005),
analyzes stop-controlled intersections as well as intersections controlled by signals. The model computes the v/c
ratios necessary to determine whether the intersection meets the applicable mobility standards from the OHP
(through the planning horizon) presented in Table 1.
Traffic operations can generally be described by v/c ratios. This measurement quantifies the relative vehicle
demand versus the capacity of a facility. A v/c ratio of 1.0 indicates the vehicle demand is equal to the capacity of
the facility, and correlates to LOS F conditions. Level of service also describes operating conditions on a roadway
based on a variety of measures, such as delay, speed, and density. There are six LOS classifications, each given a
letter designation from A to F. The classifications are defined in the HCM 2000. LOS A generally represents ideal
operating conditions with little to no delay and where movements are not influenced by other vehicles on the
roadway. LOS F represents poor operating conditions, including high delays and extreme congestion.

                                                                        TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY, OREGON LNG BIDIRECTIONAL PROJECT, WARRENTON, OREGON


The existing operations of each of the study intersections were analyzed with balanced 30th highest-hour
volumes. The v/c ratios, LOS, and delay times were reported for each location.
At signal-controlled intersections, the v/c ratio, LOS, and delay reported considered driver perceptions and were
based on overall operations. Existing signal phasing and timing information was collected from ODOT and is
included in Appendix E. At stop-controlled intersections, the v/c ratio was reported for the worst approach and
movement direction, while the LOS and delay were reported for the worst minor movement only. Table 4
summarizes the existing operational results, with failing intersections indicated in bold type. Signalized study
intersections that resulted in overall v/c ratios that were worse than the OHP mobility standard were considered
failing. Stop-controlled intersections were considered failing if the worst-performing stop-controlled approach
was worse than the OHP-designated mobility standard. Existing conditions SYNCHRO model output reports are
provided in Appendix E.
The results of the existing operational analyses show that two of the three signal-controlled study intersections
along US 101 exceed the OHP v/c ratio mobility standard of 0.80. This is mainly a result of high afternoon volumes
on US 101 as vehicles travel to and from the coast.
Additionally, two of the four stop-controlled intersections along Harbor Street (at Marlin Avenue and at Neptune
Avenue) operate at worse levels than their OHP v/c mobility standard because of high minor street volumes and
few gaps in traffic on the major street to allow turn movements. This means that any additional traffic added to
Harbor Street at Marlin Avenue will cause the intersection to worsen, and side street delays will increase. The
intersection of Harbor Street and King Avenue operates well under its mobility threshold with an acceptable v/c
ratio of 0.04. However, this is mainly a result of the undeveloped nature of the existing land use served by King
Avenue and extremely low volumes northbound and southbound on this street. With development on the ESP,
King Avenue will be more heavily traveled. The following sections describe trips generated by this potential
development, including the construction of the Terminal on the ESP.

SECTION 3

Peak Construction Year (2016) Conditions
An analysis for the assumed year of peak construction is included in this study to evaluate traffic impacts resulting
from the transport of materials, workers, and supplies to and from the Terminal site and to and from the Pipeline
during construction. Construction is anticipated to last almost 5 years, commencing with site work preparation.
Construction of the Terminal and Pipeline is expected to begin in 2014. Based on the construction schedule of the
tasks required for the Terminal (such as LNG tanks and marine facilities), the conservative peak construction year
for the Project would be 2016. Truck volumes and personnel trips for the Terminal and Pipeline were developed
using Project-specific estimates of manpower, materials, and equipment necessary to construct the facilities.
These estimates were then added to background traffic volumes for the year 2016.

3.1            Background Traffic Growth
3.1.1          Terminal
Figure 4 depicts traffic volumes as a result of background growth that could be expected to occur between the
existing year conditions (2012) and the peak year of construction (2016) in the Warrenton study area. Average
annual traffic within the study area has shown a general decreasing trend since 2009. Similar to existing traffic
volume development (see Section 2), a conservatively positive rate of 0.5 percent per year was used to estimate
construction year (2016) background volumes, as discussed in Section 2. Short-term growth rates are shown in
Appendix F.
In the construction year background traffic scenario, the roadway network near the Terminal resembles the
existing condition, with no changes to lane geometry. Four study intersections are expected to fail under future
2016 background conditions. Table 5 summarizes the traffic conditions with background growth in 2016.
Background traffic volumes, LOS values, and v/c ratios are presented on Figure 4.

3.1.2        Pipeline
The Pipeline will be constructed in four segments called “spreads.” These spreads will be constructed
simultaneously. Each spread will have a staging area, or pipe yards, where large construction materials will be
delivered via rail line. Trucks on surface streets will then move the materials and equipment from the pipe yard to
the final Pipeline location.
Spread 1 includes the Pipeline from its beginning at MP 0.0 (at the Terminal site on the ESP) to the Nehalem River
at approximately MP 33.0 near the town of Elsie, Oregon. The primary pipe yard for this spread would be located
at Tongue Point in the City of Astoria. From the pipe yard, trucks carrying construction loads would most likely
travel west along US 30 (also known as Marine Drive) from Tongue Point to either OR 202 southbound or continue
across the Youngs Bay Bridge on US 101. From US 101 southbound, trucks could continue south along the Oregon
coast and then east on US 26 towards Pipeline access roads. From OR 202, trucks would use multiple county or
local access construction roads to reach the Pipeline alignment.
Spread 2 extends from the Nehalem River for approximately 14.5 miles to the Clatsop-Columbia county line.
Construction materials for this spread could be delivered via rail to the town of Buxton, Oregon, along OR 47 just
north of US 26, and could be stored at a yard near the junction of Timber Road and US 26. From this storage yard,
construction vehicles could take US 26 or OR 47 to Pipeline access roads.
Spread 3 of the Pipeline extends for approximately 34.5 miles from roughly MP 47.5 to the Columbia River.
Pipeline materials for this spread would be delivered by rail to Buxton or a pipe yard on the east side of US 30
north of Columbia City, Oregon. From the pipe yard, vehicles and trucks carrying construction loads would most
likely travel north to local Pipeline access roads or south along US 30 to US 26 westbound. From US 26
westbound, Pipeline transport vehicles would use OR 47 northbound and various local or private access roads to
reach Pipeline construction locations.
Spread 4 is located entirely within Washington. It will connect to Spread 3 at the Columbia River and extend for
approximately 4.8 miles eastward to existing interconnection infrastructure in Woodland, Washington. Pipeline
materials for this spread will be delivered by rail to a pipe yard on the west side of Interstate 5 south of Kalama,
Washington. From the pipe yard, vehicles and trucks carrying construction loads will travel south on I-5 to Dike
Access Road (Exit 22). From Dike Access Road, Pipeline transport vehicles will use various local or private roads to
the east and west of I-5 to access Pipeline construction locations.
ADT volumes were developed for the peak year of construction (2016) background conditions by applying an
average growth rate to the most recent traffic data available on the Pipeline transport routes. Based on historical
average annual daily traffic volumes gathered from ODOT’s Transportation Volume Tables (ODOT, 2012) and
Washington State Department of Transportation Annual Traffic Reports for the years 2006 through 2011 (WSDOT,
2012), traffic has generally decreased on most of the Pipeline transport routes.
Although these volumes show contraction, current ADT volumes on potential highways were multiplied by a
conservatively positive rate of 0.5 percent per year to achieve year 2016 background volumes. Historical volumes
on US 26 grew at approximately 4.7 percent per year since 2006; therefore, this growth rate was used to achieve
construction year 2016 background traffic volumes. Short-term growth rates for Pipeline transport routes are
shown in Appendix F.

3.2          Trip Generation
Trips generated by construction of the Terminal and Pipeline were estimated from Project quantities and are
presented in Table 6. Typical trip generation methodologies (such as using land use codes to calculate trip
generation rates from the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual) would not reasonably
represent the actual trips generated by this unique facility.

a Trucks   or personnel required during the peak month of construction.
b Estimates   include construction vehicles for Terminal facilities only.

Construction trips were conservatively estimated for the peak month of construction activity. This assumes that
the peak of construction for various activities throughout the Project site would occur simultaneously during the
same month, and in some situations on the same peak day. Because the construction period for the Project could
span up to 5 years, construction activities would likely be spread out over this time, and the actual construction
volumes during a given peak hour or peak day would be lower.
During the peak of construction of the Oregon LNG Terminal, increased traffic is anticipated near the peninsula
and may include trucks with oversized loads, heavy-duty and light-duty delivery trucks, and construction workers.
Approximately 279 cars and small or light-duty delivery vehicle trips could be generated during the afternoon
peak hour. The majority of these vehicles will be personnel entering or exiting the site at the beginning or end of a
work shift. Up to 96 large or heavy vehicle trips could be generated by Terminal construction during the afternoon
peak hour.
Approximately 1,066 cars or small vehicles could be generated on a peak day of the peak month of construction
for the Pipeline, while 610 heavy vehicles or large trucks could be expected on a peak day during the peak month
of Pipeline construction. Construction of the Pipeline will occur simultaneously with construction of the Terminal.
ES030613113935PDX                                                                                                                                 3-3
TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY, OREGON LNG BIDIRECTIONAL PROJECT, WARRENTON, OREGON


The majority of the Pipeline will not be located in the same area as the Terminal; therefore, only a portion of the
vehicles associated with construction of the Pipeline will overlap with construction trips destined for the Terminal.
In addition, it is unlikely that the total estimated number of construction staff for any Pipeline segment would be
required daily at each site. Specialized staff and labor would be more likely to visit construction locations as
necessary during the Pipeline construction process. Therefore, the actual daily volume of cars or small vehicles
associated with Pipeline construction would be lower than estimated.

3.3          Trip Distribution
Peak-hour trips generated during Terminal construction are anticipated to arrive at the Project site via state
highways. King Avenue will provide the main access route from Harbor Street to the Project site. Figure 5 depicts
the percentage distribution of Terminal-generated trips during construction. The distribution of generated trips is
based on expected sources of construction materials and personnel. Approximately 40 percent of vehicles will be
generated in Astoria, while 45 percent will likely arrive and depart via US 101 from the south. Approximately
10 percent of construction vehicles will originate west of the site and use Fort Stevens Highway 104 to access the
Project, and 5 percent of vehicles will arrive and depart via Warrenton Astoria Highway 105 to the south.
In the afternoon peak hour, 70 percent of all construction-related cars and small delivery vehicles are assumed to
exit the Terminal site, while 30 percent are assumed to enter the site. These vehicle types are mainly associated
with day laborers and deliveries that operate on a typical day shift that will likely end in the afternoon. Heavy
delivery vehicles transporting machinery and large equipment will likely arrive and depart from the site
throughout the day. Because these vehicles will not be on a typical day shift schedule, it was assumed that
50 percent of heavy vehicle trips would enter the site and 50 percent would exit during the afternoon peak hour.
Based on the various tasks necessary to construct the Pipeline, it is likely that only a portion of construction-
related vehicles will access the same location on the same day or within the same peak hour. Sequenced
equipment delivery and assembly will likely occur at construction locations along the Pipeline that are different
than other construction activities such as Pipeline placement or welding. Therefore, only 80 percent of the daily
construction vehicles (approximately 520 vehicles for Spread 1, 170 vehicles for Spread 2, 520 vehicles for
Spread 3, and 130 vehicles for Spread 4) are assumed to affect traffic conditions by accessing a single location
along the Pipeline spreads on a peak day.
Construction traffic for Spread 1 would likely originate from the Tongue Point pipe yard in the City of Astoria. The
Tongue Point pipe yard could likely support the majority of all required personnel, materials and equipment for
Spread 1. Assuming construction traffic for Spread 1 originates at the Tongue Point pipe yard, approximately 200
vehicles could overlap with Terminal construction traffic during the peak hour. Figure 6 depicts the peak hour
distribution of Pipeline construction trips for Spread 1, while Figure 7 shows the combined peak hour construction
trips generated by the Terminal and Pipeline at the study intersections.
Vehicles associated with construction of the remainder of the Pipeline are anticipated to have little effect on
existing traffic conditions on Pipeline access roads. The distribution of trucks and personnel vehicles would occur
over long stretches of highway (as opposed to through highly congested intersections) and would occur
throughout the day (not simultaneous with peak hour traffic at study intersections).

3.4          Construction Analysis
To conservatively analyze traffic operations at the study intersections during the peak of construction, the
construction-generated trips related to the Terminal and Pipeline were added to background traffic volumes and
distributed through the transportation network. The total (background plus construction) year 2016 intersection
volumes associated with Terminal construction are shown on Figure 8. Table 7 summarizes the operational results
with construction trips. Bold type indicates failing intersection operations.

intersections).
b   LOS and delay are reported for worst approach (stop-controlled intersections) or for overall operations (signal-controlled intersections).
c   Err = Delay exceeds 600 seconds of delay per vehicle and cannot be reasonably calculated.

Four of the seven study intersections fail in the background conditions. The added construction trips will further
worsen operations but only temporarily. Five of seven study intersections are expected to fail during construction
of the Terminal with the existing lane channelization.
Three stop-controlled intersections will operate at LOS F and exceed their OHP v/c ratio mobility standards. Two
of these intersections were already failing in the background condition, but as a result of construction, the
intersection of Harbor Street and King Avenue will experience a high v/c ratio and high delay times. Because there
are few gaps in traffic on Harbor Street, the delay at the stop-controlled southbound movement increases
significantly. This intersection currently has little to no northbound or southbound traffic, but during construction
it will be the main access to the Project site, and the majority of construction-related traffic will need to make
turns at this location.
The operations at the signal-controlled intersections will also be affected by construction trips. Signal timing at
the three signal-controlled intersections on US 101 were optimized as part of the analysis. The average delay at
the intersection of Harbor Street and US 101 increases by approximately 18 seconds per vehicle compared to
2016 background conditions. Similarly, the intersection at US 101 and Marlin Avenue will experience an increase
of approximately 56 seconds of delay per vehicle. These vehicle delay increases are a result of additional
construction traffic accessing the Project site. The v/c ratio at the intersection of US 101 and Neptune Avenue
remains the same with or without construction traffic because no construction trips are expected to use this
intersection.
Vehicles associated with construction of the Pipeline are anticipated to have little effect on existing traffic
conditions on Pipeline access roads. The distribution of trucks and personnel vehicles will occur over long
stretches of highway (as opposed to through highly congested intersections) and will occur throughout the day
(not only during morning or afternoon peak hours). Most of the Pipeline transport routes are expected to operate
at v/c ratios within the OHP threshold of 0.85 (for US 30 and US 26) or 0.95 (for OR 47) under future 2016
background conditions. Through the city of Seaside, US 101 would likely experience congestion under 2016
background conditions without construction trips, based on forecast traffic volumes. Operations would likely
exceed the OHP threshold of 0.80 for US 101. With the addition of construction trips, US 101 would be affected
temporarily during the course of construction but could be mitigated (to background conditions) with

TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY, OREGON LNG BIDIRECTIONAL PROJECT, WARRENTON, OREGON


adjustments to transport route trip assignments and appropriate mitigation measures. Construction year
conditions model output reports are provided in Appendix G.

3.5          Construction Mitigation
During construction, traffic volumes on the existing roadway network will increase, and some adverse effects may
be experienced. Potential impacts could include reduced capacity, higher delay times, increased turning
movements at intersections, and slower-moving traffic.
To manage and alleviate these potential impacts, temporary mitigation measures will be developed as needed as
part of a traffic management plan and could include the following:
•     Establish temporary increases in lane capacity (by widening existing shoulders for bypass traffic).
•     Institute time-of-day restrictions for large, oversized construction vehicles.
•     Use flaggers, as necessary, to direct traffic when large equipment is exiting or entering public roads to
      minimize risk of accidents.
•     Provide advance warning and proper roadway signage along US 101, Highway 105, and US 30 to warn
      motorists of potential vehicles entering and exiting the roadway. Signage would include “Equipment on
      Road,” “Truck Access,” or “Road Crossings.”
•     Use pilot vehicles when slow or oversized wide loads are being hauled.
•     Institute mandatory or encouraged carpooling among construction personnel to reduce traffic volume to and
      from the Project site; limit numbers of parking spaces onsite during construction.
•     Place appropriate detour plans and warning signage in advance of any planned traffic disturbances.
•     Maintain one travel lane on all roadways at all times, if possible. If lane closures must occur, post adequate
      signage for potential detours or possible delays.
These mitigation measures will be temporary because the short-term impact from construction vehicles will not
be permanent. To maintain safety during construction, the developer could install a temporary traffic signal at the
intersection of Harbor Street and King Avenue. This temporary signal would provide protected movements to
large vehicles making turns out of the Project site onto eastbound Harbor Street. At Project completion, the
temporary signal could be removed or left in place, depending on discussion and coordination with ODOT.
Additional turn lanes at Harbor Street and King Avenue are also proposed. Although these additional turn lanes
would not mitigate v/c ratios to within mobility standard levels, they could alleviate anticipated impacts resulting
from construction. Large heavy vehicles are expected to access the site from the west and will likely cause some
delay as they slow down to make right turns into the site from Harbor Street. A separate right-turn lane on Harbor
Street to King Avenue will help facilitate deceleration of these large vehicles because they will be removed from
the mainline westbound traffic stream. A separate left-turn lane southbound on King Avenue will provide storage
for large vehicles waiting to enter Harbor Street without blocking southbound right turns.

SECTION 4

Opening Year (2019) Conditions
A year of opening analysis is included in this study to evaluate traffic impacts resulting from Terminal
construction. According to the construction schedule, the Project will be completed in 2019. Similar to effects
during construction, trucks and personnel vehicles required for operation of the Project when complete were
added to background growth to determine the effects of operating the facility.

4.1            Background Traffic Growth
To achieve opening-year 2019 traffic volumes, a growth rate of 0.50 percent per year was applied to the existing
volumes on US 101, Harbor Street, and the Warrenton-Astoria Highway 105 (portions of Marlin Avenue and
Harbor Street), also known as US 101 Business. This estimate is based on the short-term future growth calculated
from historical volumes. See Appendix F for future short-term background growth rate calculations. Table 8
summarizes the background traffic conditions in 2019. Figure 9 depicts the baseline turning movement volumes at
the study intersections in 2019, along with their anticipated LOS values and v/c ratios.

In the year 2019 background traffic scenario, the roadway network resembles the existing condition, with no
changes to lane geometry. To conservatively analyze background operations, the additional turn lanes at Harbor
Street and King Avenue assumed as construction mitigation are not included.
Four of the seven study intersections are expected to fail in the future 2019 background conditions. At the stop-
controlled approaches on Harbor Street (at Marlin Avenue and at Neptune Avenue), background traffic increases
cause higher delay times on the northbound approaches. With few gaps in traffic on Harbor Street, and no future
planned improvement projects at these locations, the delay for the stop-controlled movements would increase.

4.2            Trip Generation
Trips generated by the Project at completion will include personnel vehicles and occasional delivery trucks. Truck
volumes and personnel trips for the Terminal were developed using Project-specific estimates of manpower and

equipment required during operation. These truck and personnel trips were compared with similar LNG import
Terminal projects to assess validity.
At completion, the Pipeline will operate without personnel. Occasional maintenance may be required, but these
trips will be sporadic and will likely occur at various locations on the Pipeline; therefore, no personnel or truck
trips were assumed for the operation of the Pipeline.
The proposed Jordan Cove Energy Project in Coos Bay, Oregon, reported requiring one truck during the peak hour
of operation. A conservative estimate of two small trucks for the Oregon LNG Terminal was assumed for operation
because this facility is only slightly larger. These operational trucks will likely leave the Terminal site during the
afternoon peak hour.
Project-specific operations estimates include 121 staff workers employed by the facility at completion. Assuming a
typical three-shift operating schedule similar to the proposed Jordan Cove Energy Project, during a typical day,
50 percent of employees will work the day shift, 25 percent will work the swing shift, and 25 percent will work the
night shift. As a conservative estimate, 61 staff workers will work the day shift and will likely exit the facility during
the afternoon peak hour. Thirty workers will work the swing shift and will likely arrive at the Terminal site during
the afternoon peak hour.
During operation of the Oregon LNG Terminal, 93 trips will be added to the traffic network during the peak hour
(61 personnel vehicles and two trucks outbound, 30 vehicles inbound).

4.3          Trip Distribution
Peak-hour trips generated during Terminal operation are anticipated to arrive at the Project site similar to
construction traffic. Approximately 40 percent of vehicles will be generated in Astoria, while 45 percent will likely
arrive via US 101 from the south. Approximately 10 percent of operations vehicles will originate west of the site
and use Fort Stevens Highway 104 to access the Terminal. Five percent of operations vehicles will arrive via
Warrenton Astoria Highway 105 to the south. Figure 10 shows the trips generated by the Terminal at completion
(2019). Only operations trips related to the Terminal are shown because the Pipeline will not require daily
operational trips.

4.4          Operations Analysis
Traffic during operation of the facility (at the year of opening in 2019) will be minimal compared to background
conditions. Operational trips were added to the background traffic volumes for the year 2019, and the total
volumes were analyzed similar to those for construction effects. The total (background plus operations) year 2019
volumes are shown on Figure 11. Table 9 summarizes the operational results. Bold type indicates failing
intersection operations.
Mobility standard thresholds for future conditions are the same as the existing conditions because this is a
planning-level Project. Traffic at the completion of the Project is expected to be similar to 2019 baseline
conditions, but because most of the study intersections currently fail in the background conditions, added trips
resulting from operations may slightly worsen v/c ratios at completion of the Terminal Project.

The results of the analyses with operations trips show that two of the stop-controlled intersections on Harbor
Street (Marlin Avenue and Neptune Avenue) would operate at LOS F and would exceed their respective OHP v/c
ratio mobility standards on the worst minor approach. Although the intersection of Harbor Street and King
Avenue operates at LOS F, the southbound stop-controlled approach will operate within its OHP-designated
mobility standard v/c ratio of 0.90 and will not be considered failing. The intersections at Marlin Avenue and at
Neptune Avenue are expected to fail in 2019 whether or not the Project is constructed.
The intersection of Harbor Street and King Street would operate at a v/c ratio of 0.72, which is within its OHP
mobility standard. Due to Project operations traffic, vehicles exiting the Project site on the southbound approach
are expected to experience long delays as they wait for gaps in traffic on Harbor Street. The majority of exiting
traffic will turn left out of King Street destined to US 101.
Signal timing at the three signal-controlled intersections on US 101 were optimized as part of the year of opening
baseline analysis. The average delay at the intersection of Harbor Street and US 101 increases by less than
3 seconds per vehicle when operational vehicles are added to the network (compared to 2019 background
results). US 101 at Neptune Avenue will see virtually no impact from Terminal operations because no operations-
related vehicles are expected to pass through this intersection. At US 101 at Marlin Avenue, the average delay will
increase by approximately 10 seconds per vehicle as a result of the addition of operations traffic.
Although four intersections exceed their OHP mobility standard at the year of opening, the increase is not caused
by traffic generated by the LNG facility. Intersections could be expected to fail as a result of background traffic
levels alone in 2019. At the year of opening, additional traffic generated by trucks and personnel required to work
at the facility is not expected to significantly affect traffic conditions at the study intersections.
Year of opening (2019) SYNCHRO model output reports for the background and total traffic conditions at study
intersections are provided in Appendix H.
Daily vehicle trips are not expected for operation of the Pipeline. When the Pipeline is completed, infrequent
inspection or monitoring would be required, but trips associated with these activities would not occur daily;
therefore, no impacts to traffic operations will occur with Pipeline operation.

Future Horizon Year (2034) Conditions
The future-year analysis evaluated traffic impacts resulting from operation of the Terminal at a 15-year horizon.
Operational traffic volumes generated by the Terminal in 2034 are expected to be the same as traffic generated at
the year of opening.

5.1          Background Traffic Growth
Background traffic volumes in 2034 were developed using a growth rate of 0.83 percent per year applied to the
existing condition volumes at each of the study intersections. This growth rate is based on the long-term future
growth calculated from the 2031 ODOT Future Volume Table values (ODOT, 2012c). Appendix F contains future
background growth-rate calculations. Table 10 shows the 2034 background traffic conditions. Figure 12 depicts
the future (2034) turning movement volumes along with their anticipated LOS values and v/c ratios.

Although it is reasonable to assume improvements to the study area network would occur by the year 2034, the
horizon-year analysis was conducted assuming the same roadway network as the existing condition. The
additional turn lanes at Harbor Street and King Avenue assumed as construction mitigation are not included.
In the horizon-year background traffic scenario, six of the seven study intersections are expected to exceed their
respective v/c thresholds. Four intersections were expected to fail in 2019 as a result of background growth alone
(except Harbor Street at Main Street and US 101 at Neptune Avenue). With an additional 15 years of background
growth, the operations at these intersections could be expected to worsen. Delays at the stop-controlled
approaches on Marlin Avenue and on Neptune Avenue will increase because vehicles will find fewer gaps in traffic
on eastbound and westbound Harbor Street.

5.2          Trip Generation and Distribution
Trips generated by the Terminal Project during the horizon year will be similar to the trips generated at Project
completion. The Pipeline at the horizon year will likely require occasional maintenance but will not generate daily
trips.

TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY, OREGON LNG BIDIRECTIONAL PROJECT, WARRENTON, OREGON


The same number of personnel will be required to operate the Terminal facility (121 total personnel) in three
separate shifts. Day shift personnel (61 staff) will leave the Terminal site at the end of the day shift, while 30 staff
workers will enter the site to begin the swing shift. These shift changes will likely occur during the afternoon peak
hour. Two heavy-duty maintenance trucks could be expected to leave the site at the end of the day shift as well.
In the horizon year, 93 trips will be added to the traffic network. Figure 10 depicts operations-related trip
distribution.

5.3            Operations Analysis
Traffic operations with or without the Terminal will be similar between the background and developed scenarios.
Operational trips were added to the background traffic volumes for the year 2034, and the total volumes were
analyzed in SYNCHRO. The total network volumes (background plus operations trips) for the horizon year (2034)
are shown on Figure 13. Table 11 summarizes the operational results.
The results of the total development scenario are similar to the background traffic scenario in that the same study
intersections fail to meet the OHP v/c ratio mobility standards. The intersection of Harbor Street and King Avenue,
compared to the background traffic scenario, will worsen with operational trips. The average southbound delay at
the intersection of Harbor Street and King Avenue will likely increase by over 140 seconds per vehicle as they wait
for gaps in traffic on Harbor Street. The v/c ratio at this intersection increases from 0.05 in the background
condition to 1.01 and will therefore exceed its mobility standard of 0.90.
With operational trips added to the network, the v/c ratio at Harbor Street and Marlin Avenue will increase from
1.79 under background conditions to 2.00 with operations trips. This intersection is expected to be over capacity
from the existing year, and the additional trips generated by the Terminal will cause an average increase in delay
of approximately 90 seconds per vehicle compared to background conditions.
Horizon year (2034) SYNCHRO model output reports for the background and total traffic conditions are provided
in Appendix I.

SECTION 6

Proposed Mitigation
As shown in Tables 9 and 11, four of the seven study intersections are expected to perform poorly in the year of
opening, and all intersections are expected to fail in the horizon year with the Terminal. These deficiencies are
mainly a result of high projected volumes on Harbor Street combined with high delay times for vehicles trying to
enter it from stop-controlled approaches. Although these delays will likely occur in the future even without the
Terminal Project development, mitigation measures at select intersections could improve conditions so that
traffic operations with the Terminal are not worse than background traffic-only conditions. These potential
mitigation measures could be implemented by Oregon LNG, ODOT, or the local jurisdictions. Signalized locations
on US 101 are owned and maintained by the state; therefore, any proposed mitigation to those locations will
need to be discussed with and approved by ODOT prior to implementation. ODOT would continue to operate and
maintain the mitigated signals along US 101.

6.1          Harbor Street at King Avenue
Mitigation measures at the intersection of Harbor Street at King Avenue include a separate westbound right-turn
lane and a separate southbound right-turn lane. Currently, all approaches include shared through- and turn-
movements in a single lane. By separating the westbound right-turn movement on Harbor Street, vehicles
entering the Terminal will be able to decelerate without affecting through traffic. The southbound dedicated turn
lane will facilitate right-turning vehicles and will allow them to bypass the southbound queue that will be caused
by vehicles waiting to turn left on eastbound Harbor Street.
By including these turn-lane measures, the southbound approach is expected to operate at a v/c ratio of 0.68 in
the year of opening. In the future horizon year, with mitigation, this intersection could operate at a v/c ratio of
0.96. Operations will improve with mitigation, but will not meet the future v/c ratio threshold of 0.90 due to the
high delays expected for Terminal vehicles exiting the site in the peak hour.
A traffic signal was considered as mitigation at this intersection but was not warranted based on future forecasted
volumes. A permanent traffic signal would not be appropriate mitigation because it would also be likely to cause
adverse effects for east- and westbound through traffic on Harbor Street by introducing delay to an uncontrolled
movement.

6.2          Harbor Street at Marlin Avenue
At the intersection of Harbor Street at Marlin Avenue, proposed mitigation includes extending the northbound
right-turn lane to provide at least 200 feet of storage. Currently, vehicles turning left from Marlin Avenue to
westbound Harbor Street queue as they wait for an acceptable gap in traffic. This queue occasionally blocks
vehicles on Marlin Avenue waiting to turn right onto eastbound Harbor Street. The additional right-turn lane
storage will improve operations by providing more opportunities to bypass the back of the queue, and allow more
right-turning vehicles to make that movement.
A two-way left-turn lane or westbound receiving lane could be constructed on Harbor Street for northbound left-
turning traffic from Marlin Avenue. This receiving lane will provide refuge for turning vehicles after they find a gap
in eastbound traffic. It will allow turning vehicles to find a gap in traffic in one direction at a time, instead of both
directions at once, and will increase the capacity of the northbound left-turning movement. This potential
mitigation measure would require widening on Harbor Street west of Marlin Avenue.
By extending the northbound right-turn lane on Marlin Avenue and providing a receiving lane on Harbor Street in
the year of opening, the northbound approach is expected to improve to a v/c ratio of 0.68. Similarly, in the future
horizon year, with mitigation, this intersection could operate at a v/c ratio of 0.79, which is better than the v/c
ratio threshold of 0.90.

TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY, OREGON LNG BIDIRECTIONAL PROJECT, WARRENTON, OREGON



6.3          Harbor Street at Neptune Avenue
To improve operations at the intersection of Harbor Street at Neptune Avenue, a receiving lane could be
constructed for northbound left-turning traffic from Neptune Avenue. This receiving lane would provide refuge
for turning vehicles and would allow them to find a gap in traffic in one direction at a time, instead of both
directions at once. This potential mitigation measure would require widening on Harbor Street between Marlin
Avenue and Neptune Avenue and would need to provide enough acceleration distance for vehicles to gain speed
to merge with westbound Harbor Street traffic.
By providing a refuge or receiving lane on Harbor Street, northbound left-turning vehicles from Neptune Avenue
will experience shorter delays. The v/c ratios will improve from 1.13 (with operations trips without mitigation) to
0.51 in the year of opening (with mitigation) and from 1.74 (operations trips without mitigation) to 0.68 (with
mitigation) in the horizon year.
A traffic signal was evaluated as mitigation at the intersection of Harbor Street and Neptune Avenue but, based
on future forecasted volumes, is not warranted. It is also likely to adversely affect adjacent intersections by
creating platoons of vehicles. These platoons on Harbor Street would actually cause an increase in delay times for
vehicles waiting to turn from Marlin Avenue.

6.4          US 101 at Marlin Avenue
Proposed mitigation at the intersection of US 101 and Marlin Avenue includes the addition of a southbound right-
turn lane. This dedicated turn lane will facilitate right-turning vehicles and allow them to bypass the southbound
through movement queue to make their movement. By adding a separate right-turn lane, more vehicles will be
able to move through the intersection more efficiently. The overall v/c ratios with mitigation will improve to 0.92
in the year of opening (compared to a v/c ratio of 1.16 with operations trips without mitigation), and to 1.02 in
the horizon year (compared to a v/c ratio of 1.26 without mitigation).

6.5          US 101 at Neptune Avenue
No mitigation is proposed at the intersection of US 101 at Neptune Avenue. This intersection is expected to meet
the operation threshold and operate at a v/c ratio of 0.80 in the year of opening, with or without the completed
Project in place.
In the horizon year, the intersection is expected to operate at a v/c of 0.89 under both the background condition
and the total condition. While it is not expected to meet the operational threshold, no adverse impacts are
expected at the intersection of US 101 and Neptune Avenue as a result of operation of the Terminal.

6.6          US 101 at Harbor Street
This intersection is expected to operate worse than its mobility standard threshold with or without the Project. In
the year of opening, Project-related operations trips cause the overall v/c ratio to increase from 0.94 (under
background conditions) to 0.95. Similarly, in the horizon year, operations trips increase the v/c ratio from 1.05 to
1.07.
To mitigate impacts from operational Project trips, future-year signal phasing could be modified and optimized
along US 101. The northbound left-turn phase could be updated to allow permissive turns in addition to the
protected left turns only. Optimizing the signals along US 101 with this phase will accommodate more vehicles
and increase throughput at each of the study intersections along US 101 within the city of Warrenton. This
optimization will allow the intersection to operate at v/c ratios that are not worse than the background traffic-
only condition.
This mitigation is reasonable given the minor change in v/c ratio between background and total traffic conditions.

Harbor Street, were examined but would not be appropriate to mitigate this situation. The surrounding area is
constrained by waterways and vegetation, and lane widening would be excessive.
Table 12 presents the operational results at selected intersections where reasonable mitigation measures were
applied. With mitigation, the operations at the study intersections will be similar to the background traffic-only
condition at all intersections except for Harbor Street and King Avenue. Year of opening (2019) and horizon-year
(2034) operational results with mitigation are presented in Figure 14, and SYNCHRO model output reports for the

6.7          Queuing Analysis
The reported v/c ratios and delay provide only one measure of effectiveness of intersection operations. Vehicle
queuing in the turn lanes indicates that the storage length is deficient at intersection approaches. Queue lengths
can affect overall intersection corridor operations by delaying and restricting upstream vehicle movements. This is
true for both signal-controlled and stop-controlled intersections. Long queues that develop in turn lanes can
result in spillback into the main roadway segment, which may prevent through traffic from proceeding to the
intersection. This also potentially causes blocking on side streets and private driveways, as well as hindering
access to adjacent properties. Traffic turning left onto a roadway at a stop-controlled intersection can also delay
right-turning vehicles while they wait for a safe gap in traffic.
To determine queuing, operations were analyzed using the SimTraffic simulation tool. Each scenario was run five
times in SimTraffic to obtain an average 95th percentile queue length, using guidelines from the ODOT
Transportation Planning Analysis Unit’s Analysis Procedures Manual (ODOT, 2006). The 95th percentile queue
length refers to the maximum queue that occurs during 95 percent of the peak hour of travel. The length of the
queue is less than this 95 percent of the time. The queue could be greater but only for 5 percent of the time.
Table 13 reports the worst lane group queue for each of the study intersections. Bold type indicates a queue
length that exceeds its storage distance. The percent of time that the storage length is blocked is noted in
parentheses. This blockage time could be caused by a turn-lane queue exceeding the turn-lane storage distance or
by a mainline through queue backing up beyond the storage distance. In both instances, a blockage is preventing
vehicles from entering the storage lane. Appendix K includes SimTraffic model output reports for the queue
scenarios presented in Table 13, as well as queue lengths for all lane groups at each intersection approach.

6.8          Harbor Street at Main Avenue
At the intersection of Harbor Street and Main Avenue, the storage capacity on the westbound left-turn lane is
exceeded in most scenarios. The westbound left-turn lane has an existing capacity of 75 feet, which is exceeded in
the existing scenario by at least 50 feet. As traffic volumes grow, the future year of opening and the horizon year
are also expected to produce queues that exceed the existing storage length by at least 50 feet (or approximately
two vehicles). Because this queue is an existing condition and vehicle spillback is not expected to block local
driveway access, no mitigation is recommended at this intersection.

6.9          Harbor Street at Neptune Avenue
At the intersection of Harbor Street and Neptune Avenue, the northbound left-turn lane has an existing capacity
of approximately 100 feet. In the existing condition, this storage is exceeded by up to 50 feet, or approximately
two vehicles. These vehicles are not accommodated by the turn lane and may spill back onto Neptune Avenue. In
the future scenarios, the 95th percentile queues remain similar but would be more likely to block the adjacent lane
of traffic as volumes grow.
As potential mitigation, this left-turn lane could be extended to approximately 300 feet without affecting private
property driveways along Neptune Avenue. Although the 95th percentile queue will still likely exceed the storage,
the percentage of time this spillback blocks mainline traffic on Neptune Avenue will decrease due to the
additional dedicated storage.

6.10 US 101 at Marlin Avenue
The northbound and southbound left-turn lanes currently provide approximately 150 feet (or six vehicles) of
storage in each direction. In the existing condition and most of the future scenarios, this capacity is exceeded and
is likely caused by permissive-only phasing. Mitigation at the intersection could include lengthening storage lanes,
but it is not recommended as part of this Project. Extending storage lanes would likely affect storage capacity at
adjacent intersections, and the queue spillbacks are an existing condition and will not be worsened by Project-
related operations trips.

6.11 US 101 at Neptune Avenue
The southbound left-turn storage lane from Neptune Avenue to eastbound US 101 is exceeded in all scenarios.
This lane provides approximately 100 feet of storage (seven vehicles) and may be difficult to lengthen without
significantly affecting access to the businesses along Neptune Avenue. No mitigation is proposed as part of this
Project.

6.12 US 101 at Harbor Street
The southbound right-turn lane storage is exceeded in all scenarios at the intersection of US 101 and Harbor
Street. The eastbound left-turn lane also experiences queues in all scenarios. These eastbound queues spill back
past Neptune Avenue (approximately 1,250 feet to the west of US 101) in the existing condition and the future
horizon year. This queue could block vehicles exiting Neptune Avenue and prohibit vehicles from entering the
eastbound right-turn lane on Harbor Street. Potential mitigation could include lane widening on Harbor Street and
on the receiving lanes of US 101 northbound to provide additional capacity for left-turning vehicles.
Mitigation at this location is not recommended as part of this Project because queues are an existing condition
and do not worsen as a result of Project trips. Lane widening or storage lane lengthening on US 101 are not
recommended because they would likely affect wetlands and vegetation on the southeast side of the roadway
and could affect the Youngs Bay Bridge structure.
The queuing analysis indicates that inadequate capacity at a number of intersections could affect overall traffic
operations in the future. Although this spillback may affect local access to minor streets, the majority of the
intersection approaches discussed in this subsection are not anticipated to be adversely affected as a result of
Project-related operations trips.

Conclusions
The purpose of this traffic impact study is to summarize the traffic-related effects of construction and operation of
the Terminal and Pipeline. To study the transportation effects of the potential development, vehicle truck and
personnel trips necessary during the peak of construction (2016) were estimated from trips generated by similar
LNG terminals. Operational vehicle trips for the year of opening (2019) and a 15-year horizon (2034) were also
estimated in the same manner.
The analysis was conducted for the 30th highest hour. In a coastal area such as Warrenton, this is very different
from a typical weekday peak (when Terminal workforce peaks would most likely occur). The 30th highest hour in a
coastal area may be more representative of a weekend day because of its seasonal nature. Therefore, because the
typical weekday peak in Warrenton may experience lower volumes, the results reported in this study may be
overstated.
As shown in Table 11, each of the study intersections is expected to perform worse than the OHP mobility
standard under the future developed scenario with the addition of LNG import Terminal operational trips.
However, with mitigation, these intersections (except for Harbor Street and King Avenue) could perform no worse
than the future background-traffic-only conditions without Project-related trips. The intersections on Harbor
Street at Marlin Avenue and at Neptune Avenue could be expected to operate better than background conditions
with the addition of a center two-way left-turn lane or receiving lane in the westbound direction of Harbor Street.
With reasonable mitigation, six of the seven study intersections show no further degradation of v/c ratios, even
with the addition of LNG import Terminal operational trips.
Because mitigation measures will either improve or maintain traffic operations along public roadways, trips
attributed to operations of the Terminal will not adversely affect traffic operations on the ESP.
The Pipeline would require inspection or monitoring at completion, but trips associated with these activities
would be infrequent and would not occur daily. Therefore, operation of the Pipeline will not adversely affect
traffic operations on public roadways within the vicinity of the Pipeline alignment.

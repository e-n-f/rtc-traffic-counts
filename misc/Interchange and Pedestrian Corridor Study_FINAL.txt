ATH-33-14.99



1.0 Executive Summary
The E. State Street Interchange and Pedestrian Corridor Study was conducted to develop
alternatives to reduce safety and congestion problems at the U.S. 33 interchange and evaluate
the addition of a sidewalk along the south side of E. State Street.

1.1 U.S. 33/E. State Street Interchange
The U.S. 33/E. State Street interchange is located less than half a mile north of the U.S. 33/
U.S. 50 interchange. U.S. 33 is classified as an urban principal arterial and E. State Street is
classified as an urban collector. Land use around the interchange is urbanized, with
development in all four quadrants. In addition to the “no build” alternative, three feasible
alternatives were developed and compared to the existing interchange to evaluate safety,
congestion, and other impacts. The alternatives are as follows:

            -   No Build: All alternatives are evaluated compared to baseline conditions
            -   Alternative 1: Diverging Diamond Interchange with Existing Ramp Configuration
            -   Alternative 2: Diverging Diamond Interchange with Elimination of Loop Ramp,
                and construction of New Ramp in Northeast Quadrant
            -   Alternative 3: Dual Roundabout Interchange

A Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) is a style of interchange in which the directions of traffic
on the minor road cross over each other to the left side of the road between the traffic signals at
the highway ramps. The benefit to this design is it allows for two-phase signal operations and
eliminates left-turn conflicts at intersections within the interchange.

Alternative 1 was the most optimal concept of all those identified as feasible. Conflict points, fuel
wasted in idling, and pollutant emissions were all reduced and no additional real estate is
required. This alternative had the lowest construction cost, $3.4 million. Alternative 1 was
selected as the preferred alternative.

1.2 E. State Street Pedestrian Corridor
There is a sidewalk on the north side of E. State Street, but none on the south side, which has
significant commercial development and where the Athens Community Center is located. There
is a large residential neighborhood located north of E. State Street. This is a safety issue for
pedestrians with destinations on the south side of E. State Street. To address this safety issue,
the study investigated the feasibility of building a sidewalk on the south side of E. State Street,
evaluating right-of-way and utility impacts. It is recommended to add a sidewalk to the south
side of E. State Street from E. Park Drive to Walmart.

1.3 Public Involvement
The study effort also included public involvement to engage stakeholders, consider public
comments in the alternatives development, and determine a consensus on the preferred
alternative of the interchange. The majority of comments received expressed concern for the
right-of-way and environmental impacts of a new ramp in Alternative 2 and potential driver
confusion caused by the change in traffic patterns associated with a Diverging Diamond
Interchange. Some people also want bike lanes added to E. State Street, in any interchange

July 2014                                                                                    Page 1

alternative. At this time bike lanes and a sidewalk on the south side of E. State Street cannot be
added due to space constraints between the walls of the existing overhead structures of U.S.
33. There is a bike path south of E. State Street that provides access to the local businesses.

2.0 Introduction
The location addressed in this study is identified as ATH-33-14.99. This study area is split into
two parts in Athens, Ohio. Part 1 is the U.S. 33 and E. State Street interchange and part 2 is the
section of E. State Street directly east of the interchange. The intersections included in part 2
are the following:
            - E. State Street & E. Park Drive
            - E. State Street & Charles Street
            - E. State Street & Eden Place
            - E. State Street & Kroger/Big Lots Drives
            - E. State Street & Walmart Drive
The purpose of part 1 of this study is to analyze the traffic data at the interchange and identify
countermeasures that could reduce traffic congestion and related safety problems. For part 2,
the purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of adding a sidewalk along the south side of E. State
Street and determine the cost and right-of-way impact of a new sidewalk.

Numerous projects have already been completed to help mitigate the traffic congestion at the
U.S. 33/E. State Street Interchange. These projects include lane marking changes under the
U.S. 33 structures (2008), signal optimization (2009), and the raising of the median between the
U.S. 33 westbound ramps and Strathmore Blvd.



3.0 U.S. 33/E. State Street Interchange
The U.S. 33/E. State Street interchange is located less than half a mile north of the U.S. 33/
U.S. 50 interchange. Within the study area, U.S. 33 is classified as an urban principal arterial
with a speed limit of 55 mph. The 2012 Traffic Survey indicates that the Average Daily Traffic
(ADT) was 24,540 with 9% trucks. E. State Street is classified as an urban collector with a
speed limit of 25 mph. Figure 1 displays the interchange area. Land use in the immediate area
is urbanized, with development in all four quadrants of the interchange.




July 2014                                                                                 Page 3

                        Figure 1 - U.S. 33/E. State Street Interchange
E. State Street is a four lane roadway with a median in the middle between the ramps for U.S.
33. The median narrows to create a left turn lane for westbound E. State Street traffic to get on
to U.S. 33 East. U.S. 33 is a divided highway with two structures over E. State Street. The
southeast quadrant holds the U.S. 33 West exit ramp and entrance loop ramp and the U.S. 33
east exit and entrance ramps are located in the northwest and southwest quadrants of the
interchange, respectively.

3.1 Data Collection
Twelve hour turning movement counts were conducted at the study interchange on March 13,
2014 from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The morning peak travel time was identified from 11:45 AM to
12:45 PM. The evening peak travel time was from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM. Saturday traffic counts
were also collected on March 15, 2014. The peak hour was identified as 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.
Please refer to Appendix A for the turning movement counts.

3.2 Signal Operation
The YELLOW interval, ALL-RED clearance, WALK, and FLASH DON’T WALK intervals were all
calculated for each of the study intersections based on the guidelines set forth in the Ohio
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. There were changes at the national level in the
2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for the calculation of pedestrian clearance
times at signalized intersections. These recent changes include revising the assumed
pedestrian walking speed from 4.0 ft/sec to 3.5 ft/sec, leading to an increase in pedestrian
clearance times.
The collected field measurements were entered into a clearance interval calculation
spreadsheet with relevant formulae per the current standards. The City of Athens should
consider updating pedestrian clearance times at entrances of Kroger and Walmart to give
pedestrians more time to cross the roadway. All other existing pedestrian clearance times

July 2014                                                                                Page 4

exceed the calculated clearance times. The pedestrian walk signal timings and the traffic signal
timings are summarized below in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Please refer to Appendix B for
the vehicle and pedestrian clearance interval calculations.

 3.3 Capacity Analysis
 Intersection capacity was evaluated at the U.S. 33 E/E. State Street and U.S. 33 W/E. State
 Street intersections with VISSIM traffic software using existing conditions. Analyses were
 prepared using peak hour traffic volumes from the turning movement counts, existing lane use,
 and existing signal timing/phasing. Existing levels of service and delay are summarized in Table
 3, below. Please refer to Appendix C for the VISSIM analysis results.

 At the U.S. 33 interchange, E. State Street ranked #2648 on the ODOT crash list. An ODOT
 GCAT analysis from 2010 to 2012 reports 74 crashes with over 50% congestion-related. The
 lack of capacity of the interchange causes congestion on E. State Street and the U.S. 33
 Ramps, leading to an increase in congestion-related crashes. Please refer to Appendix D for a
 Crash Diagram and Safety Study Area visual from the ODOT Safety Study funding presentation.


 4.0 Proposed Interchange Alternatives
 E. State Street has changed greatly over the past 15 years, with new commercial development
 generating more traffic. As a result, the U.S. 33/E. State Street interchange experiences traffic
 congestion and delay. The interchange currently operates at a Level of Service “E”. ODOT
 District 10 and the City of Athens developed the following goals for the interchange study:

             -     Improve safety for motor vehicles and pedestrian traffic
             -     Achieve a Level of Service “C” or better for the design year, 2035
             -     Minimize property acquisition
             -     Minimize construction costs
             -     Minimize environmental impacts
             -     Do not impact or reconstruct the existing U.S. 33 structures over E. State Street

 Three alternatives were developed and compared to the existing interchange to evaluate safety,
 congestion and other impacts. The alternatives are as follows:

            -   Alternative 1: Diverging Diamond Interchange with Existing Ramp Configuration
            -   Alternative 2: Diverging Diamond Interchange with Elimination of Loop Ramp,
                and construction of New Ramp in Northeast Quadrant
            -   Alternative 3: Dual Roundabout Interchange


4.1 Diverging Diamond Interchange: an Introduction
A Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) is a style of interchange in which the directions of traffic
on the non-highway road cross over each other to the left side of the road between the traffic
signals at the highway ramps. The benefit to this design is it allows for two-phase signal
operations and eliminates left turn conflicts at intersections within the interchange. Figure 2
below illustrates the design of a DDI.




                          Figure 2 - Diverging Diamond Interchange

The U.S. 33/E. State Street interchange would function by crossing E. State Street eastbound
and westbound traffic to the left side of the road at the first ramp intersection. Eastbound and
westbound traffic would then travel under U.S. 33 on the left side of the roadway. When traffic
reaches the second ramp intersection, it crosses back to the right side of the roadway. This
design increases the capacity of the interchange and reduces the number of potential vehicle
conflict points (conflict points are points along a roadway where a vehicle that is crossing,
merging, or diverging from a roadway conflicts with another vehicle using the same road). A
decrease in conflict points improves safety at the intersections.

4.1.1 Diverging Diamond Interchange Locations
The first DDI was built in France more than 30 years ago; the first DDI in the U.S. was built in
Missouri in 2009. There are now approximately 20 DDI’s in the U.S., including Ohio’s first, at the
interchange of I-270 and Roberts Road in Columbus, which opened in 2013. Fourteen states
have at least one DDI in operation; six other states have DDI’s under construction, and still six
more states have DDI’s in advanced design. Figure 3 maps the location and status of DDI
development in the U.S., and Figure 4 is a picture taken on the opening day of the first DDI in
the U.S.

4.2    Alternative 1: Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) with Existing Ramp
       Configuration
This alternative incorporates all existing ramps into the design. An additional eastbound
through/right lane would be developed to serve the U.S. 33 east and U.S. 33 west ramps. A
third lane on the U.S. 33 west exit ramp would be developed to accommodate the heavy right
turn movement from the ramp onto E. State Street. In the design year, all movements were at a
Level of Service “C” or better. In terms of safety, conflict points were reduced by nearly a third
when compared to the No Build alternative. Figure 5, below, provides an illustration of this
alternative.

4.3 Alternative 2: DDI with Elimination of Loop Ramp, and Construction of New Ramp
This alternative uses the northeast quadrant to build a new ramp for U.S. 33 West and
eliminates the use of the existing loop ramp to make the interchange a full diamond interchange.
This alternative would allow for the addition of a westbound left turn lane in between the
interchange for the U.S. 33 east entrance ramp. A third lane on the U.S. 33 west exit ramp
would be developed to accommodate the heavy right turn movement from the ramp onto E.
State Street. This alternative is similar to the first DDI alternative in performance with the
notable exception of the Saturday peak hour performance which was a Level of Service “D” for
the westbound though/right movements at the U.S. 33 west ramps. Figure 6, below, provides an
illustration of this alternative.

4.4 Dual Roundabout Interchange
A Dual Roundabout Interchange would replace the existing intersections at the end of the ramps
with multilane roundabouts. SIDRA, roundabout analysis software, was used to analyze the
levels of service for the interchange in the AM, PM, and Saturday peaks. It was determined that

July 2014                                                                              Page 11
 E. State Street Interchange and Pedestrian Corridor Study
 ATH-33-14.99

 this alternative could not adequately manage the traffic at the interchange. Several movements
 were at a Level of Service “F” in the analysis. This alternative also has more property impacts
 and a higher construction cost than the DDI alternative. A dual roundabout interchange was not
 studied further due to its inability to service the levels of traffic.


 5.0 Capacity Analysis
 Intersection capacity was evaluated at the U.S. 33 E/E. State Street and U.S. 33 W/E. State
 Street intersections with VISSIM traffic software using the proposed conditions for both DDI
 alternatives.

 The capacity results for the DDI with the existing ramp configuration (Alternative 1), discussed in
 Section 4.2, were all at a Level of Service “C” or higher for every movement at the two
 intersections. All of the overall intersections Levels of Service were given a “B” except for the
 Saturday peak at the U.S. 33 East intersection. Proposed levels of service and delay results for
 Alternative 1 are summarized below in Table 4.

 The capacity results for the DDI with the construction of a new ramp (Alternative 2) were all at a
 Level of Service “C” or higher except for the Saturday peak for the westbound through and
 westbound right movements at the U.S. 33 West intersection which produced a Level of Service
 “D.” Proposed levels of service and delay results for Alternative 2 are summarized below in
 Table 5. Please refer to Appendix C for the VISSIM analysis results for all movements at the
 interchange.

6.0 Proposed Interchange Alternatives Evaluation
The interchange alternatives were evaluated based on the stakeholder’s goals for the project.
The study team assigned the following metrics for the stakeholder’s goals:

            -   Safety
                     i. Number of Conflict Points (fewer is safer)
                    ii. Pedestrian Accommodations
            -   Traffic Congestion in Design Year 2035
                     i. PM Peak Hour Congestion (minimum acceptable Level of Service “C”)
                    ii. Saturday Peak Hour Congestion (minimum acceptable Level of Service
                        “C”)
            -   Environmental Impacts
                     i. Fuel Consumption in PM Peak Hour (more idling vehicles use more fuel)
                    ii. PM Peak Air Pollutant Emissions (CO, NOx, VOC)
            -   Property Impacts
                     i. Property taken for U.S. 33 Eastbound Ramps
                    ii. Property taken for U.S. 33 Westbound Ramps
            -   Construction Cost
                     i. Capital cost of construction and right-of-way acquisition

Alternative 1, the DDI with existing ramp configurations, was the most optimal concept
compared to the existing conditions. Conflict points, fuel wasted in idling, and pollutant
emissions were all reduced and no additional real estate was required. This alternative had the
lowest construction cost of $3.4 million.

Alternative 2, DDI with Full Diamond Ramps, performed similarly to Alternative 1 except for
during the Saturday peak hours. There is property acquisition and cost of $620,000 for the new
ramp in the northeast quadrant. This alternative was estimated at $5.0 million for construction
costs.

Alternative 3, a Roundabout Interchange, could not adequately service traffic and had more
property impacts and higher construction costs than the DDI alternatives.

E. State Street Interchange and Pedestrian Corridor Study
ATH-33-14.99


7.0 E. State Street Pedestrian Improvements
Public officials are concerned about the lack of sidewalks along the south side of E. State Street
where commercial development and the Athens Community Center are located. To the north of
E. State Street there is a large residential neighborhood. This is perceived as a safety issue for
pedestrians with destinations on the south side of E. State Street.

The study team evaluated the cost and right-of-way impact of constructing a sidewalk on the
south side of E. State Street from E. Park Dr. to Walmart. Due to elevation differences, small
retaining walls will need to be built in front of the parking lot of the Ponderosa Restaurant and
People’s Bank. The estimated construction cost of the sidewalk is $376,000, based on an 8’
sidewalk width. Some cost could be mitigated by narrowing the width of the sidewalk to 7’ in
order to avoid utility pole relocation. The proposed sidewalk on the south side of E. State Street
does not extend west of E. Park Dr. to the interchange because the existing bridge structures of
U.S. 33 do not allow enough space underneath them for an additional sidewalk on the south
side. Please refer to Figure 7 for an illustration of the proposed sidewalk and Appendix G for a
diagram of the proposed pedestrian improvements




Figure 7 - Typical E. State Street Section Showing Proposed Sidewalks



7.1 Right of Way
It is necessary to acquire a small amount of right-of-way, less than 0.2 acres, for the sidewalk.
At current market value, the right-of-way is estimated to cost $140,000.

7.2 Utility Impacts
The placement of the full 8’ wide sidewalk may have significant utility impacts, though most of it
can be built around utility obstructions if narrowed in spots.

8.0 Public Involvement
The study effort included public involvement to engage stakeholders and the public, consider
public comments in the alternatives development, and determine a consensus on the preferred
alternative.

There were three modes of public involvement: a study Steering Committee, a Public
Involvement Meeting, and print/electronic media dissemination.

            -   The Steering Committee was made up of stakeholders from the City of Athens
                administrative officials, city council, and ODOT (Please refer to Appendix F for
                the Steering Committee roster). The Steering Committee represented critical
                public interests, guided the scope of the study, helped identify issues and
                developed goals for the study’s outcome. As community leaders, the Steering
                Committee had ready access to project data, historical knowledge of the area
                and issues, and overall sensibility of public needs and concerns.
            -   A public meeting was held on May 8th, 2014 at the Athens Community Center to
                gather input from citizens about the proposed project and its potential impacts.
                ODOT and the City of Athens published notice of the meeting via a press release
                and notice on their respective websites. The meeting was conducted from 3:00
                PM to 7:00 PM to allow attendance by the public during and after normal working
                hours. The purpose and need of the project, conceptual alternatives and a
                preferred alternative were presented at the meeting. The meeting included
                informational displays, VISSIM model videos, a PowerPoint presentation, fact
                sheets, and a form for submitting public comments. Please refer to Appendix G
                for these materials; the informational displays and VISSIM model videos are
                included on the CD copy.
            -   The Public Involvement Meeting attracted electronic and print media. There were
                at least three stories in local newspapers about the project (Appendix H), and the
                formal presentation during the meeting was videotaped by the local public
                television station. Subsequently, the Athens government access television station
                rebroadcast the videoed meeting presentation, which included contact
                information for public comment. Also, the City of Athens developed a page on
                their website dedicated to the project, and posted meeting material including
                briefing papers, the PowerPoint presentation and video traffic simulations.

The public comment was open from May 8th through June 30th, 2014, with a total of 13 individual
comments received. The comments are included in Appendix H and categorized below:

            -   Desire for bicycle accommodations on roadway (3 comments)
            -   Concern about noise impact of the new ramp in Alternative 2 (3 comments)
            -   Concern about confusion caused by the change in traffic patterns, especially for
                older and international drivers (2 comments)
            -   Concern about confusion caused by the additional lane in Alternative 1 for
                eastbound State Street traffic getting on U.S. 33 West (2 comments)
            -   Desire for lighting along E. State Street for pedestrians and bicyclists (2
                comments).
            -   Concern about impact of Alternative 2 on the Athens County Children Services
                property (2 comments)



July 2014                                                                                Page 16

ATH-33-14.99

In summary, the majority of comments received were in reference to the concern about the
impact of a new ramp in Alternative 2 and potential driver confusion caused by a change in
traffic patterns associated with a Diverging Diamond Interchange configuration, which would be
new to the Athens area.


9.0 Conclusions and Recommendations
This study was initiated due to increased congestion along E. State Street that was generating
safety concerns for the U.S. 33 interchange and pedestrian traffic along E. State Street. The
goals for the interchange set by ODOT District 10 and the City of Athens were:

            -   Improve safety for motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic
            -   Achieve a Level of Service “C” or better for the design year, 2035
            -   Minimize property acquisition
            -   Minimize construction cost
            -   Minimize environmental impacts
            -   Do not impact or reconstruct the existing U.S. 33 structures over E. State Street

Alternative 1 – the interchange of a DDI with the existing ramp configurations – meets all of
these goals. In the capacity analysis, the levels of service are a “C” or better for every
movement in the design year. The DDI configuration utilizes the existing ramps to minimize
construction costs and does not impact the existing U.S. 33 structures. In addition, the
alternative stays within the existing right-of-way to eliminate property acquisitions and minimize
environmental impacts. On July 17, 2014, the City of Athens and ODOT issued a joint press
release which announced this as their preferred alternative moving forward (see Appendix I).

Bike lanes and a sidewalk on the south side of the road cannot be added to the DDI due to
space constraints between the walls of the existing overhead structures of U.S. 33. When/if the
bridges are replaced, the width under the bridges can be expanded to allow for bike lanes and a
second sidewalk through the interchange. In the meantime, there is a bike path that runs south
of E. State Street that provides access to the local businesses.

It is also recommended that the City of Athens move ahead with plans to add a sidewalk on the
south side of E. State Street to improve pedestrian accommodations. The majority of comments
received from the community welcomed the idea of a new sidewalk.

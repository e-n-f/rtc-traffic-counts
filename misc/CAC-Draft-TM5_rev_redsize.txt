What Makes Scappoose Unique?
The City of Scappoose is located approximately 30 miles north of Portland on Highway 30 along the
Columbia River, as shown in Figure 1. Scappoose maintains a small town feel but is still conveniently
close for an easy trip into Oregon's biggest metropolitan area. The city is within a half-hour drive to
Portland and an hour-and-a-half drive to the Oregon Coast. The city limits are located approximately one
mile west of the Multnomah
Channel of the Columbia River.

Scappoose is bordered by the
Multnomah Channel on the east
side and abutted by farms and rural
forests on its other borders. The city
lies in Columbia County and just
over the West Hills from
Washington County, a major
employment center for the Portland
metropolitan region. This setting,
with its relatively short commutes
to downtown Portland and the
Silicon Forest of Washington
County, has proved attractive to
new residents as the population has
grown from 4,976 in the 2000 U.S.
Census to 6,592 in 2010. 1 The City
of Scappoose continues to be an
attractive location to visit and live.

Where Do People Want to Go?
The planning efforts for this Transportation System Plan (TSP) update focus on ways to enhance the City
of Scappoose as a whole. City planners identified key intersections that will be evaluated as part of this
TSP. These 21 intersections are shown in Figure 2, as well as the major roadways and intersections that
were reviewed for motor vehicle, pedestrian, and freight activity.

Planning for a transportation system that meets the city's needs requires an understanding of key travel
destinations throughout the area--locations that create demand for travel because they are where
people go to work, to school, or to take care of business or other daily needs. Destinations may also be
attractions that draw travelers from around the region.
These key destinations can be thought of as activity
generators, or trip attractors.

The most common categories of activity generators in or
near Scappoose are (examples are listed with each
category):

        Recreational (trails, Multnomah Channel, Cinema, city
        parks, Scappoose RV Park)

        Schools (Scappoose High School, Scappoose Middle
        School, Grant Watts Elementary, Petersen Elementary)

        Places of employment (business and industrial locations)

        Shopping (grocery stores, restaurants)

        Public transportation (bus stops, park and ride)

        Tourist Locations (Watts House Pioneer Museum)

        Aviation (Scappoose Industrial Airpark, Chinook Ultralight
        Airport)

All of these activity generator types represent important
starting and ending points for travel in Scappoose, and they
provide a basis for assessing important travel routes.


How Do People Get There?
Planning for an effective transportation system also means
understanding how Scappoose residents, workers, and                         Figure 2: Study Intersections
students choose to travel to and from destinations--by
foot, bicycle, public transportation, motor vehicle, or other mode. Understanding mode choice means
assessing existing travel patterns and activity levels and looking at the underlying factors particular to
Scappoose that inform mode choice.

The Commute to Work
Travel occurs for many reasons and includes school, shopping, and recreation. The trip type that people
most often associate with traffic problems is their work trip, which typically occurs in peak traffic
conditions. In Scappoose, 80 percent of working residents commute to work by driving alone (single
occupant motor vehicle or SOV), 14 percent carpool to work, and one percent walk to work. Public

transportation (<1 percent) and bicycling (<1 percent) are not common modes for the journey to work,
and 4 percent to 5 percent work at home.

Table 1 compares Scappoose residents' commute to work to that of residents of Columbia County and
Oregon statewide. Compared to the statewide average, the proportions of Scappoose residents driving
alone and carpooling to work were both slightly higher, and the percentage commuting by transit, biking
and walking is lower. Overall, the percentage for Scappoose and Columbia County is similar, although
more Scappoose residents carpool than Columbia County residents.

While data on commute-to-work mode choice is needed to understand major travel patterns, it is
important not to confuse this with overall levels of activity for different travel modes. Work trips for
Scappoose residents cover long distances in many cases, with over 80 percent of work trip destinations
outside of Columbia County. Non-motor vehicle modes tend to be more likely for shorter non-work trips
to and from other activity generators like schools, recreation, and shopping.

Existing Activity Levels
Pedestrian, bicycle, and motor vehicle activity at study intersections throughout Scappoose was
reviewed for the p.m. peak period (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) on a typical weekday in April, 2013. 2
Pedestrian and bicycle activity for the 21 study intersections during the p.m. peak hour is shown in
Figure 3. The counts were taken during the school year and when the weather was not a deterrent for
pedestrians and bicycles. However, in summer months, activity levels are generally higher due to
pleasant weather enticing residents to venture outside. Although weekend activity levels were not
measured, because of the potential for more shopping and recreational travel on weekends, pedestrian
and bicycle activity would be expected to be higher.

Pedestrian Volumes
Of all the study intersections reviewed, the West Lane Road/Columbia Avenue intersection had the most
pedestrian activity (over 50 crossings during the evening peak hour). Several locations on Highway 30
also had notably higher levels of pedestrian crossing activity than the other study intersections; three
locations--High School Way, Columbia Avenue, and Maple Street--each had 20 to 30 pedestrians during
the p.m. peak hour. These higher activity locations are near commercial centers in town. Adequate
sidewalks and crossings are generally provided near US 30; however, many of the side streets (e.g.,
Columbia Avenue and Maple Street) have missing or poor quality pedestrian facilities.

The intersection of 6th Street and High School
Way also had notably high pedestrian
volumes (19 during the p.m. peak hour). This
intersection links Scappoose High School with
adjacent neighborhoods. There are some
sidewalks on the high school property, but
the surrounding neighborhoods typically do
not have sidewalks available. A modest
number of pedestrians were observed at
several other intersections in Scappoose.

No pedestrians were observed at three of the        Pedestrians Crossing Railroad Track near US 30
intersections (all located at the edge of the
urban growth boundary where there is very little commercial or residential development) during the
p.m. peak hour.

Bicycle Volumes
During the weekday p.m. peak period, bicycle volumes are low (four bikes or less per intersection during
the p.m. peak hour) in Scappoose. The intersections that had the highest bicycle volumes were at Old
Portland Road/Sequoia Street, with a total of four bicycles during the p.m. peak hour, and at these three
intersections--US 30/Old Portland Road/Bonneville, West Lane/Crown Zellerbach, and Eggleston
Lane/E.M. Watts Road--where three bicyclists were observed during the p.m. peak hour. The majority
of the study intersections had either one bicyclist or no bicycle activity during the p.m. peak hour.

Bicycle use tends to vary seasonally, as warmer, dryer weather and longer daylight hours make it a more
attractive travel mode, so it is expected that bicycle volumes would be higher in the summer months.
Bicycle activity is shown at the study intersections for the p.m. peak hour in Figure 3.

Motor Vehicle Volumes
Figure 4 shows historical growth on Highway US 30 over the past six years (measured at two locations
(north of E.M. Watts Road and north of north city limits). Average daily traffic (ADT) volumes have
remained relatively constant north of the city limits (at approximately 25,000 vehicles daily) and
declined somewhat in the middle of town (27,000 to 32,000 vehicles daily). Traffic volumes peaked in
2007, with the subsequent declining traffic volumes likely associated with the economic downturn
starting in 2008. 3

Figure 5 shows the volumes on US 30 for a typical weekday.4 While traffic peaks during both the
morning and evening peak periods, the evening peak is higher overall (total of both directions). This is
typical in most communities due to more shopping and other trips that occur simultaneously with the
evening peak commute traffic.

Review of traffic count data showed that weekday traffic volumes were highest for roadways in
Scappoose between 4:45 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. Motor vehicle activity varies somewhat depending on time
of year. Warmer weather brings an influx of visitors to Columbia County destinations and the Oregon
Coast via US 30. Because of these important seasonal variations, traffic count data was adjusted to
represent the 30th highest annual hour (30 HV). The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) uses
the analysis from the 30th highest annual hour as a basis for its design recommendations.

                                                       Figure 5: Hourly Traffic Volume Profile on US 30

Intersection traffic count data was collected in Scappoose in the month of April and required adjustment
in order to represent peak seasonal conditions using methodology from the ODOT Analysis Procedures
Manual. 5 Adjustments were made based on data available for similar facilities in Oregon. The 30th
highest annual hour and average weekday traffic volumes developed for the study intersections are
provided in Figure 6a and 6b, respectively.

Generally, traffic volumes during the p.m. peak hour on Highway 30 are higher in the central part of
Scappoose, near Maple Street and E.M. Watts Road, and through the downtown area. During the a.m.
peak hour volumes along US 30 are higher in the southbound direction and, during the p.m. peak hour,
higher in the northbound direction, suggesting that much of the volume is commuter traffic to and from
the Portland metro area.

                             Peak Seasonal Volumes: The collected count data was factored upward to replicate the conditions when
                             traffic volumes are typically highest (summer). A seasonal factor was established using the Seasonal Trend
                             Method (averaging "commuter" and "summer" trends) for intersections on US 30 and a "commuter"
                             trend for those on local Scappoose streets. Peak seasonal motor vehicle volumes are highest on US 30
                             between Maple Street and E.M. Watts Road, generally ranging between 2,100 and 2,250 vehicles in the
                             peak direction (northbound) and between 1,000 and 1,150 vehicles in the opposite direction
                             (southbound) during the evening peak hour. The total volume of motor vehicles traveling through
                             intersections off US 30 during the evening peak hour is generally less than 400 vehicles during the peak
                             season.



5 ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual, April, 2006. The Appendix contains additional information on the seasonal
factoring methodology. To obtain traffic volumes that would reflect the 30th highest design hour, a factor of 1.15 was
applied to the existing traffic volumes on US 30 and a factor of 1.05 was applied on local Scappoose streets. To obtain
traffic volumes that would reflect the average evening peak hour, a factor of 1.0 was applied to the existing traffic
volumes on US 30 and a factor of 0.95 was applied on local Scappoose streets.

   Average Weekday Volumes: The collected count data was factored to replicate average weekday traffic
   volumes for the year (typically in the spring or fall). Using the commuter/summer trend for intersections
   on US 30 and a commuter trend for those on local Scappoose streets, average weekday peak factors were
   established. During an average weekday, there are approximately 450-500 fewer vehicles traveling
   through intersections on US 30 intersections between Maple Street and E.M. Watts Road compared to
   the peak season. At most intersections reviewed off US 30, volumes generally decrease less than 40
   vehicles on an average weekday compared to the peak season.

What Factors Determine How People Get There?
The choice of how to get to a destination involves a variety of factors, such as the available modes and
individual habits. When considering how a trip will be taken--by motor vehicle, walking, bicycle, or
transit--the factors affecting choice are typically ease and convenience of travel, travel cost, and travel
time. These factors in turn depend on the particular destination, barriers to travel, and demographic
characteristics such as age and income.

Where are you going?
Scappoose residents make many types of trips--to work, school, shopping, and recreation. The type of
trip strongly influences the mode of transportation they choose. If the trip destination is a park or an
elementary school, then it is more likely one will walk or bike because these destinations are often in
one's neighborhood. Conversely, if the trip destination is work or shopping, a motor vehicle is probably
more convenient.

Where do you work and how long does it take you to get there?
Scappoose residents who work outside of Scappoose are more likely to commute by motor vehicle than
by walking or bicycling due to the relatively long trip distance. Table 2 shows the commute lengths
Scappoose residents experience compared to county and statewide figures. The U.S. Census data
confirms that a significantly higher percentage of workers in Scappoose have moderate commutes (10
to 24 miles) than typical Oregon workers since many Scappoose residents work in Portland and
Washington County. This underlines the importance of vehicular travel--by SOV, carpool, or transit--to
Scappoose residents.

Census data also reveals the commute destinations of Scappoose workers. As shown in Table 3, a
majority (81%) commute to jobs outside of Columbia County, with over three-quarters of workers
traveling south to the Portland metropolitan area and some beyond to Washington County, Clackamas
County, Salem, and other parts of Oregon. Four percent of Scappoose residents commute to various
cities in Washington State.

As noted in Table 3, most Scappoose residents work outside Scappoose (over 2,500), while almost 1,300
employees working in Scappoose live elsewhere. Only about 280 people both live and work in
Scappoose (see Figure 7).

Are there Barriers to Travel?
The topography and physical features such as waterways and hills or mountains may provide obstacles
to choosing different modes of travel and may also limit development potential in certain areas. Such
features typically deter walking and bicycling.

Figure 8 shows the topography and other physical constraints in and around Scappoose. The city is
relatively flat with hills to the west and lower elevations closer to the Columbia River on the east. There
are a number of wetlands identified east of Scappoose within the UGB. Riparian zones are the interface
between land and a river or stream. There are two significant riparian zones within the UGB, one in the
northeast area north of Crown Zellerbach Road and east of US 30 and one along Scappoose Creek east
of E.M. Watts Road.

The primary travel barriers in Scappoose include:

        US 30 is a high speed, high traffic volume arterial with a limited number of crossing opportunities.

        The Portland & Western Railroad (PNWR) operates a rail line that runs through Scappoose parallel to US
        30, about 50 feet east of the highway. Trains can cause delays of several minutes, restricting access
        between the east and west sides of Scappoose.

        Steep grades rise on the western edge of the UGB, with a substantial elevation gain west of Scappoose.
        Canyons (deep drainage ways) also prevent north-south connectivity.

        Scappoose Creek, west of US 30, offers limited crossing opportunities.

        Existing land uses, such as the gravel pit and airport in the northeast part of town limit connectivity
        opportunities.

        Private property west of Old Portland Road between Sequoia Street and Jenny Lane limits north-south
        connectivity.

The availability of sidewalks, curb ramps for ADA
access, crosswalks, bicycle lanes, and shared use
paths increase the comfort and access of walking and
biking. A lack of these facilities, particularly on high
volume or high speed roadways, discourages people
from using non-motorized modes of transportation.

Age and Income
Demographic characteristics such as age and income
typically play a role in determining how one gets to a        Gaps in Sidewalks on Collector Roadway
destination. Vehicle ownership has a strong impact on mode choice. Because residents with lower
incomes are less likely to own one or more vehicles, they often account for more trips via walking,
biking, and public transportation. Age is also a key factor, as the youngest residents cannot drive and the
oldest residents are less likely to drive.

Table 4 shows that Scappoose has a slightly higher proportion of school-age children than Columbia
County or the State of Oregon; 22 percent of the population is under 15 years old according to the 2010
U.S. Census. Conversely, Scappoose has a slightly lower proportion of people who are retirement age or
older than in the county or state.

Household income can be a major determinant of travel mode as well. Table 5 shows the household
income distribution in Scappoose, Columbia County, and the State of Oregon. There is a slightly lower
percentage of Scappoose households earning less than $50,000 a year and a higher percentage of
Scappoose households earning more than $50,000, compared to the State of Oregon. Median
household income in Scappoose is significantly higher than in the county and state, which often
indicates higher levels of vehicle ownership and use.

What Transportation Infrastructure Is Available?
Scappoose residents rely on the city's existing transportation infrastructure to travel to work, school,
recreation, and other destinations every day. The infrastructure includes sidewalks, off-street paths,
bike lanes, roadways, and transit.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
People who choose to walk or bike to their
destination in Scappoose may use sidewalks, shared
use paths, bike lanes, or shoulders. Pedestrian and
bicycle facilities also include crosswalks and curb
ramps.

Sidewalks and Crosswalks
Sidewalks on arterial and collector streets are
generally available near commercial areas and in
                                                                  Sidewalks on a newer Scappoose street
newer neighborhoods but generally are not available
in older sections of town, as shown in Figure 9.

Scappoose has a variety of pedestrian facilities throughout the city:

        Sidewalks are provided in newer commercial and
        residential areas. These areas usually abut older
        areas that do not have sidewalks, leaving gaps in
        the pedestrian network. All newer sidewalks have
        Americans with Disability Act (ADA)-compliant curb
        ramps at intersections and at driveways.

        The majority of crosswalks throughout the city are
        located at intersections. The crosswalks generally
        provide ADA-compliant curb ramps and are in
        acceptable condition at improved intersections;
        some crosswalk locations throughout the city need
        new striping. Some unimproved intersections                  Typical older Scappoose street
        have marked crosswalks that connect to unpaved             with gaps in the pedestrian system
        shoulders.

        In Scappoose, pedestrian access to transit stops is mixed. While there might be good sidewalk access in
        the immediate vicinity of the transit stop, very few locations have an extended sidewalk network of more
        than a few blocks. Good pedestrian access to transit, including the availability of sidewalks or trails,
        improves the overall level of service provided by the transit system by allowing transit users to safely and
        comfortably arrive at transit stops and increasing the likelihood individuals will choose transit as a travel
        mode.

        Curb extensions on the west side of US 30 at Columbia Avenue enhance pedestrian visibility and shorten
        the distance pedestrians must travel to cross the intersection. Curb extensions often help slow traffic as
        well by narrowing the travel way.

The ODOT standard for sidewalk width is six feet, with a minimum width of five feet acceptable on local
streets. Scappoose requires a sidewalk width of six feet on most street types. The unobstructed travel
way for pedestrians on a sidewalk should be clear of utility poles, sign posts, fire hydrants, vegetation,
and other street furnishings.

Roadway shoulders, such as those found on many
older streets in Scappoose, often serve as pedestrian
routes in rural Oregon communities. On roadways
with low traffic volumes (i.e., less than 3,000 vehicles
per day) roadway shoulders are not ideal but are
often used for pedestrian travel and are better than
roadways with adjacent ditches or no shoulder at all.
These roadways should have shoulders wide enough,
usually six feet or greater, so they can be used by
both pedestrians and bicyclists.
                                                                 Roadway shoulder wide enough for pedestrians

        A number of streets in Scappoose provide
        examples of roadways with shoulders wide enough to accommodate pedestrians (five feet or wider).
                          th           th
        These include SE 6 Street, SE 4 Street, Elm Street, Rose Lane, and others.

As indicated in Figure 9, Scappoose has installed crosswalks and ADA curb ramps at many intersections
in areas with high pedestrian use. However, in several areas outside of the downtown core the curb
ramp network is incomplete.

Shared Use Paths
Shared use paths (also referred to as multi-use paths) are used by a variety of non-motorized users,
including pedestrians, bicyclists, skateboarders, and runners. Public shared use paths are typically paved
(asphalt or concrete) but may also consist of an unpaved smooth surface as long as it meets ADA
standards. Shared use paths are usually wider than an average sidewalk (i.e., 10 to 14 feet rather than 5
to 6 feet).

The Crown Zellerbach Trail, which runs
adjacent to the Scappoose-Vernonia
Highway west of US 30, becomes an on-
street bike lane between US 30 and West
Lane Road and returns to an off-street
path just east of West Lane Road (see
Figure 10). There is a parking lot
approximately two miles west of US 30 on
Scappoose-Vernonia Highway, which
provides access to the trail. The trail is
mostly flat along an old converted rail line.
The terrain is slightly downhill from the
trailhead at the parking lot to the
Multnomah Channel at its terminus. Parts                  Crown Zellerbach Trailhead, just west of US 30

of the trail surface are paved and other parts are hard-packed gravel. The trail ranges in width from
about five feet to about 12 feet. A large portion of the trail is located outside city limits.

Currently, there are no other designated shared use paths in Scappoose.

Bike Lanes
Bike lanes are portions of the roadway
that are designed specifically for bicycle
travel with a striped lane and stenciling
indicating bicycle use. ODOT standard
width for a bike lane is six feet. 6 The
minimum width of a bicycle lane
against a curb or adjacent to on-street
parking is five feet. A bicycle lane as
narrow as four feet is allowed but only
in very constrained conditions.
Scappoose street standards require six-
foot bike lanes with specific bikeway                     Bike lanes on Crown Zellerbach Road

locations to be determined by the city. Existing bicycle facilities in Scappoose are shown in Figure 10 and
described below:

         US 30: six-foot (minimum) bike lanes are present in both directions along US 30 through Scappoose. These
         existing facilities provide bicycle access to many of the attractions in town, including shopping and
         services. Bicyclists traveling longer distances (i.e., between Portland and the Oregon Coast) may also use
         these facilities.

         Old Portland Road: six-foot bike lanes (or greater) are provided in both directions from just south of
         Dutch Canyon Road to Bonneville Drive.

         Crown Zellerbach Road: five-foot bike lanes are present in both directions between US 30 and West Road.
         These bike lanes connect between the two sections of the Crown Zellerbach Trail to both the east and the
         west.
                           nd
         Havlik Drive/SE 2 Street: five-foot bike lanes are present in both directions between US 30 and
         Frederick Street.
                                                                                             nd                    th
         Frederick Street: six-foot bike lanes are present in both directions between SE 2 Street and SE 6 Street.

Shared Roadway/Signed Shared Roadway
Shared roadways occur where bicycles and motor vehicles must use the same travel lane. The most
appropriate roadways for this type of shared use are those with low speeds (25 m.p.h. or less) and low
traffic volumes (3,000 vehicles per day or fewer). 7 Signed shared roadways are where facilities are
designated and signage indicates the bicycle routes; these facilities provide continuity to other bicycle
facilities (e.g., bicycle lanes) or are designated as a preferred route through a community. Such a route
typically has signs indicating its shared street status and often has shared roadway pavement markings.



6ODOT, "Oregon Bicycle & Pedestrian Plan" (latest edition.)
7The Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices guidance states that shared lane
markings should not be placed on roadways with a speed limit above 35 m.p.h. http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/


                                                       Draft Existing Conditions                  Page 22

Common practice is to sign the route with standard MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices)
green bicycle route signs with directional arrows. Shared roadways can also be signed with innovative
signing that highlights a special touring route, such as the Oregon Coast Bike Route, or provides
directional information such as bicycling minutes or distance, such as "Library, 3 minutes, ½ mile." There
are currently no signed shared roadways in Scappoose. All local streets in Scappoose are relatively low
speed, low volume roadways that could be classified as shared roadways.

Shoulder Bikeway
Shoulder bikeways are paved roadways with striped shoulders wide enough for bicycle travel. ODOT
recommends a six-foot paved shoulder and a four-foot minimum width in constrained areas to provide
adequate passage for bicyclists. Roadways with shoulders less than four feet are considered shared
roadways. Sometimes shoulder bikeways are signed to alert motorists to expect bicycle travel along the
roadway.

Most streets in Scappoose do not provide striping, either with a center line or a fog line. Therefore,
there are no streets with adequate striped shoulders to accommodate bikes. However, many streets in
Scappoose are relatively wide and can easily accommodate bikes; however, these should be grouped in
the previous category as "shared roadway."

Bike Parking
Where one stores one's bike upon reaching the destination is an important part of bicycle
infrastructure. If there is nowhere safe and secure to park the bike, one is less likely to ride even if the
trip distance and the roadway facilities are right for cycling. Bicycle parking can be broadly defined as
either short-term or long-term parking:

        Short-term parking is intended to accommodate visitors, customers, messengers, and others expected to
        depart within two hours; it requires an approved standard rack and appropriate location and placement.

        Long-term parking is intended to accommodate employees, students, residents, commuters, and others
        expected to park more than two hours. This parking should be in a secure location protected from the
        weather.

Very little bike parking was observed in downtown Scappoose where there is the highest concentration
of activity centers and some of the most likely bicycle destinations.

Transit Facilities
Transit service is offered in Scappoose by the Columbia County Rider (CC Rider), a service of Columbia
County Transit Division (CCTD). CC Rider provides fixed-route, flex-route, and dial-a-ride services within
Columbia County and to adjacent counties.

Five fixed-route transit lines carry passengers to and from various locations within Columbia County and
destinations popular among Columbia County
residents, such as:

        St. Helens/Scappoose to
        Hillsboro/Beaverton

        St. Helens/Scappoose to downtown
        Portland

        Westport/Clatskanie, Rainier, and
        Longview/Kelso in Washington

        Nehalem Valley

                                                           (One of the first modes of bus transportation from
        (Saturday/Sunday only)
                                                                Columbia County to the Portland area)

These routes run only on weekdays; there are                   Source: Columbia County Transit Division
routes south to Portland and north to Westport
with limited service on weekends.

The primary transit stop in Scappoose is located at NE 1st Street between
Columbia Avenue and Prairie Street, near City Hall. All CC Rider buses
that stop in Scappoose use this stop. There is also a park and ride lot at
this location.

The flex route runs on an approximate schedule to allow for minor route
deviations to assist elderly or disabled passengers as well as any member
of general public who may have difficulty getting to a Flex Route bus
stop. Riders are asked to arrive at their stop five minutes early. The
south flex route has several stops in Scappoose. Transit routes in                        Columbia County
Scappoose and Columbia County are shown in Figure 11.                                   Rider Park & Ride Sign


Monthly ridership data is available for the Columbia County transit routes. Total ridership data for each
route is provided but not separated for specific stops or portions of a route (such as exclusively in
Scappoose). The south flex route served approximately 11,000 passengers in the 2011/2012 fiscal year.
During the first nine months of the 2012/2013 fiscal year, the south flex route served approximately
9,400 passengers, a seven percent increase over the comparable months of the preceding fiscal year.

Transit Service for People with Disabilities
CC Rider provides demand responsive (dial-a-ride) service for people with disabilities who are unable to
use regular fixed-route buses and for people whose origins and/or destinations are not within close
proximity (generally three-quarter mile) of fixed-route or flex-route services. This curb-to-curb service,
provided by smaller buses equipped with wheelchair lifts, is available Monday through Friday between
6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.

Transit Access and Amenities
Scappoose has one primary transit stop at NE 1st Street/Prairie Street, which is fairly centrally located in
town. The stop is accessible from the west using a signalized US 30 pedestrian crossing with curb ramps
and a sidewalk on one side of Columbia Avenue. The stop is close to key activity centers, such as City
Hall, the library, the Watts House Pioneer Museum, and several restaurants and local businesses. The
property is owned by ODOT and continued use of this site is not guaranteed.

None of the transit stops (primary stop or flex stops) in the city are covered or provide benches but
many are sidewalk- and bicycle-accessible. There are signs indicating some of the bus stops in town, but

Motor Vehicle Facilities
Within the city, roadways are under the jurisdiction of the City of Scappoose, Columbia County, or
ODOT, as shown in Figure 12, along with posted speeds. Roadways are organized by functional
classification, which provides a hierarchy of intended purposes as shown in Figure 13. Roadways with a
higher intended usage generally have a classification and related standards that promote more efficient
vehicle movement through the city, while roadways with lower intended usage are classified to provide
greater access to local destinations such as businesses or residences.

In Scappoose, US 30 is the only roadway under ODOT jurisdiction and is classified as a Statewide
Highway and as a Rural Principal Arterial ­ Other. 8 It is also part of the National Highway System (NHS), a
Freight Route and a Truck Route. The major characteristics of US 30 within Scappoose are listed in Table
7.

                                             foot)


Columbia County classifies roadways in Scappoose under the jurisdiction of the Columbia County Road
Department. These are:

          Minor Arterial: Scappoose-Vernonia Highway

          Major Collectors: Columbia Avenue, West Lane Road, Dutch Canyon Road, E.M. Watts Road, Keys Road,
          J.P. West Road, Honeyman Road, and E.J. Smith Road

          Rural Locals: Callahan Road, Eastview Drive, Sandberg Road, Wheeler Street, North Road, Bird Road, and
          Miller Road

All of the Columbia County roads within Scappoose are typically two-lane roads with varying shoulder
width. Many of the county roadways do not meet either county or City of Scappoose standards.
However, county roads are more likely to have striping (centerline, fog line) than city streets (since
many have no striping at all).

The City of Scappoose currently has the following classifications: Arterials, Major Collectors, Minor
Collectors, and Local streets. The only arterial in the city is US 30, which easily carries the highest traffic
volume in Scappoose.

Arterials generally carry some of the highest volumes in the city and are used by residents to connect to
locations both in and out of the city.

Roadways that connect neighborhoods
and major activity generators to
arterials are generally classified as
collectors. Collectors provide greater
accessibility to neighborhoods than
arterials and provide moderately
efficient through movement for local
traffic. The City of Scappoose has two
classifications for collectors: Major
Collectors and Minor Collectors. E.M.
                                                         Traffic on US 30 during the evening peak
Watts Road and East Columbia Avenue
are examples of major collector streets
that provide connections between the commercial areas of town and the neighborhoods. Collectors
typically have a posted speed of 25 to 35 miles per hour within Scappoose.

Roadways that provide more direct access to residential areas are typically classified as local streets.
This classification is typically a low volume street, often lined with residences. Most local city streets are
posted at 25 miles per hour.

Downtown Parking
The existing downtown on-street parking supply is shown in Figure
14. On the west side of downtown, parallel parking is provided along
the west side of US 30, along the majority of NW 1st Street, and the
majority of the cross streets between J.P. West Road and Laurel
Street.

On-street parking in most locations downtown is not restricted to
any time limit. A detailed parking survey was not conducted for the
downtown area; however, field observations throughout the
weekday found on-street parking had a low occupancy with a
moderate number of empty spaces.

There are a number of off-street parking lots available as well,
generally with access from NW 1st Street or side streets on the west
side and from various streets on the east side (1st Street, Columbia
Avenue, 2nd Street, etc.). Similar to on-street parking, these parking
                                                                                Figure 14: Downtown On-
lots are not restricted to any time limit nor do they charge for parking.             Street Parking
Off-street parking was also observed to have a moderate number of
empty spaces.

Freight Facilities
ODOT classifies Highway 30 as a freight, truck, and NHS route through Scappoose (see Figure 15). Truck
freight movements involve shipments both to and from locations in the city and shipments that pass
through the city. Freight volumes on US 30 through the downtown are greater than 200 trucks during
the evening peak period (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.), which account for roughly 3.5 percent of traffic.

The City of Scappoose has prohibited vehicles longer than 30 feet from using NE 2nd Street between NE
Williams Street and NE Crown Zellerbach Road. 9 This route had provided a convenient link between
heavy industrial uses in the north part of Scappoose to restaurants and services downtown, particularly
at lunch time. However, this local residential street was not intended to serve large trucks, which
residents find incompatible with the neighborhood character.

Rail Facilities
The PNWR operates a rail line that runs parallel to Highway 30 through Scappoose (see Figure 15). The
PNWR is a 520-mile short line freight railroad that interchanges with the Albany & Eastern Railroad,
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, Central Oregon & Pacific Railroad, Coos Bay Rail Link, Hampton
Railway, Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad, and Union Pacific Railroad. Commodities transported include
aggregates, brick and cement, chemicals, construction and demolition debris, food and feed products,
forest products, metallic ores and minerals, and steel and scrap. 10

PNWR reports an average of three train movements per day during the week (Monday through Friday)
and two train movements per day on the weekend (Saturday/Sunday). Trains originate and are destined
for the Northwest Portland/Vancouver area and serve Scappoose and points west of Scappoose as far as
Wauna.

The Federal Railroad Administration designates six classes for rail tracks to set maximum train speeds
based on the conditions of the tracks. The tracks within Scappoose are designated as Class 2, which
limits train speeds to 25 miles per hour. All trains are required to provide audible warning at all crossings
in Scappoose, with no restrictions or exceptions.

There are seven public railroad crossings in Scappoose located at West Lane Road, Crown Zellerbach
Road, Columbia Avenue, Maple Street, High School Way, Havlik Drive, and Johnsons Landing Road. The
mainline railroad crossings in Scappoose are all at grade and controlled with crossing gates and flashers.
There is a second railroad crossing at Columbia Avenue serving a short secondary track east of the
mainline that is controlled with yield signs. These rail crossings are shown in Figure 15. All railroad
crossings are located adjacent to an intersection on US 30, which can create vehicle operation issues
due to the short lane lengths and setback stop bars.

School buses are required to open their doors prior to
crossing railroad tracks. This results in additional delay
at the High School Way/US 30 intersection during the
morning and afternoon peak hours when there is a
high volume of school buses.

There are no passenger rail services near the study
area. The nearest Amtrak station, which serves
                                                                Railroad Crossing on Columbia Avenue near US 30
passengers, is located in Portland.

Air Facilities
Within Scappoose there is one airport (Scappoose Industrial Airpark) that is owned by the Port of St.
Helens (a local municipal corporation). The airpark, located in northeast Scappoose, has a paved and
lighted runway that is 5,100 feet in length and 100 feet in width. Aircraft operations (takeoffs or
landings) average about 210 per day or over 75,000 annually. The airpark is available for public use and
offers general flight instruction and airplane rental and maintenance services, as well as private
helicopter and recreational hot-air ballooning services. Approximately 57 aircraft, mostly single-engine
airplanes, are based on the field, and there are 120 T-hangars and paved tie-downs. The airpark provides
"reliever" capabilities to Hillsboro and Portland International airports and is also the home of several
airport related business, including:

        TransWestern Aviation, Inc. (the airport's fixed base operator)

        Oregon Aero
        Composites Unlimited

        Overall Aircraft Services (aka Evergreen Aviation)

        Northwest Antique Airplane Club

        Sherpa Aircraft

        Sport Copter

        Columbia Aviation

The Chinook Ultralight Airpark is a private ultralight flightpark located east of Scappoose.

The nearest airport with scheduled passenger service is the Portland International Airport, located
approximately 16 nautical miles southeast of Scappoose. This airport is owned by the Port of Portland,
has three runways (7,000 feet, 8,000 feet, and 11,000 feet), and serves over 14 million passengers and

Waterway Facilities
The Columbia River is located approximately one mile east of Scappoose and provides many
opportunities for recreational activities. Scappoose Marine Park, operated by the Port of St. Helens, is
located off Highway 30 in Warren, just north of Scappoose. It provides public access to the Columbia
River and includes boat ramps and approximately 86 boat slips among other amenities. No direct access
to the Columbia River is provided within Scappoose city limits.

The Multnomah Channel Yacht Club is located southeast of Scappoose on the Multnomah Channel. It is
an active club with cruises and events all year round.

Pipeline Facilities
Scappoose is served by Northwest Natural Gas, which has a major natural gas distribution line that
parallels US 30. No anticipated changes are expected to this line in the near future.

There are no major water or oil pipelines within Scappoose city limits, nor are there plans to install these
in the future.

How is the Transportation System Managed?
Maintaining an acceptable level of performance for Scappoose's transportation infrastructure requires a
variety of analytical tools and assessment types. The measures used to monitor the transportation
system are described below.

Safety
The safety of the roadways and intersections in Scappoose were evaluated through collision data as part
of the TSP update. The data was reviewed to identify potential patterns for motor vehicle, pedestrian,
and bicyclist collisions.

Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Transit Facilities
The facilities of alternative modes to motor vehicle were reviewed as part of this TSP update to identify
facility deficits or potential connectivity or access improvement opportunities.

ODOT is piloting a new bicycle measure called Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (LTS). 11 Roadway segments
are classified by LTS based on roadway and intersection traffic characteristics, which can positively or
negatively influence a bicyclist's experience. LTS ranges from LTS 1 (a level most children can tolerate) to
LTS 4 (a level tolerated only by those characterized as "strong and fearless"). When roadways are
categorized as LTS 2, approximately two-thirds of riders would be comfortable. Some of the
characteristics evaluated include the following:

       x   Positive characteristics (LTS 1 or 2): Fewer travel lanes, lower traffic speeds, bike lanes,
           separated paths, traffic signals, presence of medians (for refuge crossing a major roadway
           facility), etc.

       x   Negative characteristics (LTS 3 or 4): More travel lanes, higher traffic speeds, lack of crosswalks,
           right turn lanes (vehicles cross bicyclists route), presence of a parking lane, etc.

A segment or intersection is represented by its worst LTS value. According to ODOT, the desirable LTS
for an effective bikeway system is 2, while school-area connectivity should use LTS 1 for elementary and
no more than LTS 2 for middle/high schools. LTS can be shown graphically, in a map, and can also be
summarized in tabular form (e.g. percent of roadway links LTS 2 or higher).

Roadway Jurisdiction
The standards and maintenance responsibilities depend on the roadway's jurisdiction. In Scappoose,
roadways are generally under the jurisdiction of the City, Columbia County, or ODOT. There are also
private streets and those which are public, but not maintained by the city, county or state. The
responsible jurisdiction sets standards for each roadway to maintain its intended functional
classification, which varies depending on the design speed, connectivity, and the priority for access to

fronting properties. Higher speed, regional facilities are used primarily for longer trips, while lower
speed local city streets are used primarily to access homes, shops, schools, and jobs.

Mobility Targets
Mobility is an important consideration because it measures how freely vehicle traffic can move toward
its intended destination. In general, roadway systems have their highest degree of conflicts and
associated congestion at intersections, and so the performance of a system is often defined by how well
the intersections function.

There are two methods used to gauge these conditions--one is numeric, one is a letter grade. ODOT
uses the numeric volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio method (see Table 8) as outlined in the 1999 Oregon
Highway Plan (OHP), while the City of Scappoose uses both v/c ratio and a letter grade derived from the
level of service (LOS) method.

All intersections in Scappoose must operate at or below the adopted standards; if it does not, mitigation
would be necessary to approve future growth. The adopted intersection performance targets vary by
jurisdiction of the roadways. For Scappoose, the standard for signalized intersections is a v/c ratio less
than 0.90 and LOS D; the standard for the side street approach of a stop-controlled intersection is LOS E.
For ODOT, the target for US 30 has varying v/c ratios depending on the location of the intersection
because of varying posted speeds and roadway functional classifications. The US 30 mobility target
ranges from a v/c ratio of 0.80 to 0.95, as shown in Table 9.

                 dividing the peak hour traffic volume by the hourly capacity
                 of a given intersection or movement.
                 A lower ratio indicates smooth operations and minimal
                 delays. As the ratio approaches 1.00, congestion increases
                 and performance is reduced. If the ratio is greater than
                 1.00, the turn movement, approach leg, or intersection is
                 oversaturated and usually experiences excessive queues
                 and long delays.

Intersection Geometrics
Roadways and intersections were assessed as part of this TSP update to identify geometric deficiencies
that result in user discomfort and potential safety issues. In general, roadways and intersections should
provide a clear and direct path for all modes of travel.

Roadway Connectivity
The roadway network was reviewed as part of this TSP update to identify critical gaps and opportunities
for new roadways. It is typically desirable to provide arterial street spacing of about one mile and
collector street spacing of about one-half mile.

Access Spacing
Access spacing is a broad set of techniques that balance the need to provide efficient, safe, and timely
travel with access to individual destinations. Typically, more driveways and intersections along a
roadway result in more conflict points and less efficient operations. Proper implementation of access
management techniques promotes reduced congestion and collision rates, less need for additional
highway capacity, increased energy conservation, and less air pollution.

ODOT has adopted access spacing standards and the City of Scappoose applies General Access
Management Guidelines (see Table 10). 12,13 Separate standards are provided for driveway access and are
detailed in the Scappoose Public Works Design Standards. 14

Pavement Management
In 2009, Scappoose contracted with an outside firm to determine the condition of the existing
pavement, potential repair methods and the impact of various funding levels on future network
pavement conditions. This analysis determined that the average pavement condition index (PCI) was 90
for Collector streets and 74 for Residential streets (scale of 0-100), with an average PCI of 74. 15

Revenue
The City of Scappoose funds needed improvements to the transportation system from a number of
revenue sources, as listed in Table 11. These limited funds are allocated to expenditures including
capital projects, maintenance, engineering design, and administration. On average, the city has
approximately $166,000 per year to fund capital improvements, 16 which would total approximately $3.6
million through year 2035 if current funding levels were maintained.

The total number of crashes experienced at an
intersection is typically proportional to the number of
vehicles entering it. Therefore, a crash rate describing Figure 17: Scappoose Collisions by Severity (2009-2011)
the frequency of crashes per million entering vehicles
(MEV) is used to determine if the number of crashes should be considered high. A critical crash rate that
allows for a relative comparison among intersections with similar characteristics is also computed for
each intersection. The sites that have a higher observed collision rate than the critical crash rate are
flagged for further review.

As shown in Table 12, intersection crash rates and critical crash rates were calculated (based on the past
three years of available collision data) for each of the 21 study intersections reviewed in Scappoose.

intersections.

Three intersections exceeded their comparative critical crash rates. The intersection of US 30/Havlik
Drive is a signalized intersection on the state highway, the intersection of US 30/Old Portland Road is an
unsignalized intersection on the state highway and the intersection of West Lane Road/Crown-
Zellerbach is an unsignalized intersection on the local street system.

The intersection of US 30/Havlik Drive exceeded its critical crash rate. This intersection is signalized, with
22 reported crashes in the three-year period analyzed; 12 involved minor or moderate injuries and ten
caused property damage only. There were nine rear-end crashes and eight turning crashes. A majority

were caused by driver error, including following too close, driving too fast, careless driving, etc. At least
nine of the crashes occurred prior to the intersection improvements that occurred in 2010.

The US 30/Old Portland Road intersection exceeded its critical crash rate. Of the eight crashes at this
intersection, all but one were rear-end crashes; one was a turning crash. Two involved injuries, one
including minor, moderate and severe injuries.

In the non-state route category, the West Lane Road/Crown Zellerbach intersection had a collision rate
slightly higher than the critical crash rate. West Lane Road/Crown Zellerbach Road is an un-signalized
two-way stop controlled intersection with a total of two reported crashes at this site, both resulting in
property damage only. One was caused by the driver driving too fast and the other by a broken tractor-
trailer connection, which resulted in a jackknife.

Roadway Segment Collisions
How does collision frequency on Highway 30 in Scappoose compare to other state highways in Oregon?
Crash rates identifying the number of crashes per million vehicle-miles traveled for Highway 30, as well
as statewide average crash rates for similar facilities, were obtained from ODOT's 2011 State Highway
Crash Rate Tables. 17 For comparison with statewide averages, Highway 30 was categorized as a non-
freeway principal arterial through a rural city. The reported crash rates are shown in Table 13.

Pedestrian Conditions
The existing pedestrian system in Scappoose provides a variety of facilities throughout the city, as
previously described. A number of conditions create challenges for pedestrians, including people in
wheelchairs and those with hearing or sight limitations. These include:

Lack of sidewalks: There is a lack of sidewalks in many parts of town. This is particularly true in
neighborhoods built in an era when constructing sidewalks was not required by local jurisdictions. Major
roadways with significant sidewalk gaps are Old Portland Road, Columbia Avenue, and E.M. Watts Road.

Walking to schools and parks: The pedestrian system
does not provide optimal connections for children and
families traveling between school, parks, and nearby
residential neighborhoods since many neighborhoods
do not have sidewalk facilities available. Roadways with
significant sidewalk gaps near schools include SW 4th
Street, Maple Street, SE 3rd Street, SE 3rd Place, SE Vine
Street, SE 5th Street and E.M. Watts Road. J.P. West
Road has significant sidewalk gaps connecting to                       School Pedestrian Crossing
Veterans Park. Providing safe pedestrian and bicycle
access to schools and parks is important for reducing short distance vehicle trips and encouraging active
transportation.

US 30 through center of town: Sidewalks are provided on most of the west side of US 30. However,
there are no sidewalks on either side north of Crown Zellerbach Road and south of the city limits to
Johnsons Landing Road. Crosswalks are striped at all signalized intersections on US 30, typically spaced
about a one-quarter to one-third mile apart. However, there is a gap of over one-half mile between
signals at High School Way and Havlik Drive. No unsignalized marked crosswalks are available on US 30
due to the high speed and high traffic volume on US 30. There are curb extensions on US 30 at Columbia
Avenue, which can improve the pedestrian experience. However, these curb extensions are relatively
modest and are located only on the west side of the street, limiting their utility.

Curb ramps and Chirpers: Many intersections in Scappoose have some form of curb ramp but rarely on
every corner or in compliance with current standards. Roadways serving commercial areas such as
Columbia Avenue, US 30, and NW 1st Street should provide ADA-accessibile ramps that meet current
standards. Traffic signal "chirpers" provide an audible walk indication for the visually impaired that the
walk phase is active. No traffic signal chirpers are provided in Scappoose.

Pedestrian roadway crossings: There are pedestrian crosswalks at a number of intersections in
Scappoose, particularly near schools and commercial areas where pedestrian activity is the highest. Key
marked pedestrian crossings are at intersections along Columbia Avenue between US 30 and West Lane
Road, on High School Way near the high school, and E.M. Watts Road near the middle school.

Bicycle Conditions
There are continuous bike lanes on US 30 through Scappoose, which are important on this high speed,
high traffic volume facility. However, the bikeway network in Scappoose is incomplete, with limited
roadways offering bicycle facilities. The only designated bike lanes in town are on the recently
constructed Havlik Drive (east of US 30) and SE 2nd Street between Havlik Drive and Frederick Street,
Frederick Street between SE 2nd Street and SE 6th Street, Crown Zellerbach Road between US 30 and
West Lane Road, and Old Portland Road between Holland Drive and Bonneville Drive. The majority of
the residential areas lack formally designated facilities or routes to connect them to the commercial
core.

Bicycle LTS, as described in the previous section, was measured for all roadways and intersections in
Scappoose and is summarized in Figure 18. In Scappoose, the majority of roadways are categorized as
LTS 2 or better, ODOT's guideline for an effective bikeway system. Routes in Scappoose that are LTS 3 or
LTS 4 typically include routes with more than two lanes (both directions) or higher speeds (typically
above 35 m.p.h.), including the following:

    x    US 30 both south and north of town                     x   Coal Creek Road
    x    West Lane Road                                         x   J.P. West Road
    x    Dutch Canyon Road                                      x   E.J. Smith Road
    x    E.M. Watts Road                                        x   Old Portland Road
Study intersections with crossings which are difficult for bicyclists (LTS 3 or LTS 4) include intersections
on higher speed/higher number of travel lane locations where a traffic signal is not provided:

    x   US 30/Bonneville Road/Johnson's                        x    US 30/West Lane Road
        Landing Road                                           x    West Lane Road/Honeyman Road
    x   US 30/Old Portland Road                                x    West Lane Road/Crown Zellerbach Road
    x   US 30/JP West Road


US 30 crossings: One of the most pertinent issues faced by bicyclists (and pedestrians) in Scappoose is
safe and comfortable crossings of US 30. There are six signalized crossings of US 30 (most are spaced
less than a quarter-mile apart, however further away from the downtown area, they are spaced up to a
half-mile apart); however, the high traffic volumes and vehicle speeds typically restrict bicycle crossings
to only those six locations.

Transit Conditions
Transit users are typically willing to walk up to about a quarter-mile to access transit. Relatively few
Scappoose residents have pedestrian access to either the city's primary stop or the south flex route.

The park and ride at the primary stop provides access to those transit users with a motor vehicle;
however, it does not serve those who do not have access to a car. In addition, the park and ride is
currently located on ODOT rail property and its status is not secure.

Motor Vehicle Conditions
The motor vehicle conditions in Scappoose vary based on the time of year. Operations at the 21 study
intersections, shown in Table 14, were
evaluated during the p.m. peak hour
of the peak seasonal period (30th
highest annual hour) and the average
weekday as described in the Motor
Vehicle Volumes section of this
document. While the average
weekday v/c and LOS are provided,
ODOT bases its targets on the peak
seasonal values.

Peak seasonal intersection operations                       US 30 Evening Peak Queuing

are shown in Table 14. Capacity
analysis indicates that the majority of the intersections meet ODOT's mobility standards, with a few
exceptions. Five of the intersections do not meet ODOT's mobility standards. The unsignalized
intersections on US 30 operate poorly for side street traffic, due to the difficulty in turning left against
the high traffic volumes on US 30. Two of the signalized intersections have relatively little delay (LOS B),
even though they exceed ODOT's v/c standard, and the US 30/Havlik intersection operates near
capacity. While the US 30/Old Portland Road (North) intersection operates at LOS F for the minor street
approach, a relatively low volume of traffic uses this approach, so the v/c ratio is relatively good.
Vehicles using this approach can access US 30 via a signalized intersection at Havlik Drive; however, that
intersection is approximately one-half mile away.

All intersections in Scappoose that are not on Highway 30 operate above mobility targets (LOS A or LOS
B), with correspondingly low v/c ratios. Field observations and traffic count data indicate a relatively
high volume of traffic traveling southbound on US 30 during the morning peak period and northbound
during the evening peak period. However, since the traffic flow is fairly directional, coordinated traffic
signal timing facilitates the progression of traffic through town. Therefore, delays are relatively minor
and queues typically clear during each signal cycle.

Average weekday intersection operations (shown in Table 14) are generally better than the peak
seasonal operations at all intersections reviewed, and two intersections that do not meet ODOT's
mobility targets during peak seasonal operations do meet the targets during the average weekday peak
(US 30/Maple St. and US 30/E.M. Watts Rd.). The conclusions do not change for any of the remaining

Intersection Geometrics
Several roadways and intersections in Scappoose do not provide optimal geometrics, which results in
user discomfort and potential safety issues. These include:
                                                    th
        Curves on Roadways: The alignment of SE 6 Street north of Vine Street has a horizontal curve with no
                                                                  th
        advanced warning signs provided. The alignment of SW 4 Street south of J.P. West Road has a sharp
        horizontal curve that limits user sight distance; advanced warning signs are provided.

        Skewed Intersections: The E.M. Watts Road/Keys Road/Eggleston Lane intersection is skewed with
        horizontal and vertical curves, a residential driveway within the intersection, and unclear intersection
                           th
        control. The SW 4 Street approaches at E.M. Watts Road are offset approximately 30 feet; the north leg
                                                                                    th
        of the intersection aligns with a residential driveway. The Elm Street/SE 6 Street intersection is skewed
        and has two residential driveways within the intersection. The Old Portland Road/Dutch Canyon Road
        intersection is skewed with an unimproved east leg. J.P. West Road at Keys Road is skewed and has a
        horizontal curve that limits sight distance. The West Lane Road/Wikstrom Road approaches at US 30 are
        offset approximately 100 feet. Several other intersections in the City are also skewed.

Roadway Connectivity
Applying typical roadway connectivity guidelines, Scappoose should have at least one north-south
collector roadway on each side of US 30 and about four east-west collector routes.

Currently, there are a number of constraints that limit connectivity in Scappoose. The street system has
numerous short streets with offset intersections on both the west and east sides of town. The creeks on
the west side and in the northeast area of town, as well as the steep topography on the west side of
town, limit east-west crossing opportunities. There are a lack of stub streets (constructed as cul-de-sacs
instead) that would allow future street connections.

These constraints contribute to a lack of continuous north-south and east-west connectivity to both the
east and west of US 30. This connectivity is important for improving circulation in town and to limit use
of US 30 to longer, through trips, which is its intended function.

Access Spacing
An access inventory was conducted along Highway 30 within the Scappoose city limits, in which the
number of existing approaches (driveways and public streets) was compared to the applicable ODOT
spacing standard. Table 15 shows the number of existing approaches for each segment of Highway 30
and compares it to the approximate number of driveway or public street approaches that would be
allowed under full compliance with the spacing standards. As shown, the east side of Highway 30 meets
access spacing standards for all segments, mainly because the railroad runs parallel to Highway 30,
making access more difficult to the east. However, all segments on the west side of Highway 30 have
more accesses than are allowed based on ODOT spacing standards. The portion of US 30 that is
particularly access-dense (more than double the recommended driveways) is from J.P. West Road to
Maple Street. It is expected that, as properties along US 30 are redeveloped, accesses will be removed
or consolidated in order to move toward the standard through coordination with ODOT.

Summary of Existing Deficiencies
Several existing transportation system gaps and deficiencies in Scappoose were described in the
previous sections and are summarized here:
        Barriers that restrict system connectivity for all modes: US 30 through the middle of town, the P&W rail
        line just east of US 30, the steep topography to the west of town, and Scappoose Creek.

Key transportation system gaps for pedestrians:
        Lack of sidewalks and enhanced pedestrian crossings along portions of US 30

        Lack of sidewalks on at least one side of Collectors to connect community destinations

        Gaps in the sidewalk network near bus stops

        Lack of sidewalks along routes to parks and schools

Key transportation system gaps for bicyclists:
        Lack of bike lanes or sufficient shoulders to provide an alternative to cycling on US 30

        Lack of bike lanes or sufficient shoulders on collectors to connect community destinations

        Limited bicycle parking near destinations

        Lack of bicycle wayfinding signage and shared-lane pavement markings

Key transportation system gaps for transit users:
        No bus stops with shelters and other amenities
                                                                                    st
        Lack of pedestrian crossings near primary bus stop and park and ride on 1 Street between Columbia
        Avenue and Prairie Street

        Lack of transit service

Key transportation system issues for drivers:
        Over the past three years, US 30 in Scappoose has crash rate higher than comparable facilities.

        US 30/Bonneville Drive/Johnsons Landing Road and US 30/West Lane Road intersections exceed ODOT
        mobility targets during the average weekday and the seasonal peak.

        The number of driveways on US 30 exceeds ODOT standards, with two to four times the recommended
        number of driveways.

        Several intersections and roadways have geometric deficiencies and sight distance limitations.

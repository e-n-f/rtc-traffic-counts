SCORE Jail Project Traffic Impact Analysis




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
   The proposed project will build a new freestanding jail facility south of South 208th Street in the City of
   Des Moines, Washington. The project will add 830 beds and a small administrative office. The facility,
   operated by an organization known as the South Correctional Entity (SCORE), will serve the following
   seven cities in south King County: Auburn, Burien, Des Moines, Federal Way, Renton, SeaTac, and
   Tukwila. The facility will be constructed in two phases, with the first phase open in 2011 and the
   second phase by 2015. For this study 2015 is the analysis year. Although 126 employees would be
   employed, 100 employees are expected to be working at the site during any given weekday:

       ·   A total of 80 correctional officers would work with two 12-hour shifts

       ·   An additional 20 administrative staff would work 8-hour days

   Four intersections within the City of SeaTac were analyzed as part of this study: South 200th
   Street/Des Moines Memorial Drive

       ·   South 200th Street/18th Avenue South

       ·   South 200th Street/26th Avenue South

       ·   South 200th Street/International Boulevard

EXISTING CONDITIONS
   Currently (2009), three of these signalized intersections operate at an acceptable level of service
   (LOS) standard as adopted by the City of SeaTac. The unsignalized intersection, South 200th
   Street/18th Avenue South, operates at LOS F (the southbound left turn movement) during the PM peak
   hour.

PROJECT INTERSECTION IMPACTS
   Our analysis shows that all study intersections would operate at the same LOS as the 2009 existing
   conditions. No intersection impacts are created with the addition of project-related traffic.

TRANSIT, BICYCLE, AND PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM ­ PROJECT IMPACTS
   No impacts were found to the transit, bicycle, and pedestrian systems in the project vicinity.

SCORE Jail Project Traffic Impact Analysis




1. INTRODUCTION
   This report documents the results of a study evaluating potential traffic impacts for the jail facility
   proposed by the South Correctional Entity (SCORE). This chapter describes the project, the study
   area, and the analysis methodology.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
   SCORE has proposed construction of a new jail facility to be located within the City of Des Moines,
   just south of the northern city boundary with the City of SeaTac. SCORE is an entity created to serve
   the following seven cities in south King County: Auburn, Burien, Des Monies, Federal Way, Renton,
   SeaTac, and Tukwila. The proposed project would accept misdemeanor prisoners serving sentences
   for crimes with maximum sentence of one year.
   The proposed facility includes 830 beds and an administrative office in a free-standing building. Access to
   the facility will be through the existing driveway in the alignment of 18th Avenue South from South 200th
   Street. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the proposed SCORE Jail Facility site in relation to the
   surrounding street system. The project site is located about a half mile west of International Boulevard
   (SR 99), less than one mile west of I-5, approximately a half mile east of Des Moines Memorial Drive, and
   about one mile south of the SeaTac Airport. The existing site is a wooded area owned by the Port of
   Seattle.

STUDY AREA
   The study analyzed the potential project-generated traffic impacts on the streets surrounding and
   serving the project. The projected completion year is estimated to be 2015 for Phases I and II. The
   cities of SeaTac and Des Moines decided that the traffic impact analysis should be carried out for the
   2015 planning horizon. The impact analysis examined the future conditions both with and without the
   proposed project. The existing condition with the proposed project was also examined. Three traffic
   scenarios were analyzed:

       ·   Existing Conditions (2009) ­ The analysis of existing traffic conditions provided a basis for the
           remainder of the study. The existing conditions analysis included an assessment of streets,
           traffic volumes, operating conditions, and transit services.

       ·   Base Conditions (No Project 2015) ­ This scenario projects the future traffic growth and
           operating conditions expected from regional growth and related projects in the vicinity of the
           project site, without consideration of the proposed project.

       ·   Base plus Project Conditions (2015) ­ The objective of this scenario was to identify the traffic
           impacts of the proposed project on future traffic operating conditions. The project traffic was
           added to the base traffic forecast.
   The study analyzed the traffic impacts along the major roads in the vicinity of the project site and included
   peak hour street segment and intersection level of service analyses at four locations (see Figure 1):

       ·   South 200th Street/Des Moines Memorial Drive

       ·   South 200th Street/18th Avenue South

       ·   South 200th Street/26th Avenue South

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
   This section discusses the methodology used to analyze traffic operations with the proposed facility.
   Key input and assumptions, LOS definitions, LOS criteria for roadways and intersections, and
   evaluation criteria are described.
   Key Inputs and Assumptions
   The key inputs and assumptions used in the traffic analysis include:

       ·   The PM peak hour was established based on the traffic characteristics of operating conditions
           on South 200th Street. Because PM peak hour traffic levels are higher than the AM peak hour,
           the study did not include the AM peak hour analysis.

       ·   The trip distribution for this facility was similar to the trip distribution of the travel demand
           model used for the City of Des Moines Transportation Plan update.

       ·   The cities of SeaTac and Des Moines would accept the use of the traffic operations analysis
           for study intersections using the procedures and methodologies contained in the Highway
           Capacity Manual (HCM 2000) (Transportation Research Board, 2000).

       ·   The traffic on South 200th Street without the project would grow at a rate of one percent per
           year from 2009 to 2015. A traffic model was not used to project traffic growth.
   Level of Service Definitions
   Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to describe the condition of traffic flow, ranging
   from excellent conditions at LOS A to overloaded conditions at LOS F. Since the four study
   intersections are located in the City of SeaTac, the SeaTac standard of LOS E along South 200th
   Street was applied in this study as the minimum acceptable LOS. The City of SeaTac Transportation
   Element of the City's Comprehensive Plan exempts applications from the LOS E policy for the South
   200th Street/International Boulevard intersection. Level of service definition based on intersection
   average delay per vehicle in seconds is shown in Table 1.

   Intersection Analysis Methodology
   Three of the analyzed intersections ­ South 200th Street/Des Moines Memorial Drive, South 200th
   Street/26th Avenue South and South 200th Street/International Boulevard ­ are controlled by traffic
   signals. The other intersection ­ South 200th Street/18th Avenue South ­ is an unsignalized
   intersection. For this study, both types of intersections were evaluated with Synchro (Version 6, Build
   614) software. For the unsignalized intersections, the stop controlled movement delays (northbound
   and southbound approaches at the 18th Avenue South/South 200th Street intersection) were reported
   in this report.
   The City of SeaTac has established LOS E as the minimum acceptable threshold for intersections on
   South 200th Street. The City of SeaTac exempts applications of the LOS E policy at the South 200th
   Street/International Boulevard intersection.
   In addition to vehicular impacts, potential impacts of the project were briefly evaluated on transit,
   bicycles, and pedestrians. Even though the proposed project is in a suburban area, no transit service
   on South 200th Street is provided. Visitors or employees are unlikely to ride a bicycle or walk to and
   from this facility. Therefore, we did not evaluate the project's effect on those modes.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
   This chapter describes the existing street network in the project vicinity, including operations at the
   study intersections and streets.

EXISTING ROADWAY FACILITIES
   Access to the proposed site is provided by the long driveway (18th Avenue South) that connects with
   South 200th Street. All vehicles accessing the proposed site must use South 200th Street and enter
   onto this driveway. South 200th Street is a major arterial connecting to International Boulevard (SR 99)
   and I-5 and is classified as a Principal Arterial by the City of SeaTac. It is a two-lane roadway.
   Diagrams of the existing lane configurations and traffic controls at the analyzed intersections are
   shown in Figure 2.

BICYCLE/PEDESTRIAN NETWORK
   No existing or planned bicycle and pedestrian facilities are in the study area. Sidewalks are provided
   on South 200th Street from 500 feet west of 26th Avenue South to International Boulevard and on 26th
   Avenue South and International Boulevard.

TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTION
   Turning movement counts at three intersections ­ South 200th Street/Des Moines Memorial Drive,
   South 200th Street/26th Avenue South and South 200th Street/International Boulevard ­ were collected
   in May 2008. Turning movement counts at South 200th Street/18th Avenue South intersection were
   collected on March 5, 2009. A one percent growth rate was applied to the 2008 counts to bring them
   to 2009. Intersection counts include two hours of traffic volume from 4:00 to 6:00 PM. The peak hour
   occurred from 4:15 to 5:15 PM. Existing weekday PM peak hour volumes at the study intersections are
   illustrated in Figure 3 and the traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix A. The counts
   shown in Appendix A are 2008 raw counts. To be conservative, we balanced the counts for continuity
   between the intersections along South 200th Street to correct for variations between the adjacent
   intersections. Therefore, the 2009 volumes shown in Figure 3 are higher than the counts shown in
   Appendix A.

EXISTING INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
    The existing weekday peak hour turning movement volumes shown in Figure 3 were used in conjunction
    with the LOS methodologies described previously to determine existing operating conditions at each
    study intersection. Detailed LOS calculation worksheets are included in Appendix B.
    Table 2 summarizes the existing LOS at each of the analyzed intersections during the PM peak hour.
    Three of the analyzed intersections currently operate at LOS E or better during the time period. The
    southbound approach on 18th Avenue South at the unsignalized intersection of South 200th Street/18th
    Avenue South operates at LOS F. At this location, the northbound approach operates at LOS B. The
    2009 intersection LOS and delay are also illustrated in Figure 4.

3. FUTURE BASELINE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
   This chapter describes the future traffic projections and operations at the study intersections and
   streets.

ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
   No arterial roadway capacity improvements are planned for South 200th Street. The City of SeaTac
   has a planned intersection improvement at the intersection of South 200th Street at Des Moines
   Memorial Drive. The improvements include left turn pockets for all approaches, a right turn lane for the
   east leg, and improvement of the signal in partnership with the City of Des Moines. Washington State
   Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has planned improvements for SR 509 extending and
   connecting it to I-5 by building new freeway lanes. This project is currently not funded. If the SR 509
   project were to be completed in the future, the traffic demand on South 200th Street would be reduced.

FUTURE BASE TRAFFIC PROJECTION
   The forecasts of future traffic conditions without the proposed project reflect traffic increases due to
   general regional growth in the project vicinity. These conditions are referred to as the base condition
   (i.e., no project conditions). The base traffic projections include growth in the existing background
   traffic volumes reflecting the effect of overall regional growth and development in and around the study
   area, referred to as ambient growth.
   A background annual traffic growth factor of 1.0 percent (for the six-year period from 2009 to 2015)
   was applied to existing traffic volumes at each of the analyzed locations to represent the traffic growth
   in the study area.
   The base traffic volumes, representing future conditions without the project for year 2015, are
   presented in Figure 5. These future projections take into account the estimated overall growth in the
   surrounding area.

FUTURE BASE INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
    The projected future 2015 Base PM peak hour turning movements depicted in Figure 5 were used in
    conjunction with the LOS methodologies described previously to determine the future operating
    conditions at each study intersection without considering the SCORE project. Detailed LOS calculation
    worksheets are included in Appendix B.
    Table 3 summarizes the 2015 Base LOS at each of the analyzed intersections during the PM peak
    hour. Three of the analyzed intersections would operate at LOS E or better during the analyzed time
    period in 2015. The southbound approach at the unsignalized intersection, South 200th Street/18th
    Avenue South, would continue to operate at LOS F in 2015, and the northbound approach would
    operate at LOS B. The 2015 Base intersection LOS and delay are also illustrated in Figure 6. We
    have included the level of service analysis reports in Appendix C.

4. PROJECT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
   This section develops the future traffic projections used to estimate the impact of the project. The
   three-step process included estimating project trip generation, trip distribution, and trip assignment.

TRIP GENERATION FACTORS
   The proposed SCORE Jail Facility will operate considerably differently from a typical jail or prison
   facility. The following describes the differences between the SCORE Jail Facility and a typical jail
   facility described by the Regional Jail trip generation data.
   Employee Traffic
   The staffing model for the SCORE facility is 6 to 1 (inmates to staff). A traditional jail's staffing model,
   based on the regional jail data, is around 3 to 1. Based upon the staffing model, when the facility is at
   full operations with 830 inmates, the total staffing needed to support the facility would be 135. To be
   conservative, we assumed 40 correctional officers per shift, with four 12-hour shifts per week. In
   addition, the facility would employ up to 20 administrative support staff who would work standard
   business hours.
   A total of 100 weekday employees would have the following shift distribution:

       ·   40 custodial employees during the first shift (7:00 AM - 7:00 PM)

       ·   40 custodial employees during the second shift (7:00 PM - 7:00 AM)

       ·   20 administrative employees (8:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
   Estimates of potential trips generated by these employees would be substantially lower than a typical
   jail, for the following reasons:

       ·   All correctional officers would arrive before the beginning the shift time and leave after their
           work is completed (i.e., two person trips per employee per day). No correctional officers would
           arrive or depart during AM and PM peak hours.

       ·   Administrative employees would have a typical office employee working time profile.

       ·   All employees would arrive to the site individually by car.

       ·   Uniformed staff is not allowed to leave the facility during their shift. No staff would leave the
           site except during shift changes or on official business.
   Booking Trips
   The SCORE facility will provide transport officers to pick up arrestees at the arresting agencies. The
   transport officers will drive a prescribed route that visits the owner agencies and will be able to
   transport multiple arrestees at one time, reducing the volume of vehicle trips to SCORE.
   Court Visit Trips
   Court hearings will be conducted via video link. This technology will drastically lower or eliminate
   transfer trips to and from the jail facility. Any trips that do occur are not likely to coincide with either the
   AM or PM peak hours.



                                                                                                        May 2009
                                                                                                               15
SCORE Jail Project Traffic Impact Analysis




   Attorney/Business Trips
   Attorneys will be able to use video connections to discuss with inmates. The video link can happen at
   any computer that has an Internet camera and may dramatically reduce the number of daily trips by
   attorneys to and from the site.
   Visitor Trips
   Inmate visiting will be conducted via video connection either on-site or off-site, lowering the incentive
   for on-site visitor trips. No "in-person" visits will occur on-site. Visitors to the facility must pre-schedule
   their visits, and they cannot visit during peak hours, which coincide with meal times within the facility.
   Delivery and Service Vehicles
   Most delivery trips will be scheduled for arriving and departing the site outside of peak hours.

ITE TRIP GENERATION
   We consulted available data sources such as the ITE Trip Generation 7th Edition and other available
   studies in an effort to find information for a similar project. The ITE manual has data on the Prison
   (571) land use, which is based on two studies that use the number of beds and the number of
   employees as the independent variables. The studies present a wide range of rates, with a smaller-
   sized facility (50 employee) having much higher trip rates than the larger-facility (320 employee).
   Similarly, little correlation exists between the reported rates based on the number of beds, with the
   average trip generation per bed for a 200-bed facility at 10 times the rate as a 500-bed facility. The ITE
   manual does not include trip generation rates for total daily (weekday) trips and lacks rates for the AM
   and PM Peak Hour of the Generator with beds as the independent variable. We feel this data is of
   limited use because of the differences between jail and prison facilities and the variation in the rates.
   We found improved trip generation data from a study published in the Journal of Urban Planning and
   Development (March 2000), which included trip generation studies of five regional jails in West Virginia
   that are similar in function (misdemeanor crime facilities) and size. A copy of the report is included in
   Appendix D. The article distinguishes between jail facilities and prison facilities in terms of the use for
   trip generation purposes. The article notes that visitor policies are the most important factor in trip
   generation and that appropriate adjustments should be made to reflect conditions with respect to
   facility type, size, and visitation policies. Table 4 compares the ITE trip generation data and the
   Regional Jail data. Based on our review, we will use the Regional Data as the basis for determining
   the trip generation.

    Proposed Trip Generation
    Based upon these actions, we believe that the shift changes, video data link technology, and
    operational controls will result in a dramatically lower impact to the project. We estimate that trip
    generation from the site will be 75 to 80 percent lower than a typical jail facility.
    To provide an extremely conservative analysis, we are assuming the PM peak hour trip generation
    consistent with the data from the Regional Jail study using the higher of the trip generation rates
    (beds). Therefore, a total of 83 PM peak hour trips would be generated by the development during the
    PM peak hour. Table 5 shows trip generation for the weekday, AM and PM peak hours of the
    generator, and AM and PM peak hours of the adjacent street traffic based upon the number of beds.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION
   A trip distribution pattern was developed based on traveling to and from the seven member cities of
   Auburn, Renton, Des Moines, Federal Way, SeaTac, Burien, and Tukwila and general traffic pattern at
   the study intersections. Using this data, the directional distribution patterns for entering and exiting
   trips are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.

TRIP ASSIGNMENT
   Project trips were assigned to the study intersections and roadways in accordance with the trip
   distribution percentages and roadway network.

SCORE Jail Project Traffic Impact Analysis




5. FUTURE 2015 WITH PROJECT TRAFFIC
    This chapter presents an analysis of the projected opening year 2015 base plus project traffic volumes
    to determine the potential project-specific impacts of the proposed project.

INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
    Figure 9 illustrates PM peak hour traffic volumes at each of the four study intersections in 2015 with
    the project. Table 6 summarizes the intersection operations with the proposed project for the planning
    horizon year of 2015. All phases of the construction are expected to be complete and all planned
    facilities open by 2015.
    Three of the analyzed intersections currently operate at LOS E or better during the analyzed time
    period. The unsignalized intersection, South 200th Street/18th Avenue South, operates at LOS F on the
    southbound approach and at LOS E on the northbound approach. Figure 10 illustrates the
    intersection LOS and delay. Appendix E contains the detailed level of service reports.

PROJECT IMPACTS
    The intersection analysis indicates that operations would degrade at South 200th Street/18th Avenue
    South during the PM peak hour with the addition of project traffic. This intersection's level of service
    issue primarily relates to the southbound left turn movement. This project would not add trips to this
    movement. Based on our analysis, the intersection of South 200th Street/18th Avenue South will
    require mitigation.

6. TRANSIT, BICYCLE, AND PEDESTRIAN SYSTEMS ­ PROJECT IMPACTS
   This chapter discusses impacts related to the transit, bicycle, and pedestrian system. Potential
   impacts include disruptions to existing transit service; interference with planned transit facilities;
   conflicts with adopted transit system plans, guidelines, policies, or standards; and creation of demand
   for public transit above the available capacity.

TRANSIT SYSTEM PROJECT IMPACTS
   The project is in a suburban area with no transit routes on South 200th Street and little or no
   anticipated transit riders from the project.
   The project would not adversely affect the transit system. Therefore, the impact of the project is not
   significant.

BICYCLE SYSTEM PROJECT IMPACTS
   The project vicinity has no bicycle facilities, and no bicycle activity is expected from the project.
   The project's impact is not significant.

PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM PROJECT IMPACTS
   The project vicinity has no pedestrian facilities, and no pedestrian activity is expected around the
   project site. The impact of the project on pedestrian movements is not significant.

7. MITIGATION ACTIONS
    The following measures are suggested to mitigate the impacts of the SCORE Jail Facility.

OPERATIONAL MITIGATION
    The SCORE Jail Facility is a modern example of a correctional institution that will not generate as
    many trips as projected in this study, which assumes the operation of a traditional jail facility. We
    believe the actual trip generation during the AM and PM peak hours will be only 25 to 50 percent of
    the values used in this conservative analysis. To achieve this low trip generation, we suggest the
    following as mitigation:

         ·    Operation of shift changes outside of the 4:00 - 6:00 PM peak hour.

         ·    Strict scheduling of visitor trips.

         ·    Provision of inmate visitation, court proceedings via video connection.

         ·    Scheduling of deliveries outside of peak hours.

         ·    Ability to transport multiple arrestees to reduce individual booking trips.

IMPACT FEES
    The SCORE Jail Facility will provide transportation impact fees based on the number of PM peak hour
    trips, as required by Section 12.56 of the Des Moines Municipal Code. Because the analysis
    represents a worst-case scenario, we recommend that the City consider the operational aspects of the
    SCORE Jail Facility that will lower the traffic impact of the facility. A credit for fees should be applied
    for eligible off-site improvements funded or completed by SCORE.

MITIGATION FOR 18TH AVENUE SOUTH AND SOUTH 200TH STREET
    The southbound movement at this intersection has an existing LOS F condition during the PM peak
    hour. We suggest a two-way left turn lane be constructed by the development to improve the operation
    of the intersection and to provide left turn storage during shift changes for inbound traffic. This would
    also serve as a refuge lane for southbound left turning volumes, allowing vehicles to make a two-stage
    left turn. The northbound driveway access would improve from LOS E to LOS C with the improvement.
    Table 7 summarizes the intersection operations with the proposed project for the planning horizon
    year of 2015 with the proposed mitigation at the intersection of 18th Avenue South and South 200th
    Street.

8. PARKING ANALYSIS
   A parking analysis was conducted to estimate the number of parking spaces required at this facility
   based upon the demand for parking facilities. A copy of the parking demand model is included in
   Appendix F. The SCORE Jail Facility plans to have two parking lots. One lot will be exclusively for
   employees; the other lot will provide parking stalls for other trips.

EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT
   The correctional officers will have 12-hour shifts daily, changing at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Each shift
   will employ 40 correctional officers. Since their shifts will overlap for 15 to 30 minutes, the facility will
   need at least 80 parking stalls in the employee lot.
   The 20 administrative employees will arrive after the AM shift change of correctional officers and leave
   before the PM shift change at 7:00 PM. The administrative employees will have 40 available parking
   stalls between 7:30 AM and 6:30 PM. The SCORE facility must provide a minimum of 80 parking
   spaces to accommodate the highest employee demand.

NON-EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT
   The second parking lot will accommodate non-employee parking needs. Using a number of
   conservative assumptions, we estimated a peak demand of 479 non-employee trips per day. Of these,
   400 trips are generated by visitors, and 79 trips are generated by bookings, court visits,
   attorney/business, and delivery trips. We developed a separate parking demand model for visitor and
   other non-employee trips with the assumptions that these trips will follow two different hourly
   distributions of parking demand. We assumed that the average duration of the visitor trips will be 25
   minutes and the other non-employee trips will be 45 minutes. The highest demand for visitor parking of
   30 stalls will occur between 1:15 PM and 3:00 PM. During the same time period, the highest demand
   of nine stalls will occur for the other non-employee parking stalls. The SCORE facility must provide a
   minimum of 39 parking stalls to meet the highest demand for non-employee parking needs, including
   visitors.

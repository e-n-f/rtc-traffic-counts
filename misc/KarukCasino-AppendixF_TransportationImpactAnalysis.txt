Executive Summary




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Proposed Development Plan
The Karuk Casino project is a 800 gaming position casino and 80 room hotel development on the north
side of Sharps Road, east of Fairlane Road in the City of Yreka. Phase 1 of the project consists of a 500
gaming position (14,200 square feet) casino. Phase 2 (total project) would add an additional 300 gaming
positions (9,500 square feet) to the casino, for a total of 800 gaming positions or 23,700 square feet, as
well as an 80 room hotel.


Trip Generation
Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition (commonly referred
to as the ITE Trip Generation Manual), combined with trip generation studies of previous, similar casino
projects, the project descriptions for the Karuk Casino generate a maximum of 159 PM peak hour trips
and 1,689 daily trips.

The project’s traffic impacts were estimated by considering the amount of traffic to be generated by
the project and the direction distribution of that traffic. Only the PM peak hour was analyzed for this
project because a casino generates most of its weekday trips during the PM peak hour.


FINDINGS

Existing No Project Conditions
All study intersections were found to be operating at a satisfactory level of service based on the
applicable standards.


Existing Plus Project Phase 1 Conditions
With the addition of project traffic from Phase 1,

          All study intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily per the applicable standards.
Based on the City of Yreka General Plan1 and Caltrans Traffic Impact Study Guidelines2, no impacts are
considered significant.

    Executive Summary


    Existing Plus Project Phase 2 Conditions
    With the addition of project traffic from Phase 2 (total build out including Phase 1),

            All study intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily per the applicable standards.
    No impacts were found to be significant.


    Cumulative (2030) No Project Conditions
    Using the historic annual growth rate from the previous decade from Caltrans Traffic Count database,
    existing PM peak hour turning movement volumes at the study intersections were increased to turning
    movement volumes in the cumulative (2030) year.

    In summary, in the Cumulative (2030) No Project scenario,

            The I-5 Northbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks Avenue intersection is expected to perform below
             the applicable level of service standards.
            All other intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily.


    Cumulative (2030) Plus Ultimate Build-out of Project Conditions
    With the addition of project traffic,

            The I-5 Northbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks Avenue intersection is expected to perform below
             the applicable level of service standards.
            All other intersections are expected to perform satisfactorily.
            The project’s impact was found to be significant at the I-5 Northbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks
             intersection. Mitigation measure to reduce the project’s impact to less than significant is
             summarized in Table 1.

Executive Summary


Aside from the proposed mitigation, it’s recommended that improvements be made to Sharps Road, at
a minimum in the vicinity of the project site, providing curbs, gutters, and sidewalks with pedestrian
access into the proposed casino. Similar improvements can be found along the short stretch of Sharps
Road on the opposite side of the project.

Introduction




INTRODUCTION

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Karuk Casino project is a 800 gaming position casino and 80 room hotel development on the north
side of Sharps Road, east of Fairlane Road in the City of Yreka. Phase 1 of the project consists of a 500
gaming position (14,200 square feet) casino. Phase 2 (total build out) would add 300 gaming positions
(9,500 square feet) to the casino, for a total of 800 gaming positions or 23,700 square feet, as well as an
80 room hotel.


STUDY AREA
Existing and future overall peak hour traffic conditions were evaluated at seven intersections that
would most likely be impacted by the project. The following locations were studied:

          1.   South Main Street/Fort Jones Road and Oberlin Road
          2.   Fairlane Road and Oberlin Road
          3.   Campbell Avenue and Oberlin Road
          4.   I-5 Southbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks Avenue
          5.   I-5 Northbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks Avenue
          6.   Fairlane Road and Moonlit Oaks Avenue
          7.   Fairlane Road and Sharps Road

In summary, the study includes an analysis of seven intersections in the vicinity of the project site. The
study intersections were evaluated against the standards set forth by the City of Yreka and Caltrans.

Traffic conditions at the intersections were analyzed for the weekday PM peak hours of traffic. The PM
peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM.

Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:

Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from recent traffic counts.

Scenario 2:    Existing Plus Project Conditions. Project generated traffic volumes were added to the
               Existing traffic volumes. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative to
               existing conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

Scenario 3:    Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative Conditions traffic volumes were developed using the
               historical growth rate from the previous decade based on Caltrans traffic data.

Introduction


Scenario 4:    Cumulative Plus Project Conditions. Project generated traffic volumes were added to the
               cumulative traffic volumes. Cumulative plus project conditions were evaluated relative
               to cumulative conditions in order to determine potential cumulative project impacts.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the key intersections within the study area. These conditions will be compared with
future conditions later in this report.


TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES

Roadway Facilities
The existing traffic lane configurations and traffic controls at the key intersections are shown in Figure
2. The following is a description of the roadway network in the vicinity of the project:

Interstate 5 (I-5) is an interstate freeway that traverses in the north-south direction, providing intercity
connection to the north and south of the City of Yreka. Interstate 5 has two 12-foot travel lanes in each
direction with 10-foot shoulders at the interchange in the vicinity of the project site. The facility would
provide intercity access to the proposed traffic from the north and south. The speed limit along
Interstate-5 is posted at 65 miles per hour (mph).

Fairlane Road is a collector that begins at Oberlin Road and continues south into the County of Siskiyou
where it terminates at Running Bear Road. Fairlane Road has two 12-foot travel lanes with 10-foot
paved shoulders in the vicinity of the project site. The speed limit along Fairlane Road is posted at 45
mph. The facility lacks curbs, gutters, and sidewalks along portions of the facility in the vicinity of the
project site.

Oberlin Road is an arterial that traverses in the east-west direction, providing connection between
Kegler Lane and Montague Grenada Road. Oberlin Road has two 12-foot travel lanes with 8-foot paved
shoulders in the vicinity of the project site. The speed limit along Oberlin Road is posted at 35 mph in
the vicinity of the project site.

Sharps Road is a local roadway, running in the east-west direction from Fairlane Road to the project
site. Sharps Road has two 12-foot travel lanes with no paved shoulders in the vicinity of the project site.
The facility would provide access to the proposed project via a full access project driveway. The speed
limit along Sharps Road is unposted and the facility lacks curbs, gutters, and sidewalks along most of its
length with the exception of a short segment across from the project site. Surrounding land uses
include mostly empty lots, a large portion of which south of Sharps Road is used for the Siskiyou County
Fairgrounds. There is also an R.V. Park to the north of Sharps Road and some scattered industrial uses.

Moonlit Oaks Avenue is an arterial/local roadway, running east-west from Campus Drive to Fairlane
Road. Moonlit Oaks Avenue has two 15-foot travel lanes with 5-foot paved shoulders in the vicinity of
the project area. The facility is at the location of the interchange with Interstate 5 that would provide
intercity access to the project site. The speed limit along Moonlit Oaks Avenue is unposted and the


                                                       17                               Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

Existing Conditions


facility lacks curbs, gutters, and sidewalks except on both approaches to the Moonlit Oaks Avenue and
Main Street signalized intersection.


Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Fairlane Road is the only currently-designated bicycle route in the City of Yreka. However, Class II
bicycle lanes are not present in the vicinity of the project area. The area also generally lacks curbs,
gutters, and sidewalks with the exceptions noted above. Additionally, Oberlin Road and Moonlit Oaks
Avenue are designated as bicycle routes in the City of Yreka’s General Plan.


Transit Facilities
Local transit service is provided within the City of Yreka by the Siskiyou Transit and General Express
(STAGE) transit agency. However, there is not local transit service provided in the vicinity of the project
site.


EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND PEAK HOUR OPERATIONS
The existing traffic volume levels in the vicinity of the project were determined by collecting afternoon
peak hour turning movement counts at six of the seven study intersections. The lone exception is the
Sharps Road and Fairlane Road intersection which was not identified as a study intersection at the time
of the traffic counts. Traffic volumes at Sharps Road and Fairlane Road were inferred from nearby
counts at the Fairlane Road and Oberlin Road intersection to the north and the Fairlane Road and
Moonlit Oaks Road intersections to the south. The difference in approaching and departing volumes
were all attributed to the Sharps Road and Fairlane Road intersection’s inbound and outbound
movements. The traffic counts were collected during the afternoon (4:00PM – 6:00PM) peak hours on
June 20, 2013 when all of the local area schools were in session. Figure 3 shows the turning movement
counts as well as the existing geometries and controls at the study intersections.

LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODOLOGY
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative indication of the level of delay and congestion experienced by
motorists using an intersection. Levels of service are designated by the letters A through F, with A being
the best conditions and F being the worst (high delay and congestion). The City of Yreka considers LOS A
through C to be acceptable operating conditions for intersections within the City’s jurisdiction. Caltrans
considers LOS A through C to be acceptable operating conditions for state highway facilities.

The following intersections lie within the City of Yreka’s jurisdiction, and therefore, LOS C is acceptable
for these intersections:

          South Main Street/Fort Jones Road and Oberlin Road
          Fairlane Road and Oberlin Road
          Campbell Avenue and Oberlin Road
          Fairlane Road and Moonlit Oaks Avenue
          Fairlane Road and Sharps Road

The following intersections and roadway segments lie within the jurisdiction of Caltrans, and therefore,
LOS C is acceptable for these intersections:

          I-5 Southbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks Avenue
          I-5 Northbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks Avenue

The methods used for analysis are described below.


Signalized Intersection Analysis
All signalized intersections (those controlled by traffic signals) were analyzed using the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology. This procedure calculates an average stopped delay per
vehicle at a signalized intersection, and assigns a level of service designation based upon the delay.
Table 2 presents the HCM 2010 delay and level of service definitions. Optimized timings were assumed
for all scenarios.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
At an unsignalized intersection, most of the major street traffic is not delayed, and by definition have
acceptable conditions. The major street left-turn movements and the minor street movements are all
susceptible to delay of varying degrees. Generally, the higher the major street traffic volumes, the
higher the delay for the minor movements.

Two-Way Stop Controlled (TWSC) Intersection Analysis: Non-signalized TWSC intersection analyses
were conducted using the operational methodology outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual
(Transportation Research Board, Washington D.C., 2000). This procedure calculates an average stopped
delay per vehicle for each movement and assigns a level of service designation based upon the minor
leg’s worst movement average delay.

HCM 2010 definitions for delay and level of service at unsignalized intersections are presented in Table
3.

SIGNAL WARRANTS
Unsignalized intersections were evaluated using the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) in the
Caltrans Traffic Manual. Non-signalized intersections shown to trigger the peak hour signal warrant are
identified in this analysis for discussion purposes. However, the decision to install a traffic signal should
not be based solely upon a single warrant. The additional eight other warrants should be examined as
well.

Warrant 3 addresses peak hour traffic volume levels above which it is presumed that the need for a
traffic signal is warranted. Traffic signals tend to reduce the potential for right-angle type collisions but
also tend to increase the potential for less severe read-end collisions. Signal warrant peak hour volumes
represent the threshold point at which the potential for more rear-end collisions is offset by the
potential for fewer more severe right-angle collisions.

All unsignalized intersections were evaluated using total approach volumes. Where signal warrants
were met with total approach volume, right turn volumes were reduced if a dedicated right turn only

                                                                22                        Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

lane was present in accordance with the California MUTCD. A common approach to determining the
amount of the reduction involves subtracting 85% of the right turn lane’s capacity from the number of
right turns on the approach. If the result is less than or equal to zero, no right turns are included in the
warrant for that approach.


IMPACT SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

City of Yreka
According to the City of Yreka’s General Plan, the following are thresholds of significance, which are
used to determine if an impact is significant and requires mitigation.

For unsignalized and signalized intersections, a project is considered to have a significant effect if it
would:

          Result in a roadway or a signalized intersection operating at an acceptable LOS (A, B, or C) to
           deteriorate to an unacceptable LOS (D, E, or F)


Caltrans
Per Caltrans guidelines3, Caltrans endeavors to maintain a target LOS at the transition between LOS “C”
and LOS “D” on State highway facilities. However, Caltrans acknowledges that this may not always be
feasible and recommends that the lead agency consult with Caltrans to determine the appropriate
target LOS.

Existing Plus Project Conditions




EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
To develop the Existing Plus Project traffic conditions, the traffic generated by the proposed project is
added to the Existing traffic volumes. Existing Plus Project conditions are compared relative to the
Existing conditions to determine the potential impacts due to the proposed project.


Project Traffic
The project’s traffic impacts were estimated in this section by considering the amount of traffic to be
generated by the project and the directional distribution of that traffic. The project site is proposed to
have one access point toward the end of Sharps Road.


TRIP GENERATION
Generally, the ITE Trip Generation Manuals is the standard reference from which to determine trip
generation rates. However, the rates for a casino included in the latest edition of the ITE Trip
Generation Manual are based on surveys of six casino/video lottery establishments taken in South
Dakota in the 1990’s. The square footage of the surveyed facilities ranged from 600 to 2,400 square
feet. Based on preliminary calculations and a comparison of this rate with other studies, described
below, it was found that use of the ITE rate was inappropriate and produced results that did not
compare with the expected traffic of the Proposed Project. Instead, as described below, more recent
trip generation data available from surveys of existing tribal casinos were used to estimate the traffic
that would be produced by the casino portion of the Proposed Project for Phase 1 and 2.

The rates used in the weekday analysis are presented in Table 6. To determine the weekday trip
generation for the project, an analysis of the trip generation was conducted to relate the actual casino
square footage to the trips being generated. Data for this comparison was previously obtained from 24-
hour machine traffic counts conducted during the peak season at the Cache Creek Casino located in
Capay, California.4 Using this data it was determined that including the non-gaming areas in the
calculations results in a gross overstatement of the future casino trip generation. Therefore, the
additional trips from the casino portion of the Proposed Project were calculated based on the area of
the gaming floor and other space that would be accessible to patrons (excluding back of house,
administration, and employee areas).

The trip generation rates used in the Shingle Springs Rancheria Interchange Project
Transportation/Circulation Technical Study5 were based on survey data collected at five (5) northern

California Indian gaming casinos ranging in size from 17,300 square feet to 78,000 square feet. Inbound
and outbound traffic data was collected at each casino surveyed for a weekday AM peak hour, a
weekday PM peak hour, and the Saturday peak hour. The resulting traffic data was then converted to
trip generation data for use in the Shingle Springs document using a weighted average rate
methodology.

The use of the weighted average to establish trip rates is justified based on the following precedents:

      1. A similar methodology using a “weighted average” was used by Fehr and Peers within their
         traffic study for the Auburn Rancheria. A PM peak hour rate was established within that report
         by using a “weighted average” of PM peak hour rates at four northern California casinos.

         Edition” published in June of 2004 specifies that ITE rates are based on weighted averages and
         states: “The average rates presented in Trip Generation are weighted averages (weighted by the
         units of the independent variable).” The use of the weighted average rates is typically specified
         by ITE when there are less than 20 survey data points. When there are more than 20 data points
         (and the data has the desired level of coordination) then a regression equation may be used, if
         provided.

The hotel component base trip generation information was developed from the number of rooms
provided by the applicant using the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, Ninth
Edition, 2012. The rates for a standard hotel were used (ITE Land Use Code 310).

The San Diego County Department of Public Works prepared a study of casino trip generation entitled
“Report on the Potential Impacts of Tribal Gaming on Northern and Eastern San Diego County”. 6 Based
on surveys of numerous southern California Indian gaming casinos, the San Diego Report established
that when a hotel is part of a casino-hotel establishment the daily trip rate for the hotel is typically
around 3.0 trips per room rather than the typical 8.17 trips per room rate found in the ITE Trip
Generation manual. This is a 63.5% reduction in number of daily trips likely to be generated by a hotel
when the hotel is combined with a casino. This 63.5% reduction in trips was applied to the AM, PM, and
Saturday peak hour rates for a hotel. This is conservative compared to the 75% reduction that has been
used in other recent casino studies in Caltrans District 3 such as the Thunder Valley Casino Expansion
Project.7

Using these rates, during the normal weekday p.m. commute peak hour the Proposed Project is
estimated to generate a total of approximately 159 p.m. peak hour trips (76 inbound and 83 outbound).
The revised project descriptions for the two phases of the Karuk Casino generate a maximum of 1,689

Trip Distribution
To evaluate the traffic related effects of the project, trips that would be generated by the project were
distributed onto the roadway network. Trip distribution simulates the circulation pattern of travel, by
matching trips generated by one type of land use (e.g., residential) with trips generated by other types
of land uses (e.g., employment, shopping, and education). Trip distribution patterns to and from the
proposed project were estimated by evaluating the existing roadway network, existing travel patterns
from counts, nearby population centers of likely patrons for this proposed casino project, and current
land use patterns. Trip distribution patterns are shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 and Figure 6 present the
project’s turning movement volumes at the study intersections for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 scenarios,
respectively.

Existing Plus Project Conditions



LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Existing Plus Project intersection peak hour volumes for Phase 1 and Phase 2 were computed as the
sum of the Existing peak hour volumes and Project Only peak hour volumes for Phase 1 and Phase 2,
respectively. Figure 7 and Figure 8 present the peak hour volumes for each phase while Table 9 and
Table 10 present the level of service at study intersections under Existing Plus Project conditions for
Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively. No intersections are expected to perform below their level of service
standard for either the Phase 1 or Phase 2 conditions.

Cumulative No Project Conditions




YEAR 2030 CUMULATIVE NO PROJECT CONDITIONS
The cumulative condition, or the Cumulative (2030) No Project condition, is used as a future baseline to
compare against the Cumulative Plus Project condition. No roadway improvements or development
projects are scheduled to happen in the vicinity of the project according to conversations with the City
and research into the Regional Transportation Plan. This comparison identifies long-term project-
related impacts.


CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Due to the lack of a travel demand model that covers the City of Yreka, Caltrans’ historical traffic count
data was used to determine a historic growth rate in the vicinity of the project. The historic average
annual growth rate on Interstate 5 between Miner Street and State Route 3 during the peak hour in
both directions from 2001 to 2011 was calculated to be 0.41 percent. Existing PM peak hour turning
movement volumes at the study intersections were increased using this annual growth rate to estimate
the turning movement volumes in the cumulative (2030) year.

The Cumulative (2030) intersection lane configuration and control remained the same as under existing
conditions. PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections under Cumulative (No Project)
conditions are shown in Figure 9.

Cumulative Plus Project Conditions




YEAR 2030 CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
This section describes Cumulative Plus Project conditions. Cumulative Plus Project conditions are
defined as the addition of project traffic to the Cumulative No Project traffic volumes. The comparison
of Cumulative Plus Project conditions to Cumulative No Project conditions demonstrates project-related
impacts.


PROJECT TRAFFIC
Project traffic volumes were calculated using the same method discussed under the Existing Plus
Project conditions. Only Phase 2 (including both the 80 room hotel and 800 gaming positions) is
considered in the Cumulative (2030) Plus Project scenario.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Project generated traffic is added to the Cumulative No Project traffic volumes to obtain the Cumulative
Plus Project traffic volumes. Cumulative Plus Project peak hour traffic volumes are graphically shown in
Figure 10.

The California MUTCD Peak Hour Signal Warrant (#3) was used for the signal warrant analysis.



IMPACT DETERMINATION
The following study intersections were found to be operating unsatisfactorily and/or meeting the peak
hour signal warrant. A comparison of the project’s effect on traffic operations and the impact
significance criteria presented above yields the determinations presented below. Recommendations
and mitigations to improve operations to an acceptable level are presented in the Recommendations
and Mitigation Measures section.


I-5 Northbound Ramps and Moonlit Oaks Avenue
The operation of this intersection is expected to worsen to LOS D, an unacceptable LOS, in the
Cumulative scenario with the project. As a result, the impact is considered significant.

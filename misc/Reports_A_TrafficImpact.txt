Project:      A+O Apartments
Subject:      Traffic Impact Study


DBG Oak Street, LLC is proposing the development of up to 215 apartments immediately southeast of
the SW Oak Street/SW 90th Avenue intersection within the Washington Square Regional Center. Access
to the apartment complex will be provided via SW Oak Street. This report addresses the
redevelopment’s traffic impacts on the surrounding transportation system and considers the adequacy
of the proposed on-site circulation to safely and efficiently accommodate the anticipated site
operations.

No off-site capacity mitigation needs were identified through our review. However, the SW 90th Avenue
approach to SW Oak Street will need to be re-configured to accommodate a southbound through
movement into the proposed development. Specifically, it is recommended that the current
southbound left-turn lane on SW 90th Avenue be-restriped to serve as a shared through/left-turn lane.
In addition, a STOP sign should be installed on the new northbound driveway approach, as well as on
the northbound driveway approaches on the other two proposed accesses for consistency. The
approach re-striping and corresponding signage as well as the new northbound STOP signs should be
installed in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). In addition, sight
distance at the intersection could be furthered enhanced by trimming the trees at the northwest side
of the intersection and adding curbs and sidewalks to further define vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian
travel paths. We recommend that the A+O Apartments development team collaborate with the City of
Tigard regarding potential improvements to the intersection.

The study concludes that the proposed redevelopment can occur while maintaining acceptable traffic
operations and safety at the study intersections. Additional details of the methodology, findings and
recommendations are provided herein.

INTRODUCTION
The site vicinity of the proposed A+O Apartments development is shown in Figure 1. The site is
currently occupied by single family homes, with driveway access to SW Oak Street. The proposed
development would replace the existing single family homes with a 215 apartment complex.

Access to the development is proposed via three accesses on SW Oak Street. The west access will be
aligned with SW 90th Avenue. The center access will be approximately 200 feet east of this access. The
far east access will be approximately 300 feet east of the center access. All driveways are proposed to
allow full movements. Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual site plan and site-driveway locations.

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
All level of service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 1). A description of level of service and the
criteria by which they are determined is presented in Appendix A. Appendix A also indicates how level
of service is measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service.

Synchro7 software was used for all intersection operations, in accordance with the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual. Signal timing was provided by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and
Washington County for the signalized study intersections. Minor calibrations were made to the
Synchro7 model at the OR 217 Northbound Ramps/Greenburg Road to account for site-specific
conditions; details are provided in Appendix B.

To ensure that this analysis was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, the peak 15 minute flow
rate during the peak hour analysis periods was used in the evaluation of all intersection levels of
service. For this reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are only likely to occur for 15 minutes out
of each average peak hour. Traffic conditions during other weekday hours and throughout the
weekend will likely be better than those described in this report.


Operating Standards
ODOT intersection operating standards are identified in Section 1F1 and Table 7 the Oregon Highway
Plan (Reference 2). The standard for the OR 217 ramps is a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of 0.85 and
the standard for SW Oak Street/SW Hall Boulevard is a v/c ratio of 1.1.

City of Tigard intersection operating standards were identified by Mike McCarthy of the city staff. The
standard for the city intersections is a v/c ratio of 0.95 with no movements over capacity.


Queuing
Queuing analyses presented in this report were conducted using 95th percentile queue lengths
estimated by the Synchro7 software.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies site conditions and the current operational and geometric
characteristics of roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.

The site of the proposed development and surrounding study area was visited and inventoried in
March 2014. At that time, information was collected regarding site conditions, adjacent land uses,
existing traffic operations, and transportation facilities in the study area.

Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The A+O Apartments site is within City of Tigard limits and is zoned Mixed Use Residential 1 (MUR-1)
and Mixed Use Employment 1 (MUE-1). The site is currently occupied by single-family homes. The
property is bordered by SW Oak Street to the north and low density residential housing on the east and
west. OR 217 is located south of the site.

Transportation Facilities
Table 1 summarizes key roadway facilities serving the site and Figure 3 illustrates the existing lane
configurations and traffic control devices at the study intersections.

Transit Facilities
TriMet provides bus service in the local study area (Reference 4). Route 76, Beaverton/Tualatin,
operates along SW Greenburg Road in the study area and provides connections to Beaverton Transit
Center, Washington Square Transit Center, Tigard Transit Center, and Tualatin Park & Ride. Route 78,
Beaverton/Lake Oswego, also serves SW Greenburg Road and provides connections to Beaverton
Transit Center, Washington Square Transit Center, Tigard Transit Center, and Lake Oswego Transit
Center. Both routes operate daily.

Route 43, Taylors Ferry Road, provides weekday service on SW Hall Boulevard and connects downtown
Portland to the Washington Square Transit Center.

Existing Traffic Operations
Manual turning-movement counts were conducted at the study intersections in March 2014. The
counts were conducted on a typical mid-week day during the morning peak period (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.)
and the evening peak period (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) per City requirements. Intersection peak hours were
used to provide a conservative analysis.

Figures 4 and 5 provide a summary of the existing turning-movement counts, which are rounded to the
nearest five vehicles per hour for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively. Appendix C
contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.

As shown in Figures 4 and 5, each of the study intersections operates acceptably per the applicable
standards during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. During the weekday a.m. peak hour, all
intersections operate at a LOS “B” or better. During the weekday p.m. peak hour, all intersections
operate acceptably per applicable standards. Further, during the p.m. peak hour all study intersections
but the OR 217 ramp terminals operate at a LOS “B” or better. The northbound ramps/Greenburg Road
intersection operates at a LOS “D”; the southbound ramps/Greenburg Road intersection operates at a
LOS “C.” Both ramp intersections meet ODOT mobility standards.

Appendix D contains the existing conditions traffic operations worksheets.


TRAFFIC SAFETY
Washington County maintains a Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) list to identify existing hazardous
intersections for potential safety improvements. Intersections are included in the SPIS list if they have
three or more crashes or if they have one or more severe injury or fatal crashes within three
consecutive years. The intersection of SW Oak Street/SW Hall Boulevard appears on the most recent
Washington County SPIS list (2010-2012) (Reference 5). The SPIS list offers no specific improvement
recommendations for this intersection.

In addition to reviewing the Washington County SPIS list, crash histories at each of the study
intersections were reviewed in an effort to identify potential intersection safety issues. Crash data was
obtained from ODOT for the five-year period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2012. Table 2
illustrates the crashes reported at the study intersections. Appendix E contains the ODOT crash data.

methodology presented in ODOT’s SPR 667 Assessment of Statewide Intersection Safety Performance
(Reference 6). SPR 667 provided average crash rates at a variety of intersection configurations in
Oregon based on the number of approaches and traffic control types. The average crash rate
represents the approximate number of crashes that are “expected” at a study intersection.
Additionally, this average crash rate was used to calculate the critical crash rate for each study
intersection, based on the Highway Safety Manual methodology (Reference 7). The critical crash rate is
calculated for each intersection based on the average crash rate for each facility and serves as a
threshold for further analysis.

Table 3 summarizes the critical crash rate for each intersection and compares those values to the
observed crash rate. Per ODOT, if the observed crash rate at the study location exceeds the critical
rate, it is a possible indication that the location is exceeding average crash rates.

As shown in Table 3, none of the observed crash rates exceed the critical crash rate. Based on the
analysis presented herein, no safety-related mitigation measures are recommended.

Intersection Sight Distance
Intersection sight distance was observed at the study intersections and was found to meet city and
county standards, with the exception of the sight distance at the SW 90th Avenue/SW Oak Street
intersection. As shown in Exhibit 1 below, SW 90th Avenue intersects SW Oak Street at a skew angle.
Existing pavement striping orients southbound drivers on SW 90th Avenue to a 90 degree angle for
turning left or right onto SW Oak Street. The stop bar on SW 90th Avenue is set back approximately 15
feet from the edge of SW Oak Street.

Intersection sight distance was measured from SW 90th Avenue according to City of Tigard
specifications, which indicates that measurements should be taken 15 feet from the near edge of
pavement. The available intersection sight distance was measured to be approximately 250 feet to the
west direction (facing right) and 300 feet to the east direction (facing left)1. However, this assumes
vehicles pull up past the stop bar to the edge of SW Oak Street. Vehicles stopped at the stop bar have
approximately 200 feet of sight distance facing in the west direction. Photos taken from the
perspective of a vehicle stopped at the stop bar are provided in Exhibits 2 and 3.

    The 2011 version of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (Reference 8) recommends intersection
sight distance for left turns from a stop for a 25 miles per hour roadway to be designed at 280 feet.

Exhibit 3: View Facing Southbound on SW 90th Avenue at Stop Bar, Looking East (to the left)




Sight distance at the intersection facing to the west from 90th Avenue could be improved by trimming
the trees on the northwest side of the intersection, highlighted in Exhibit 2. Sight distance at the
intersection could be furthered enhanced by the addition of curbs and sidewalks to further define
vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian travel paths2. We recommend that the A+O Apartments
development team collaborate with the City of Tigard regarding potential improvements to the
intersection.


TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
The traffic impact analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system will operate upon
build out of the proposed site redevelopment. The impact of site-generated weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hour trips was examined as follows:
                Planned developments and transportation improvements in the site vicinity were identified
                 and reviewed;
                Year 2015 background traffic conditions (build-out year of the proposed redevelopment
                 without site-generated traffic) were analyzed at the study intersections;
                Future peak hour site-generated trips were estimated for build-out of the site;
                A trip distribution pattern was prepared;
                Forecast year 2015 total traffic conditions were analyzed during the weekday a.m. and p.m.
                 peak hours with build-out of the site; and

    Depending on what improvement options are ultimately identified, it may be necessary to address the location of an
existing private driveway currently situated north of the stop bar on the west side of the intersection.

Year 2015 Background Traffic Conditions
The year 2015 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area’s transportation system will
operate prior to the proposed redevelopment. This analysis accounts for traffic attributed to planned
developments within the study area and includes general growth in the region, but does not include
traffic from the proposed redevelopment. A two percent annual growth rate was used for the analysis
and no improvements or developments are planned or in-process in the area.

2015 Background Conditions Intersection Operations
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the forecast 2015 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning-movement
volumes at the study intersections, respectively. As shown in the figures, each of the study
intersections are projected to operate acceptably during weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

Appendix F contains the background traffic analysis worksheets.


Proposed Development Plan
DBG Oak Street, LLC is proposing the development of up to 215 apartments immediately southeast of
the SW Oak Street/SW 90th Avenue intersection within the Washington Square Regional Center. Access
to the apartment complex will be provided three accesses on SW Oak Street. The west access will be
aligned with SW 90th Avenue. The center access will be approximately 200 feet east of this access. The
far west access will be approximately 300 feet east of the center access. All driveways are proposed to
allow full movements. Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual site plan and site-driveway locations.


Trip Generation
Trip estimates for the proposed apartment complex were based on trip rates obtained from the
standard reference Trip Generation, 9th Edition (Reference 9). Table 4 presents the trip generation
estimate used in this study.

As shown in Table 4, the trip generation estimate indicates approximately 110 additional weekday a.m.
peak hour trips and 135 additional weekday p.m. peak hour trips will result from the proposed
development.

Trip Distribution and Transportation System Access Issues
The distribution of site-generated trips onto the study area roadway system was estimated based on a
review of existing peak hour directional travel characteristics, existing site-driveway patterns, and
surrounding roadway characteristics and land uses. The assignments of the site-generated trips to the
study intersections during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours are shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. The
distribution is shown in the figures and summarized below:

                25% to/from the north on Highway 217
                35% to/from the south on Highway 217
                15% to/from the south on SW Greenburg Road
                15% to/from the north on SW Hall Boulevard or SW Greenburg Road
                10% to/from the south on SW Hall Boulevard
At Greenburg Road, SW Oak Street is limited to right turn movements only. To access Highway 217
from the site, residents can use Hall Boulevard or travel north on SW 90th Avenue to access Locust
Road (which intersects with Greenburg Road at a signalized intersection). These restrictions will affect
the routing of vehicles to/from the site.


Year 2015 Total Traffic Conditions
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area’s transportation system will operate
with the traffic generated by the proposed site redevelopment. The estimated site-generated traffic
volumes were added to the estimated year 2015 background traffic volumes to arrive at the total
traffic volumes. The lane configurations assumed for the 2015 total traffic analysis are provided in
Figure 10.

As shown in Figure 10, the SW 90th Avenue approach to SW Oak Street will need to be re-configured to
accommodate the southbound through movement. Specifically, it is recommended that the current
southbound left-turn lane on SW 90th Avenue be-restriped to serve as a shared through/left-turn lane.
In addition, a STOP sign should be installed on the new northbound driveway approach, as well as on
the northbound driveway approaches on the other two proposed accesses for consistency. The
approach re-striping and corresponding signage as well as the new northbound STOP signs should be
installed in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). In addition, as we
discussed previously, sight distance at the intersection could be furthered enhanced by trimming the
trees at the northwest side of the intersection and adding curbs and sidewalks to further define
vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian travel paths. We recommend that the development team collaborate
with the City of Tigard regarding potential improvements to the intersection.

during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively. As shown, each of the study intersections is
projected to operate within the applicable standards during both the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
hours. As under existing and background conditions, all intersections operate at a LOS “B” or better
during the weekday a.m. peak hour. During the weekday p.m. peak hour, all intersections continue
operate at a LOS “B” or better with the exception of the OR 217 ramp terminals. The northbound
ramps/Greenburg Road operate at a LOS “D”; the southbound ramps/Greenburg Road operate at a LOS
“C.” Both ramp intersections meet ODOT mobility standards There are no changes to the level of
service anticipated at any of the intersections as a result of the proposed A+O apartments and each
intersection operates well within applicable standards. No off-site transportation impacts are projected
at any of the study intersections.

Appendix G contains the year 2015 total traffic operations worksheets.


OR 217 Ramps Queuing
Queuing at the OR 217 off-ramps was analyzed under existing and future conditions based on collected
data and using Synchro7. Along with the counts conducted in March 2014, a queuing study was
conducted for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The observed queue on the off-ramps for each
cycle of the signal was noted. The data is provided in Appendix H.

The observed queues and estimated queues from Synchro7 for existing and projected future conditions
were compared to available queue storage. The results for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours are
provided in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. Each vehicle is assumed to take up 25 feet in the queue and
queues are rounded up to the nearest car length.

Appendix I contains the Synchro7 queuing operations worksheets for the OR 217 Ramps.

As seen in the tables, the proposed development has a negligible impact on the OR 217 off-ramp
queues. Sufficient queue storage is available to accommodate both existing and future projected
queues.


ON-SITE CIRCULATION AND OPERATIONS
Internal circulation was evaluated to ensure that the site provides sufficient on-site circulation for
pedestrian movements and internal traffic. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed development plan.

On-site sidewalks will be provided along the site frontage and throughout the development. On-site
landscaping, signage and any above-ground utilities should be provided appropriately to ensure that
adequate sight distance is provided and maintained.


On-site Queuing Analysis
Estimated 95th percentile queues at the proposed accesses on SW Oak Street were obtained from the
Synchro analyses for 2015 total traffic conditions. Queue lengths shown were rounded up to the
nearest car length, assuming that the average vehicle queue length is 25 feet. Table 7 presents the
results.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of this transportation impact analysis, the proposed DBG Oak Street apartment
complex can be developed while maintaining acceptable levels of service and safety at the study
intersections. The primary findings and recommendations of this study are summarized below.


Findings
                The study intersections operate acceptably under existing and projected future background
                 conditions.
                The proposed site development is estimated to generate a net increase of approximately
                 110 weekday a.m. peak hour trips and 135 weekday p.m. peak hour trips.
                Vehicle access to the development is proposed via three accesses on SW Oak Street.
                All of the study intersections operate acceptably with the proposed development build-out
                 in 2015.


Recommendations
                The SW 90th Avenue approach to SW Oak Street should be re-configured to accommodate
                 the southbound through movement into the site driveway in conjunction with site
                 redevelopment. Specifically, it is recommended that the current southbound left-turn lane
                 on SW 90th Avenue be-restriped to serve as a shared through/left-turn lane. In addition, a
                 STOP sign should be installed on the new northbound driveway approach, as well as on the
                 northbound driveway approaches on the other two proposed accesses for consistency. The
                 approach re-striping and corresponding signage as well as the new northbound STOP signs
                 should be installed in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
                 (MUTCD). In addition, sight distance at the intersection could be furthered enhanced by
                 trimming the trees at the northwest side of the intersection and adding curbs and sidewalks
                 to further define vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian travel paths. We recommend that the
                 A+O Apartments development team collaborate with the City of Tigard regarding potential
                 improvements to the intersection.
                On-site landscaping and any above ground utilities should be located and maintained to
                 provide adequate intersection sight distance at the site driveways in conjunction with site
                 development.

APPENDIX A LEVEL-OF-SERVICE CONCEPT
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from “A” to “F”.1


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
The six level-of-service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table A1.
Additionally, Table A2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per
vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service “D” is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

Table A-1 Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

      Level of
      Service                                                             Average Delay per Vehicle
                      Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and most
         A
                      vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
                      Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally
         B            occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of
                      average delay.
                      Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher
         C            delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
                      The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
                      Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of
                      congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
         D
                      length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle
                      failures are noticeable.
                      Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually
         E            considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long
                      cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                      Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This condition
         F            often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures.
                      Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service levels associated
with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table A3. A quantitative definition of level of service
for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table A4. Using this definition, Level of Service “E” is
generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is
that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on
the minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying
acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the HCM
level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

CALIBRATION
This appendix describes the calibration performed to the Synchro model used for the operational
analysis as part of the traffic study for the proposed A+O Apartment development in Tigard, Oregon.
The purpose of the calibration is to accurately reflect existing conditions with the Synchro model and
better project future operations.


Background
The Synchro model for the study area was developed based on GIS data of street lengths and
intersection locations, field observation, and signal timing provided by the Oregon Department of
Transportation (ODOT) and Washington County. Turning movement counts were collected at the study
intersections during a typical weekday in March 2014. Vehicle and pedestrian volumes, truck
percentages, link speeds, and signal timing parameters were coded in the Synchro model.

The pre-calibration operational results for the weekday p.m. peak hour in Synchro indicated that the
southbound movement at the OR 217 Northbound Ramps/Greenburg Road was operating over
capacity. Given that the traffic counts collected reflect processed demand, the Synchro model should
not reflect any movements over capacity. In addition, review of the video data collected indicated that
vehicles consistently clear the intersection in a single-cycle. In order to more accurately reflect existing
conditions, video data collected at the ramps was analyzed and the Synchro model was calibrated
based on video observation and engineering judgment.


Calibration
The lost time (which reflects the sum of the startup loss time less extension into the yellow time) for
the southbound movement in the Synchro model was adjusted based on video observation. The lost
time was estimated based on how aggressively vehicles started up and used the yellow time. The lost
time was measured to be -2.5 seconds and Synchro was adjusted accordingly. With this adjustment,
the southbound approach volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio changed from 1.14 to 1.01. While this
suggests that Synchro is still underestimating capacity of the southbound movement and
overestimating delays, it more closely matches field observation. The calibration and resulting
operations are shown in Table B-1.

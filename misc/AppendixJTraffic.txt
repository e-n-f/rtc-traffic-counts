EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This study analyzes the transportation impacts related to the proposed Fulton Mall Reconstruction
project.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project consists of reconstructing the existing Fulton Mall according to one of three design
alternatives:

   ►   Alternative 1: Reconnect the Grid on Traditional Streets – completely remove the existing
       pedestrian mall and introduce a narrow, two-lane, two-way enhanced street with oversized
       sidewalks, stately trees, and on-street parking throughout the Fulton Mall and its cross streets.

   ►   Alternative 2: Reconnect the Grid with Vignettes – introduce a two-way street throughout the
       Fulton Mall, keeping selected features in their original Mall contexts (“vignettes”), in a manner that
       provides improved retail visibility and some on-street parking. Transform Kern, Mariposa, and
       Merced Malls into enhanced streets with narrow traffic ways, ample sidewalks, stately trees, and on-
       street parking.

   ►   Alternative 3: Restoration and Completion – Keep Fulton Street, Merced Street, Mariposa Street,
       and Kern Street Malls pedestrian-only. Renovate and repair the pedestrian malls in their entirety,
       including their landscape and hardscape, and restore the artwork.

From a vehicle transportation perspective, Alternatives 1 and 2 generate similar traffic conditions by
opening Fulton Mall to vehicular traffic with a narrow two-lane, two-way local serving roadway.
Alternative 3 would differ from Alternatives 1 and 2 by maintaining the pedestrian-only mall. For the
purposes of this study, Alternatives 1 and 2 are referred to as the “Open to Traffic” alternatives and
Alternative 3 is referred to as the “Pedestrian Mall” alternative.

BASELINE CONDITIONS

AM and PM peak hour traffic counts were collected at the study intersections on weekdays between
November 2009 and January 2012. While these counts were taken over the course of a little more than a
two-year period, the traffic counts demonstrate that traffic volumes have roughly remained the same or
slightly decreased during this time period. A review of traffic counts collected in 2009 and 2011 on the
Fresno Street and Tulare Street corridors in Downtown Fresno show that traffic volumes have either
stayed roughly the same or decreased by up to 20 percent, with an average decrease of about 10 percent.
Therefore, using the slightly older counts from November 2009 represents similar or slightly more
congested traffic conditions as those observed in 2011 and 2012.

Daily roadway traffic count data was obtained from the City of Fresno and the High Speed Rail EIR. These
traffic counts were collected between March and November 2009. The baseline conditions roadway
operations analysis uses roadway geometrics and traffic control as observed in Fall 2011.




                                                                                                        ES-1
Final Transportation Impact Report
Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project
July 2013


Under baseline conditions, all study intersections operate at LOS D or better.

BASELINE PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

The proposed project would result in the following transportation impacts:

Impact B-1: The proposed project could cause potentially significant impacts to traffic operations
            at study intersections.
Significance: Less Than Significant

    The proposed project would not significantly change traffic volumes. For the Baseline Plus Project
    Conditions – Pedestrian Mall alternative, traffic volumes and intersection operations would remain the
    same as Baseline Conditions.

    For the Baseline Plus Project Conditions – Mall Open to Traffic alternatives, minor shifts in traffic
    patterns are expected to occur as the result of opening Fulton Mall and its cross steers to vehicular
    traffic. However, the proposed streets under these alternatives would primarily carry local trips to
    access adjacent businesses and would not greatly affect traffic volumes or traffic operations.

    Table 5 shows that all study intersections would operate at LOS D or better with the proposed project.

    Therefore, this impact is less than significant.

Impact B-2: The proposed project could cause potentially significant impacts to traffic operations
            and bicycle and pedestrian circulation during construction.
Significance: Potentially Significant

    Construction may include disruptions to the transportation network near the site, including the
    possibility of temporary closures. Heavy vehicles would access the site and may need to be staged for
    construction. These activities could result in degraded roadway operating conditions as well as cause
    impacts to bicycle and pedestrian facilities along the existing Fulton Mall.

    Therefore, this impact is considered potentially significant.

Mitigation B-2:

    Prior to the beginning of construction, a construction traffic management plan shall be prepared to
    address potential impacts to transportation facilities. The plan shall ensure that acceptable operating
    conditions are maintained on local roadways as well as detours or facilities for bicyclists, pedestrians,
    and transit users. Implementation of this mitigation measure would reduce the above impact to less
    than significant.

Residual Significance: Less Than Significant




                                                                                                        ES-2
Final Transportation Impact Report

Impact B-3: The proposed project could cause potentially significant impacts to transit service.
Significance: Less Than Significant

    The proposed project would not adversely affect existing or planned transit facilities. The proposed
    project would not conflict with adopted plans, policies, or programs regarding transit facilities.
    Therefore, this impact is considered less than significant.

Impact B-4: The proposed project could cause potentially significant impacts to bicycle and
            pedestrian facilities.
Significance: Less Than Significant

    The Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project proposes either restoring the existing pedestrian mall or
    replacing the pedestrian mall with a new roadway. For the Pedestrian Mall alternative, the mall’s existing
    use as a pedestrian and bicycle facility would remain. Therefore, there would be no impact to bicycle
    and pedestrian facilities except during construction activity (see Impact B-2).

    For the Mall Open to Traffic alternatives, the Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project proposes wide
    pedestrian areas and a local-serving roadway carrying vehicle traffic at relatively low speeds. This would
    maintain the Mall as a bicycle and pedestrian friendly facility.

    Since the proposed project would not adversely affect existing or planned bicycle or pedestrian
    networks this impact is considered less than significant.

Impact B-5: The proposed project could result in increased hazards due to design features.
Significance: Potentially Significant

    For the Pedestrian Mall alternative, the mall would be improved to enhance accessibility and reduce
    hazards to pedestrians. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant under this alternative.

    For the Mall Open to Traffic alternatives, vehicle traffic would be reintroduced into the corridor.
    Depending on the design of the roadway and the alternative selected, there is the potential for
    increased hazards from the interaction between travel modes (i.e., vehicles and pedestrians, vehicles and
    bicyclists, etc.) and the visibility (or lack thereof) of each at interaction points.

    Therefore, this impact is considered potentially significant.

Mitigation B-5:

    If one of the Mall Open to Traffic alternatives is selected, the project design shall consider issues such as
    design speed, sight distance, and bicycle and pedestrian treatments to enhance traveler safety.
    Specifically, if Alternative B (Reconnect the Grid with Vignettes) is selected, the placement of art pieces in
    the project design shall consider drivers’ ability to see pedestrians and cyclists at likely interaction points,
    such as intersections and mid-block crossings.




                                                                                                               ES-3

    Implementation of this mitigation measure would reduce the above impact to less than significant.

Residual Significance: Less Than Significant

CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS

The Cumulative Conditions analysis identifies the proposed project’s incremental contribution to traffic
congestion when viewed in connection with the effects of reasonably foreseeable future projects. For
purposes of this study, the proposed project’s incremental contribution to cumulative traffic congestion is
measured by comparing the traffic analysis results of Cumulative No Project Conditions to Cumulative
Plus Project Conditions.

This study uses local and regional planning and funding documents to identify the reasonably foreseeable
changes to the transportation system and development patterns in the Fresno region for the cumulative
conditions analysis. This study uses the Fresno Council of Governments (Fresno COG) 2035 population
and employment forecasts as land use inputs for future development in the region.

This study uses the financially constrained list of transportation projects from the Fresno COG 2011
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) to identify future transportation improvements in the area. This study
also incorporates the proposed circulation changes associated with the proposed High Speed Rail
trackway project expected to begin construction in 2013.

Under Cumulative No Project Conditions, the following five intersections would operate at LOS E or F
during the AM and/or PM peak hour:

►   Stanislaus Street / Broadway                   ►   Fresno Street / Van Ness Avenue
►   Tuolumne Street / Broadway                     ►   Ventura Avenue / H Street
►   Fresno Street / H Street

All of these intersections are located within the Core Area, defined as the area bounded by State Routes
99, 41, and 180 in Fulton Corridor Specific Plan policy 9-3-1. Per the City of Fresno’s General Plan policy
MT-1-m, LOS E and F operations are acceptable at City of Fresno intersections within the Downtown
Neighborhoods Community Plan area and the Fulton Corridor Specific Plan area. Therefore, all
intersections are considered to operate at an acceptable level of service.




                                                                                                      ES-4

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Under Cumulative Plus Project Conditions, the proposed project would have the following cumulatively
considerable transportation impacts:

Impact C-1: The proposed project could contribute to traffic conditions that result in significant
            impacts to traffic operations at study intersections.
Significance: Less Than Significant

    The proposed project is anticipated to potentially stimulate and support future development in the
    Project Area. However, the proposed project is not expected to greatly change traffic patterns in the
    Study Area.

    For the Pedestrian Mall alternative, traffic volumes and intersection operations would remain the same
    as Cumulative No Project Conditions.

    For the Mall Open to Traffic alternatives, minor shifts in traffic patterns are expected to occur as the
    result of opening Fulton Mall to vehicular traffic. However, the proposed streets under these
    alternatives would primarily carry local trips to access adjacent businesses and would not greatly
    affect traffic volumes or traffic operations.

    Table 9 shows that the following four study intersections would operate at LOS E or F during the AM
    and/or PM peak hour under Cumulative Plus Project Conditions with the Mall Open to Traffic
    alternatives:

      ►     Stanislaus Street / Broadway                ►   Fresno Street / H Street
      ►     Tuolumne Street / Broadway                  ►   Ventura Avenue / H Street

    All of these intersections are located within the Core Area, defined as the area bounded by State
    Routes 99, 41, and 180 in Fulton Corridor Specific Plan policy 9-3-1. Per the City of Fresno’s General
    Plan policy MT-1-m, LOS E and F operations are acceptable at City of Fresno intersections within the
    Downtown Neighborhoods Community Plan area and the Fulton Corridor Specific Plan area.
    Therefore, all intersections are considered to operate at an acceptable level of service.

    Since these intersections all operate acceptably, this impact is less than significant.




                                                                                                       ES-5

CHAPTER 1.                 INTRODUCTION

This study analyzes the transportation impacts related to the proposed Fulton Mall Reconstruction project
(“proposed project”). This includes the proposed project’s anticipated effects on vehicular, transit, bicycle,
and pedestrian travel. The study identifies mitigation measures to address project impacts where
appropriate.

PURPOSE

The analysis contained in this report provides information for the transportation section of the
environmental documents being prepared for the proposed project. For the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), the information from this study is incorporated into the project’s environmental
impact report (EIR). For the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the information from this study is
incorporated into the project’s environmental assessment (EA). The methodologies used in this study
comply with applicable CEQA and NEPA guidelines and requirements.

This study analyzes the following scenarios to determine the effect of the proposed project:

   ►   Baseline Conditions Analysis – The baseline and baseline plus project analyses are used to identify
       the effects directly related to the proposed project. Baseline roadway operations were analyzed
       using roadway geometrics as observed in Fall 2011 and traffic volumes obtained from November
       2009 through January 2012.

   ►   Cumulative Conditions Analysis – The Cumulative Conditions scenario analyzes the proposed
       project’s incremental effects to traffic congestion when viewed in connection with the effects of
       reasonably foreseeable future projects. This analysis uses local land use plans and regional
       population and employment forecasts as land use inputs for future development in the region. The
       analysis also includes reasonably foreseeable roadway network changes including funded roadway
       improvement projects identified in the Fresno COG 2011 Regional Transportation Plan and
       applicable local and regional impact fee programs.

STUDY AREA

Figure 1 shows the selected Study Area, including the proposed project location and existing
transportation network.

The selected Study Area was determined through consultation with City of Fresno and Caltrans District 6
staff, the City of Fresno Traffic Impact Study Report Guidelines (City of Fresno, 2009), and the transportation
impact analysis conducted for the Downtown Neighborhoods Community Plan (DNCP) and Fulton
Corridor Specific Plan (FCSP).

Fulton Mall is located at the center of Fresno’s Central Business District, and consists of six blocks
bounded by Van Ness Avenue to the east, Inyo Street to the south, Broadway to the west, and Tuolumne
Street to the north. The Fulton Mall project area includes a 2,670-foot long north-south pedestrian-only



                                                                                                             1

mall along Fulton Street, with three shorter east-west pedestrian malls on Merced Street, Mariposa Street,
and Kern Street where they cross the Fulton Mall. Together, the total linear length of the pedestrian mall
complex is 4,620 feet. Fresno Street and Tulare Street carry east-west traffic through the project area with
traffic signals where they cross Fulton Mall.

The following 18 study intersections and 16 roadway segments are evaluated for this analysis:

Intersections

    1.   Stanislaus Street / Van Ness Avenue           10. Tulare Street / H Street
    2.   Stanislaus Street / Fulton Street             11. Tulare Street / Fulton Street
    3.   Stanislaus Street / Broadway                  12. Tulare Street / Van Ness Avenue
    4.   Tuolumne Street / Broadway                    13. Inyo Street / H Street
    5.   Tuolumne Street / Fulton Street               14. Inyo Street / Fulton Street
    6.   Tuolumne Street / Van Ness Avenue             15. Inyo Street / Van Ness Avenue
    7.   Fresno Street / H Street                      16. Ventura Avenue / H Street
    8.   Fresno Street / Fulton Street                 17. Ventura Avenue / Broadway
    9.   Fresno Street / Van Ness Avenue               18. Ventura Avenue / Van Ness Avenue

Fresno Street currently travels under H Street via a grade-separated underpass. The City of Fresno intends
to make this an at-grade intersection in the future. The Fresno Street / Fulton Street and Tulare Street /
Fulton Street intersections are currently locations where Fulton Mall crosses these east-west streets with
traffic signals to allow pedestrians to cross.

PROJECT PURPOSE

Per Section 1.3 of the Fulton Mall Reconstruction Draft EA, the purpose of the Fulton Mall Reconstruction
project is to:

    ►    Maximize the economic productivity of the Project Area

    ►    Maximize mobility, circulation, and access in and around the Project Area for people using many
         different modes of travel

    ►    Lower crime and improve the quality of life for living in, working in, and visiting the Project Area

    ►    Encourage sustainable development by promoting the concentration of buildings and people in
         Downtown Fresno, consistent with the objectives of the draft City of Fresno 2035 General Plan

REGULATORY SETTING

This section summarizes the transportation policies, laws, and regulations that apply to the proposed
project. This information provides context for the impact discussion related to the project’s consistency
with applicable regulatory conditions. Further, this study identifies impacts to traffic operations by
comparing roadway LOS analysis results against LOS policies set forth by the City of Fresno.

California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is responsible for operating and maintaining the
state highway system. The proposed project is located approximately ½-mile from State Routes 41 and
99, and less than one-mile from State Route 180. These state highways along with their on- and off-ramps
and the intersections at ramp terminals are under Caltrans jurisdiction.

The proposed project’s transportation and traffic effects would be localized to the project area and are
not expected to affect Caltrans facilities.

Caltrans is the lead agency for the NEPA EA.

Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies

Caltrans’ Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (Caltrans, 2002) provides general guidance
regarding the preparation of traffic impacts studies for projects that may have an impact on the State
Highway System. The guidance includes when a traffic study should be prepared and the methodology to
use when evaluating operating conditions on the State highway system.

Fresno Council of Governments (Fresno COG)

The Fresno Council of Governments (Fresno COG) is an association of local governments in Fresno
County. Fresno COG provides transportation planning and funding for the region, and serves as a forum
for the study and resolution of regional issues. In addition to preparing the region’s long-range




                                                                                                                4

transportation plan, Fresno COG assists in planning for transit, bicycle networks, clean air, and airport land
uses.

2011 Fresno COG Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)

The 2011 Fresno COG Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) (Fresno COG, 2010) is a federally mandated
long-range fiscally constrained transportation plan for Fresno County. The area is designated a federal
non-attainment area for ozone, indicating that the transportation system is required to meet stringent air
quality emissions targets to reduce pollutant levels that contribute to ozone formation. To receive federal
funding, transportation projects nominated by cities, counties, and agencies must be consistent with the
RTP.

The 2011 Fresno COG RTP also includes the following relevant goals and policies:

   ►   Develop a regional streets and highways system that has a balanced mix of high-speed and local
       corridors which are functional and flexible for intermodal use.

   ►   Integrate transportation modes through a coordinated transportation systems management
       process.

   ►   Decisions on improvements to the transportation system shall take into account the effective use of
       all modes and facilities.

   ►   Encourage jurisdictions to ensure that the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and individuals with
       disabilities are given special attention in the project review process.

   ►   Encourage local jurisdictions to provide incentives to encourage transit, ridesharing, walking and
       bicycling.

   ►   Manage the transportation system in a manner designed to increase operational efficiency,
       conserve energy and space, reduce air pollution and noise, and provide for effective goods
       movement, safety, personal mobility, and accessibility.

   ►   Work closely with local land use agencies to ensure that land use planning is coordinated with
       transportation planning to fully mitigate the traffic impacts of new development to the greatest
       degree possible.

   ►   Existing and future land use plans of the communities within the region shall be recognized in the
       formulation of transportation decisions.

   ►   Encourage and support mixed land use developments that encourage a jobs/housing balance and
       that make alternative modes more effective.

   ►   Monitor levels of service on the streets and highways network within Fresno County to ensure safe
       and efficient movement of people and goods.




                                                                                                            5

   ►   Consider development of a multimodal transportation terminal facility in, or in close proximity to,
       the Central Business District.

   ►   Support the planning and construction of a High Speed Rail System in the San Joaquin Valley which
       directly connects the major population centers within the Valley.

   ►   Encourage projects proposing pedestrian or transit oriented designs at suitable locations.

Fresno Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Master Plan

The Fresno COG Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Master Plan studies the possibility of BRT service in the Fresno-
Clovis Metropolitan Area. The study recommends BRT service in the Ventura Avenue/Kings Canyon Road
corridor and the Blackstone Avenue/Abby Street corridor with service routed through Downtown to
connect the two corridors. In addition, the Master Plan cites previous transit studies, including the Transit
Master Plan (1994), the Transit Long Range Master Plan (2001), and the Downtown Transportation and
Infrastructure Study (2007).

City of Fresno Downtown Transportation and Infrastructure Study

The City of Fresno Downtown Transportation and Infrastructure Study builds upon prior planning efforts
to integrate and coordinate these plans and outline a strategy to implement transportation
improvements. The recommendations from this study include:

   ►   Increasing the importance of public transit as an access mode to Downtown

   ►   Transitioning away from pulse operations at the current Courthouse Transit Center to a more urban
       street corridor service with bus stops on both curb faces of Van Ness Avenue

   ►   Implement a Downtown Circulator linking parking, outlying employment and destination sites, and
       the Downtown Core

   ►   Supporting transit priority treatments, improved pedestrian facilities, and improved wayfinding in
       Downtown Fresno

Fresno Area Express (FAX)

The Fresno Area Express (FAX) provides public transit service within the project area. FAX operates 16 bus
routes covering City of Fresno.

FAX’s Short-Range Transit Plan (2011) is the short-term plan for transit service and transit capital
improvements over the next five years. The Short-Range Transit Plan (SRTP) places significant emphasis on
improved transit service throughout the region through a combination of infrastructure investments and
service modifications. This includes the implementation of BRT service in the Blackstone Avenue/Abby
Street and Ventura Avenue/Kings Canyon Road corridors, purchase of new articulated buses, transit signal
prioritization, a Downtown Circulator (electric bus), and enhanced passenger amenities in Downtown.




                                                                                                           6

The Long-Range Transit Plan (2002) identifies transit system improvements over a 20 year period. The
Long-Range Transit Plan (LRTP) recommends increases in transit service (decreased headways) on highly
utilized routes, BRT service on Blackstone Avenue, Ventura Avenue/Kings Canyon Road, and Shaw Avenue,
and relocating the existing Downtown Transfer Center at Courthouse Park.

City of Fresno

The City of Fresno provides for the mobility of people and goods within the City. All of the study
intersections and roadway segments for this study are within the City of Fresno’s jurisdiction.

City of Fresno General Plan

The City of Fresno intends to consider the adoption of an update of the 2025 Fresno General Plan in 2014.
The Fresno General Plan Update would serve as the community’s guide for the continued development,
enhancement, and revitalization of the City of Fresno.

The General Plan Update includes the following policies related to transportation and circulation that are
relevant to this analysis:

   ►   Policy MT-1-l: Utilize to the extent feasible, a tiered system of flexible, multi-modal Level of
       Service standards for streets designated by the General Plan Circulation Diagram (Figure MT-1).
       Generally the City will strive to accommodate a peak hour vehicle LOS of “D” or better on street
       segments and at intersections except as further elaborated by following polices.

   ►   Policy MT-1-m: Within the Downtown Neighborhoods Community Plan area and the Fulton
       Corridor Specific Plan area, accept motor vehicle LOS “F” conditions during peak hours on street
       segments and intersections in the vicinity of these areas as specified by the applicable policies of
       these plans.

   ►   Policy MT-2-a: Provide incentives for more intense development along streets and roadways
       where through-traffic has been diverted to freeways and there is additional capacity.

   ►   Policy MT-2-c: Provide incentives for infill development that would provide jobs and services
       closer to housing, and vice versa, in order to reduce citywide vehicle miles travelled (VMT).

   ►   Policy MT-2-d: Along streets with excess roadway capacity where adjacent land use is not
       expected to change in the foreseeable future, evaluate opportunities to reduce right of way and/or
       re-design streets to support non-automobile travel modes.

   ►   Policy MT-2-f: Optimize roadway operations by continuing to expand the use of techniques such
       as the City’s intelligent transportation system (ITS) to manage traffic signal timing coordination in
       order to improve traffic operations and increase traffic carrying capacity while reducing
       unnecessary congestion and decreasing air pollution emissions.

   ►   Policy MT-4-a: Continue to implement and periodically update a Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Trails
       Master Plan, which was adopted on October 28, 2010, and may be subsequently amended to meet



                                                                                                          7

       requirements of the California Streets and Highways Code Section 891.4, including standards and
       recommended improvements and funding proposals as determined appropriate and feasible.

   ►   Policy MT-5-d: Minimize vehicular and pedestrian conflicts on both major and non-major streets
       through implementation of traffic access design and control standards addressing street
       intersections, median island openings and access driveways to facilitate accessibility while reducing
       congestion and increasing safety.

   ►   Policy MT-5-f: Continue to evaluate and consider modifications to street standards to achieve
       overall objectives of providing good access and travel opportunities while calming traffic,
       promoting pedestrian and other transportation options and reducing the amount of land devoted
       to streets.

   ►   Policy MT-8-f: Support the development of a multimodal transportation terminal facility as
       identified by the Downtown Neighborhoods Community Plan.

City of Fresno Traffic Impact Study Report Guidelines

The City of Fresno’s Traffic Impact Study Report Guidelines establish general procedures and requirements
for the preparation of traffic impact studies associated with development within the City of Fresno. The
guidelines are intended to be a checklist to ensure regular study items are not missed, but are not
intended to be prescriptive to the point of eliminating professional judgment.

The guidelines include the preferred traffic analysis methodologies, significance criteria, and
documentation requirements. This study is conducted using the preferred analysis methodologies and
significance criteria as outlined in the City’s guidelines.

City of Fresno Bicycle, Pedestrian, & Trails Master Plan

The City of Fresno Bicycle, Pedestrian, & Trails Master Plan (2010) guides and influences bikeway policies,
programs, and development standards to encourage bicycling in the City of Fresno. As an infrastructure
plan, the contents of the Bicycle, Pedestrian, & Trails Master Plan are intended to be incorporated into the
City’s regulatory plans.

The Plan includes a variety of resources for bicycle transportation including:

   ►   Identification of existing and planned bicycle facilities

   ►   Goals, objectives, and policies that expand upon objectives and policies in the 2025 Fresno General
       Plan and inform objectives and policies for the Fresno General Plan Update

   ►   Encouragement, education, and enforcement programs designed to increase bicycling in Fresno

   ►   Implementation steps for the planned bicycle network

The Bicycle, Pedestrian, & Trails Master Plan also includes a chapter focused on bicycle travel to and
around Downtown Fresno. This chapter identifies the existing and proposed bicycle network in Downtown



                                                                                                          8

Fresno, potential incentives, support facilities, and multi-modal connections to encourage cycling, and
phasing for implementing bicycle facilities in Downtown.

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

Based on the local and state policies and regulations listed above, the purpose and need statements in
chapter 1 of the Fulton Mall Reconstruction Draft EA, and the regulatory requirements in CEQA, this study
uses the following criteria to determine if the project causes a significant impact.

The proposed project may have a significant impact related to transportation and traffic if the project
causes one of the following:

    a.    Conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance, or policy that establishes a performance standard for
          the circulation system, including but not limited to vehicular traffic operations at intersections,
          streets, highways, and freeways, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and mass transit service.
    b. Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian
       facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities.
    c.    Substantially increase hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous
          intersections)

Additional detail on significance criteria used to identify impacts caused by the proposed project related
to items (a) and (b) listed above are discussed below. These criteria are based on the policies and
regulations of the City of Fresno identified in the regulatory setting section.

Traffic Operations

Based on the policies in the City of Fresno General Plan, the City of Fresno Traffic Impact Study Report
Guidelines, and consultation with City of Fresno Public Works staff, the proposed project would cause a
significant impact to the roadway system if it would:

   ►     Cause a City of Fresno intersection operating at an acceptable LOS to operate at an unacceptable
         LOS

   ►     Increase the average delay for a City of Fresno study intersection that is already operating at an
         unacceptable LOS by more than five seconds

Per Policy MT-1-m in the Fresno General Plan, LOS F motor vehicle operations are acceptable for City of
Fresno intersections located within the Downtown Neighborhoods Community Plan area and the Fulton
Corridor Specific Plan area as specified by applicable policies of these plans. Fulton Corridor Specific Plan
Policy 9-3-1 states that LOS F is allowed in the Core Area, defined as the area bounded by SR 99, 41, and
180.

The proposed project study area is within this Core Area. Therefore, LOS F vehicle traffic operations are
considered acceptable for this study.

Transit, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Facilities

The City of Fresno General Plan and Traffic Impact Study Report Guidelines do not establish specific
thresholds for impacts on transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities.

Based on item (b) in the significance criteria listed above, the project would cause a significant impact to
the transit system, bicycle network, and/or pedestrian facilities if it would:

   ►   Disrupt or interfere with existing or planned public transit services or facilities

   ►   Create an inconsistency with policies concerning transit systems set forth in the 2025 Fresno
       General Plan and the proposed General Plan Update or other applicable adopted policy document

   ►   Disrupt or interfere with existing or planned bicycle/pedestrian facilities

   ►   Result in unsafe conditions            for   pedestrians,   including   unsafe    pedestrian/bicycle   or
       pedestrian/vehicle conflicts

   ►   Result in unsafe conditions for bicycles, including unsafe bicycle/pedestrian or bicycle/vehicle
       conflicts

   ►   Create an inconsistency with policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems set forth in the
       Fresno General Plan or other applicable regulatory plans

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Travel Demand Forecasting

This study uses the most recently adopted Fresno COG regional travel demand forecasting (TDF) model
released in 2010 to forecast plus project and cumulative traffic volumes. The base year version of the
model was modified and calibrated within the study area to more accurately reflect baseline conditions.
Static validation tests consistent with Caltrans’ Travel Forecasting Guidelines (Caltrans, 1992) and FHWA’s
Model Validation and Reasonableness Checking Manual (FHWA, 1997) were completed to validate the TDF
model for the study area.

Traffic Operations

This study analyzes traffic operations using level of service (LOS) as the primary measure of performance.
Roadway LOS is a qualitative description of traffic flow from the perspective of motorists. The Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (Transportation Research Board, 2000) defines six levels of service from LOS A
representing the least congested traffic conditions to LOS F representing the most congested traffic
conditions. The City of Fresno Traffic Impact Study Report Guidelines (2009) and Caltrans’ Guide for the
Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (2002) recommend using the HCM methodology. Given the recent
release of the 2010 HCM and current limitations in the software and application of the 2010 HCM, City of
Fresno and Caltrans District 6 staff agreed on the use of the 2000 HCM methodology for this study.

Intersections

Intersection LOS is based on the control delay experienced by motorists traveling through the
intersection. At signalized intersections, the LOS is determined by the average control delay per vehicle, as
described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 HCM. Unsignalized intersections are evaluated using the
methodology contained in Chapter 17 of the 2000 HCM. The 2000 HCM does not define an overall
intersection LOS for side-street stop-controlled intersections; therefore, at side-street stop-controlled
intersections, this study reports the control delay and LOS for the movement with the greatest control
delay.

Tables 1 and 2 present the control delay thresholds for each LOS level for signalized and unsignalized
intersections, respectively. The analysis calculates control delay and LOS at each intersection using the
Synchro 7 analysis software, which is based on the 2000 HCM procedures.

Analysis Assumptions and Methodology Limitations

Key assumptions made in the process of this study include:

   ►   Baseline traffic counts collected in the field between March 2009 and January 2012 are
       representative of baseline conditions.

Travel Demand Forecasting Limitations

As noted earlier, this study uses the most recently adopted Fresno COG TDF model released in 2010, and
calibrated and validated the model for the project study subarea. While this makes the TDF model the
most valid and capable tool for forecasting future traffic volumes, the TDF model has some limitations in
its application for this study. For example, the model was designed to model traffic for regional air quality
conformity, and typically only includes the regional roadway network. Additional local roadways were
added to the model within the project study area to be able to generate future travel forecasts.

While the model was calibrated and is able to closely replicate baseline roadway segment volumes, the
model is more limited in its ability to forecast specific turning movement volumes, particularly in a more
compact grid network, such as Downtown Fresno. Drivers may choose from multiple routes in a grid
system based on signal progression, congestion, and individual preferences, and may use different routes
for the same trip. While the model accounts for segment level congestion, it is more limited in its ability to
directly account for changes in routes due to signal operations or driver preferences. To account for some
of these limitations, this study uses a process known as the “difference method” to develop turning
movement forecasts. This approach adjusts raw model volume forecasts by adding the forecasted
incremental growth from the TDF model to the baseline traffic counts.

Traffic Operations Limitations

This study uses analysis methodologies that are consistent with the City of Fresno’s Traffic Impact Study
Report Guidelines (2009) and Caltrans’ Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (2002). However,
these methodologies and the software tools consistent with these methodologies have certain limitations.
For example, the 2000 HCM results from the Synchro 7 software package do not take into account
additional delay or queuing that may occur due to a queue spilling out of or blocking a turn pocket at an
intersection. Also, the 2000 HCM methodology does not account for any additional delay incurred by
queues spilling back from adjacent intersections.

CHAPTER 2.                 BASELINE CONDITIONS

This chapter describes the baseline condition of the roadway, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian systems in
the study area. This study uses the baseline conditions as the baseline to measure the potential impacts of
proposed project.

ROADWAY NETWORK

The following describes key roadway facilities within the study area:

Fulton Street is the focal point of the proposed project. The corridor is a pedestrian mall that is closed to
vehicle traffic between Tuolumne Street and Inyo Street. North of Tuolumne Street and south of Inyo
Street, it is a two-lane, two-way north-south roadway. North of Divisadero Street, Fulton Street is a two-
lane, one-way southbound roadway with a partial interchange with SR 180 that carries traffic into
Downtown Fresno.

Van Ness Avenue is a north-south roadway that originates on the south at Railroad Avenue and travels
north through the Tower District. In the project area, it is generally a two- to four-lane, two-way street.
North of Divisadero Street, it transitions to a one-lane, one-way northbound roadway, connecting the
project area with SR 180, the Tower District, and Fresno City College. South of the project area, it has a
partial interchange with SR 41.

Stanislaus Street is a two- to three-lane one-way westbound roadway from Divisadero Street on the east
to B Street on the west. It has a two-lane, westbound grade separation over the UPRR tracks and a partial
interchange with SR 99.

Tuolumne Street is a two- to three-lane one-way eastbound roadway beginning at A Street on the west
and terminating at Divisadero Street on the east. It has a two-lane, eastbound grade separation over the
UPRR tracks.

Fresno Street is a four-lane roadway that travels along a northeast-southwest orientation in the study
area. Near Fulton Mall, it is generally a four-lane divided roadway, narrowing to two lanes as it travels
under a grade separated undercrossing of the UPRR tracks west of the Mall. It also has a diamond
interchange with SR 99 west of the study area.

Tulare Street is an east-west roadway. In the study area, it is a four-lane, divided roadway. West of the
study area, it narrows to a two-lane facility as it crosses the UPRR tracks. Tulare Street also has an
interchange with SR 41 (with Divisadero Street) east of the project area.

Ventura Avenue is a four-lane, east-west arterial south of the existing Fulton Mall. It becomes West
California Avenue on the southwest of the project area and Kings Canyon Road east of the project area. It
also has an interchange with SR 99.

TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND ROADWAY OPERATIONS

Traffic counts were collected at the study intersections on weekdays between November 2009 and
January 2012 (refer to Appendix B for traffic count data). These turning movement counts at study
intersections were taken during both the morning (7:00 – 9:00 am) and evening (4:00 – 6:00 pm) peak
periods. While these counts were taken over the course of a little more than a two-year period, the traffic
counts demonstrate that traffic volumes have roughly remained the same or slightly decreased during this
time period. A review of traffic counts collected in 2009 and 2011 on the Fresno Street and Tulare Street
corridors in Downtown Fresno show that traffic volumes have either stayed roughly the same or
decreased by up to 20 percent, with an average decrease of about 10 percent. Therefore, using the
slightly older counts from November 2009 along with the more recent traffic counts in 2011 and 2012
represent similar traffic conditions.

Daily roadway traffic count data was obtained from the City of Fresno and the High Speed Rail EIR. These
traffic counts were collected between March and November 2009 (refer to Appendix B for traffic count
data).

The baseline conditions roadway operations analysis uses roadway geometrics and traffic control as
observed in Fall 2011.

Figure 2 provides the peak hour traffic volumes, lane configurations, and traffic control used in the
baseline conditions analysis.

Intersection Operations

Table 3 summarizes the AM and PM peak hour level of service (LOS) at each study intersection under
baseline conditions (refer to Appendix C for calculations). Figure 3 also shows the peak hour intersection
LOS. Based on the results in Table 3, all study intersections operate at LOS D or better under baseline
conditions.

BICYCLE FACILITIES

Bicycle facilities are relatively limited within the project area. Bicycle facilities can be classified into one of
the following three categories:

   ►      Class I Bike Path – Off-street bike paths within exclusive right-of-way

   ►      Class II Bike Lane – Striped on-road bike lanes adjacent to the outside travel lane on preferred
          corridors for biking

   ►      Class III Bike Route – Shared on-road facility, usually delineated by signage


                                                                                                                              18
Final Transportation Impact Report
Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project
July 2013


According to the City of Fresno Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Trails Master Plan (2010) and field observations,
the following Class II bike lanes are present within the study area:

    ►    Stanislaus Street: Divisadero Street to Broadway

    ►    Tuolumne Street: Broadway to Divisadero Street

In addition, the Fulton Mall and Mariposa Mall allow bicyclists to use the pedestrian mall as a bicycle
facility.

In the vicinity of the study area, there are also Class II bike lanes located on:

    ►    H Street: Tuolumne Street to Divisadero Street

    ►    M Street: Divisadero Street to San Benito Street

    ►    P Street: Fresno Street to Divisadero Street

In addition to the existing bicycle facilities listed above, the City of Fresno Bicycle, Pedestrian, & Trails
Master Plan (2010) identifies a recommended network of bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes that may
be implemented in the future. As noted in the regulatory setting section, the Bicycle, Pedestrian, & Trails
Master Plan was adopted by the Fresno City Council as an infrastructure plan whose contents are intended
to be incorporated into the City’s regulatory plans. Figure 4 shows the location of existing and
recommended bicycle facilities in the study area as identified in the Bicycle, Pedestrian, & Trails Master
Plan.

PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES

Within the Study Area, sidewalks are located on most streets. Southwest of the study area across the
UPRR tracks, sidewalks are more intermittent.

The existing Fulton Mall along with Kern Mall, Mariposa Mall, and Merced Mall are also current pedestrian
facilities within the project study area.

TRANSIT SERVICE

Fresno Area Express (FAX) operates most of the bus service within the City of Fresno and Fresno-Clovis
Metropolitan Area. In addition, the Fresno County Rural Transit Agency (FCRTA) provides intercity bus
service connecting Downtown Fresno with outlying cities, towns, and rural areas within Fresno County.

The Downtown Transit Mall located at Courthouse Park is directly adjacent to the project area, and is a
major transfer location between FAX Routes 20, 22, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, and 38 as well as FCRTA intercity
bus routes.

The following 13 fixed-route bus lines currently stop at the Downtown Transit Mall:

The current configuration of the Downtown Transit Mall features three primary bus shelters: two that front
Van Ness Avenue and one on Fresno Street. The bus shelters are spaced relatively far apart compared to
typical transit centers that offer transfers between multiple routes.

Figure 5 presents the existing transit service in the study area.

CHAPTER 3.                 BASELINE PLUS PROJECT

This chapter presents the transportation analysis for baseline plus project conditions. This scenario
analyzes the impacts of the proposed project on baseline conditions.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project consists of reconstructing the existing Fulton Mall according to one of three design
alternatives:

   ►   Alternative 1: Reconnect the Grid on Traditional Streets – completely remove the existing
       pedestrian mall and introduce a narrow, two-lane, two-way enhanced street with oversized
       sidewalks, stately trees, and on-street parking throughout the Fulton Mall and its cross streets.

   ►   Alternative 2: Reconnect the Grid with Vignettes – introduce a two-way street throughout the
       Fulton Mall, keeping selected features in their original Mall contexts (“vignettes”), in a manner that
       provides improved retail visibility and some on-street parking. Transform Kern, Mariposa, and
       Merced Malls into enhanced streets with narrow traffic ways, ample sidewalks, stately trees, and on-
       street parking.

   ►   Alternative 3: Restoration and Completion – Keep Fulton Street, Merced Street, Mariposa Street,
       and Kern Street Malls pedestrian-only. Renovate and repair the pedestrian malls in their entirety,
       including their landscape and hardscape, and restore the artwork.

This study analyzes the potential transportation impacts of these three alternatives. From a vehicle
transportation perspective, Alternatives 1 and 2 generate similar traffic conditions by opening Fulton Mall
to vehicular traffic with a narrow two-lane, two-way local serving roadway. Alternative 3 would differ from
Alternatives 1 and 2 by maintaining the pedestrian-only mall. For the purposes of this study,
Alternatives 1 and 2 are referred to as the “Open to Traffic” alternatives and Alternative 3 is referred to as
the “Pedestrian Mall” alternative.

PROJECT TRAFFIC FORECASTS

Trip Generation

The proposed project does not propose any additional traffic generating land uses. The Pedestrian Mall
alternative is not expected to affect traffic volumes.

Since the Open to Traffic alternatives propose narrow, two-way vehicular streets, it is anticipated that the
reintroduced roadways associated with these alternatives would serve existing traffic by providing access
to existing businesses along the pedestrian malls, but would not induce additional travel upon opening.




                                                                                                           23

Traffic Distribution

Open to Traffic Alternatives

The Open to Traffic alternatives may cause some shifts in local traffic patterns by opening the existing
Fulton Mall and its cross streets to vehicle traffic. However, since these alternatives would create narrow,
two-way vehicular streets, these new roadways would primarily carry local trips to access adjacent
businesses. Therefore, these changes in traffic patterns would be localized to roadways in the project
study area.

To evaluate this shift in traffic patterns, a locally validated version of the 2010 Fresno COG TDF model was
used to estimate the re-distribution of traffic in the study area. The Fresno COG TDF model confirmed that
opening Fulton Mall to vehicular traffic would not affect traffic volumes outside the study area. The model
also confirmed that opening the mall to vehicular traffic resulted in minor changes to traffic patterns,
primarily on Fulton Street and parallel facilities, such as Van Ness Avenue.

Pedestrian Mall Alternative

The Pedestrian Mall alternative is not expected to change traffic patterns in the project area as the
transportation infrastructure in the study area would remain the same. Therefore, the traffic volumes for
the Pedestrian Mall alternative would be the same as Baseline Conditions.

Project Effects on Caltrans Facilities

As identified above, the proposed project does not propose any additional traffic generating land uses,
and would only result in minor shifts in traffic patterns adjacent to the existing Fulton Mall with the Open
to Traffic alternatives. The Fresno COG TDF model confirmed that changes in travel patterns associated
with the Open to Traffic alternatives would be localized to the Fulton Mall area, and would not result in
significant changes to traffic on Caltrans facilities.

The Pedestrian Mall alternative would not change traffic patterns, and therefore would also not result in
significant changes to traffic on Caltrans facilities.

Trip Assignment – Open to Traffic Alternatives

The 2010 Fresno COG TDF model was used to assign project traffic to the study intersections and roadway
segments based on the forecasted change in traffic distribution. To account for model error, this study
adjusts project traffic forecasts using a process known as the “difference method,” which adjusts raw
model volume forecasts based on expected incremental growth from Baseline Conditions using the
following formula:

                                Plus Project Forecasts = Baseline Traffic Count +
                       (Plus Project Raw Model Volume – Base Year Raw Model Volume)




                                                                                                         24

TRAFFIC FORECASTS AND ROADWAY OPERATIONS

For the Pedestrian Mall alternative, traffic volumes would remain the same as Baseline Conditions.

For the Mall Open to Traffic alternatives, minor shifts in traffic patterns are expected to occur based on
the traffic distribution and assignment from the Fresno COG TDF model described above.

intersections.

Intersection Operations

For the Pedestrian Mall alternative, intersection operations would remain the same as the Baseline
Conditions.

For the Mall Open to Traffic alternatives, Table 5 summarizes the AM and PM peak hour LOS at the study
intersections (refer to Appendix D for calculations). Figure 7 also shows the peak hour intersection LOS
for the Mall Open to Traffic alternatives. Based on the results in Table 5, all study intersections would
continue to operate at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hour under baseline plus project
conditions with the mall open to traffic alternatives.

           For signalized intersections, the overall average intersection control delay is reported in seconds per vehicle. For side-street stop
          controlled intersections, the average control delay for the movement with the greatest delay is reported in seconds per vehicle.

              Intersection does not exist under Baseline Conditions & Baseline Plus Project Conditions.
          5
           Intersection exists as a pedestrian signal and is not analyzed under Baseline Conditions. Intersection would become fully signalized
          under Baseline Plus Project – Mall Open to Traffic conditions.

CHAPTER 4.                 CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS

This chapter presents the results of the traffic operations analysis for Cumulative Conditions. This scenario
analyzes the proposed project’s incremental effects to traffic and transportation when viewed in
connection with the effects of reasonably foreseeable future projects.

BACKGROUND

As stated in the project purpose section of the NEPA EA and this study, the stated purposes of the
proposed project include maximizing the economic productivity of the Project Area and encourage
development in Downtown Fresno.

Therefore, while the proposed project may not in itself generate new traffic, the project is anticipated to
potentially stimulate and support future development in the Project Area. The Cumulative Conditions
analysis evaluates these potential long-term effects of the proposed project on traffic patterns in the
study area.

PROJECT’S CUMULATIVE EFFECTS

For purposes of this study, the proposed project’s cumulative effects are measured by comparing the
traffic analysis results of Cumulative No Project Conditions to Cumulative Plus Project Conditions. This
analysis evaluates the future traffic conditions with and without the proposed project in order to
understand the cumulative effects of the proposed Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project.

CUMULATIVE YEAR INPUTS

Under Cumulative Conditions, this study uses local and regional planning and funding documents to
identify the reasonably foreseeable changes to the transportation system and development patterns in
the Fresno region. This section describes the land use and transportation inputs used for the Cumulative
(Year 2035) Conditions analysis.

Cumulative Transportation Network Changes

Several changes to the transportation network are anticipated to occur throughout the Fresno region, as
identified in the Fresno COG Regional Transportation Plan, City of Fresno traffic impact fee program nexus
studies, and documents associated with the proposed California High Speed Train project.

Fresno COG 2011 Regional Transportation Plan

The Fresno COG 2011 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) includes a financially constrained list of
transportation projects for which funding has been identified or is reasonably expected to be available
within the RTP planning horizon of 2035. All of these projects are included in the 2035 Fresno COG TDF
model used in this cumulative conditions analysis.




                                                                                                          31
Final Transportation Impact Report
Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project

Most of the projects in the Fresno COG RTP are outside the project area. Of the projects on the financially
constrained project list, the following are in the project vicinity:

    ►    Ventura Avenue: improve to 4-lane divided arterial from SR 41 to SR 99

    ►    BRT starter line on Blackstone Avenue, Ventura Avenue/Kings Canyon Road, and through
         Downtown

Traffic Impact Fee Programs

The City of Fresno assesses traffic impact fees to new development projects to mitigate traffic impacts
through the funding of improvements that help the City maintain adequate levels of service on its
roadway network. Each new development is expected to add to the incremental need for roadway
capacity and each new development would benefit from the new roadway capacity. The City has two
impact fee programs related to traffic: the Fresno Major Streets Impact (FSMI) fee and the Traffic Signal
Mitigation Impact (TSMI) fee.

City of Fresno Major Streets Impact (FMSI) Fee

The FSMI fee funds improvements identified in the Major Street Capital Improvement Program (Major
Street CIP). In the project area, no roadways are listed in the Major Streets CIP.

Traffic Signal Mitigation Impact (TSMI) Fee

The TSMI fee funds traffic signal improvements, including new traffic signals, adding protected left-turn
phasing, and modifications to existing traffic signals. The TSMI Nexus Analysis identifies the following
improvements at the following study intersections:

Downtown Signal Improvements

►   Stanislaus Street / Fulton Street                ►   Tulare Street / Fulton Mall
►   Fresno Street / Fulton Mall                      ►   Ventura Avenue / Van Ness Avenue


Fresno COG Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee (RTMF)

In addition to the City of Fresno’s traffic impact fees, Fresno COG administers the Regional Transportation
Mitigation Fee (RTMF), which was developed to mitigate new development’s indirect regional impacts on
State highway facilities in Fresno County. The fee helps fund improvements needed to maintain the target
LOS in light of higher traffic volumes generated by new developments.

High Speed Rail

The California High Speed Rail Authority is proposing to construct, operate, and maintain an electric-
powered high speed train system in California. In August 2011, the Authority released the Draft
Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the Merced to Fresno and Fresno to Bakersfield project sections.
The DEIR identified several roadway network changes in the City of Fresno, including road closures, new



                                                                                                        32

grade separations, and road realignments. In April 2012, the Authority released the Final EIR for the
Merced to Fresno section, which revised some of the DEIR roadway changes. In Fall 2012, the Authority
circulated a Revised DEIR for the Fresno to Bakersfield segment for public comment.

As of May 2013, the Authority had secured Federal and State funding for an initial construction section in
the Fresno area, and had selected a design-build contractor. This initial construction segment includes the
high speed rail (HSR) trackway through the City of Fresno, from Madera County through Downtown
Fresno. The current schedule indicates that construction would begin in 2014.

As identified in the Merced to Fresno Final EIR and Fresno to Bakersfield DEIR, this construction would
result in several modifications to the local roadway network adjacent to the project area as identified in
Table 7.

Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project
July 2013


Since the initial construction section of HSR trackway in the Fresno area is funded and expected to begin
construction in 2014, these changes to the local circulation system are included in the Cumulative
Conditions analysis as a reasonably foreseeable probable future project.

While the initial construction section in the Fresno area is funded, it is our understanding that the
Authority has only secured funding to construct the trackway from Bakersfield to Merced. The remainder
of the HSR project, including the segments that connect Bakersfield to Los Angeles and from San
Francisco to Merced to create the operational system proposed by the Authority, are not funded.
Furthermore, plans to operate the first phase of the proposed High Speed Train between San Francisco
and Los Angeles/Anaheim are not currently funded.

In addition to the funding limitations, changes to the High Speed Train business plan, projected cost, and
construction schedule generate uncertainty regarding the project description, timing for completing
construction, and beginning operation of the proposed high speed train system. For example, the original
2008 business plan envisioned high speed train service connecting San Francisco and Anaheim by 2020.
However, the November 2011 draft business plan anticipated completion by 2033, which was then revised
in the April 2012 business plan to 2028. While the original plan included high speed trains operating on
dedicated right-of-way between San Francisco and Anaheim, the April 2012 business plan focuses on a
blended system utilizing existing commuter rail right-of-way to lower cost and reduce construction time.
The expected cost to construct the system has also changed, from the estimated $42.5 billion in the
original 2008 business plan to $98.5 billion in the November 2011 draft business plan to $68.4 billion in
the April 2012 business plan.

In light of these changes and lack of funding for the full proposed High Speed Train project, there is
significant uncertainty regarding its ultimate implementation. Therefore, it is currently too speculative to
include the operations of the California High Speed Train system as a reasonably foreseeable future
project for a CEQA or NEPA analysis. As a result, this Cumulative Conditions analysis does not include the
potential increase in traffic associated with passenger demand at a proposed High Speed Train station in
Downtown Fresno as part of a fully functioning statewide High Speed Train system.

Cumulative Land Use Growth

The 2010 release of the Cumulative Fresno COG TDF model uses Fresno COG’s 2035 population and
employment forecasts as land use inputs for future development within the project area and the region.
These land use inputs include projected growth in the Downtown Core, including the proposed project
study area.

The City is also in the process of developing and adopting the Downtown Neighborhoods Community
Plan (DNCP) and Fulton Corridor Specific Plan (FCSP). These plans would shape development and
transportation in Downtown Fresno and its surrounding neighborhoods.

It is expected the development changes and transportation improvements associated with the DNCP and
FCSP would ultimately occur with or without the proposed Fulton Mall Reconstruction Project. Therefore,
the Cumulative Conditions analysis includes the development potential and transportation improvements
associated with these plans for both the No Project and Plus Project analysis.


                                                                                                         34

CUMULATIVE NO PROJECT CONDITIONS

The Cumulative No Project conditions analysis reflects anticipated conditions without the proposed Fulton
Mall Reconstruction Project. This includes the cumulative transportation and land use development
changes identified above, including projected development within the project area consistent with the
DNCP and FCSP.

Cumulative No Project Forecasting

Cumulative (Year 2035) No Project weekday peak hour traffic volume forecasts were developed using a
locally validated version of the Fresno COG travel demand forecasting (TDF) model. The model uses the
land use and transportation inputs described above to provide travel demand forecasts for the AM and
PM peak hours.

Similar to the Baseline Plus Project travel demand modeling, the Cumulative No Project turning
movement forecasts were developed using the “difference method.” This approach adjusts raw model
volume forecasts based on expected incremental growth from Baseline Conditions using the following
formula:

                        Cumulative No Project Forecasts = Baseline Traffic Count +
                    (Cumulative No Project Model Volume – Base Year Raw Model Volume)

Figure 8 shows the peak hour Cumulative No Project turning movement forecasts at the study
intersections.

Intersection Operations

Table 8 summarizes the AM and PM peak hour level of service (LOS) at each study intersection under
Cumulative No Project conditions (refer to Appendix F for calculations). Figure 9 also shows the peak
hour intersection LOS. Based on the results in Table 8, the following five intersections would operate at
LOS E or F during the AM and/or PM peak hour under Cumulative No Project conditions:

►   Stanislaus Street / Broadway                   ►   Fresno Street / Van Ness Avenue
►   Tuolumne Street / Broadway                     ►   Ventura Avenue / H Street
►   Fresno Street / H Street

All of these intersections are located within the Core Area, defined as the area bounded by State Routes
99, 41, and 180 in Fulton Corridor Specific Plan policy 9-3-1. Per the City of Fresno’s General Plan policy
MT-1-m, LOS E and F operations are acceptable at City of Fresno intersections within the Downtown
Neighborhoods Community Plan area and the Fulton Corridor Specific Plan area. Therefore, all
intersections are considered to operate at an acceptable level of service.

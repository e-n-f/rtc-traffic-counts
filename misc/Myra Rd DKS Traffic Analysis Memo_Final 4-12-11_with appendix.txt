SE Myra Road is currently a four to five lane roadway with leftturn bays at major intersections and 
sidewalks along most of its entire length. The posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour (mph) from SR 
125 to just north of Dalles Military Road, after which it increases to 35 mph. On the south section 
from Garrison Village Way to SR 125, SE Myra Road has one northbound lane, two southbound 
lanes, and leftturn lanes at the Dalles Military Road and SR 125 intersections (i.e., fourlane cross
section). This southern section of SE Myra Road currently serves approximately 9,000 vehicles1 per 
day, but traffic volumes are expected to increase significantly with future development. 

The primary intersection on the southern section of SE Myra Road is at Dalles Military Road. Dalles 
Military Road (and its continuation as 12th Avenue) provides a key travel route between the City of 
Walla Walla and the City of College Place as a parallel facility to SR 125. It serves approximately 
6,500 vehicles2 per day and is located on the edge of bluff. This bluff contributes to steep grades on 
SE Myra Road both to the north and the south of Dalles Military Road. Additional discussion of 
these roadway grades is provided later in this memorandum. 

Because of the increased traffic on SE Myra Road and the regional importance of SE Myra Road as a 
truck route and bypass between US 12 and SR 125, the City of Walla Walla and the City of College 
Place are working together to determine whether future improvements are needed on the 
southern section of the SE Myra Road corridor, particularly at the Dalles Military Road intersection. 
Prior city efforts have identified a gradeseparation concept that would have SE Myra Road pass 
underneath Dalles Military Road (due to the area's current topography) with turn movements 
between the two facilities provided using a loop road in the undeveloped lot on the intersection's 
northwest corner. However, no specific analysis work has been performed to determine whether 
grade separation is necessary or if it is the preferred alternative. Furthermore, no studies have been 
performed using traffic counts collected since the SE Myra Road extension to SR 125 was 
constructed. Therefore, prior analysis was based on rerouting assumptions to anticipate the traffic 
diversion caused by the new connection between US 12 and SR 125. Now that the new connection 
is in operation, future projections can be based on observed traffic volumes. 

The purpose of this memorandum is to evaluate the existing roadway crosssection and intersection 
geometries on the southern section of the SE Myra Road corridor to determine whether the current 
roadway can support 20year growth. The findings of this memorandum will provide important 
information to assist the City of Walla Walla and the City of College Place in intelligently planning 
future improvements in this area.

Roadway Grades
Roadway grades on SE Myra Road near the Dalles Military Road intersection were evaluated by 
Anderson Perry and Associates. A detailed discussion of existing geometric elements, vertical 
alignment, and horizontal alignment are provided in their memorandum, which is included in the 
appendix.3 Key findings include the following: 
              The vertical grade (slope) of SE Myra Road south of the intersection is approximately 5.2 
              percent. North of the intersection it is approximately 4.8 percent. 
              Both the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)4 
              AASHTO and the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)5 have 
              general recommendations with regard to maximum grades on roads at intersections. 
              AASHTO recommends avoiding grades in excess of 3.0 percent on intersecting roads (but 
              where conditions make such designs too expensive, grades should not exceed 6.0 percent). 
              WSDOT guidelines say that in areas that experience accumulations of snow and ice, the 
              design maximum grade should not exceed approximately 4.0 percent for a length equal to 
              the anticipated queuing length of the stopped vehicles for all legs of an intersection that 
              require traffic to stop. After approximately four cars are queued in lanes on SE Myra Road, 
              the grade of the road exceeds the AASHTO and WSDOT recommended standards. 
              The SE Myra Road vertical curve provides the minimum required stopping sight distance for 
              speeds up to 35 mph. If the posted speed limit was increased to greater than 35 mph or if 
              the decision sight distance requirements are utilized, then the roadway would not meet 
              guidelines. Stopping sight distance is the distance needed for a driver to detect an 
              unexpected information source or roadway condition and then brake to a complete stop 
              (distance traveled during reaction time plus breaking distance). Decision sight distance is 
              the distance needed for a driver to detect an unexpected information source or roadway 
              condition and then select and safely complete an appropriate maneuver (distance traveled 
              during reaction time plus maneuvering distance). 

Therefore, current grades on SE Myra Road approaching the Dalles Military Road intersection are 
steeper than recommended, particularly during snow and ice conditions and when queues extend 
beyond four cars. As discussed later in this memorandum, future congestion is expected at the SE 
Myra Road/Dalles Military Road intersection by the year 2032, which will likely lead to queues of 
more than four cars on the SE Myra Road approaches to this intersection.

Existing Traffic Operations
Existing traffic operations were evaluated along the southern section of the SE Myra Road corridor 
at four study intersections: 
              SR 125/SE Myra Road 
              SE Myra Road/SE Commercial Drive/Twin Creek Lane 
              SE Myra Road/Dalles Military Road 
              SE Myra Road/SE Garrison Village Way 

Numerous studies in recent years have evaluated traffic conditions prior to the construction of the 
SE Myra Road extension to US 12; however, this is the first evaluation since the north extension 
project was completed. The following sections address existing traffic volumes, applicable level of 
service standards, the existing 2011 operations, and queuing observations. 

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic counts were performed during the p.m. peak hour (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) on March 15, 
2011.6 Figure 1 shows the existing 2011 p.m. peak hour traffic volumes along with the study 
intersection lane geometries and traffic control. Compared with traffic volumes prior to the 
completion of the SE Myra Road extension to US 12, these new volumes suggest the following: 
              There has been a slight shift in traffic away from the through movements on SR 125 to the 
              southbound rightturn and eastbound leftturn movements at SE Myra Road. Approximately 
              120 vehicles during the p.m. peak hour now use SE Myra Road rather than SR 125. It is likely 
              this shift is due to the new connection to US 12. 
              Traffic volumes on SR 125 are lower than they were a few years ago, which is likely due to a 
              change in driving characteristics over the past few years due to the economy as well as the 
              US 12 improvements on the north end of the urban area, among other circulation changes.

Applicable Level of Service Standards
The study intersections are required to meet city and state level of service standards based on the 
intersection jurisdiction. Table 1 lists the applicable level of service standards, which are described 
as follows: 
              The City of Walla Walla level of service standards vary slightly based on intersection type.7 
              Specifically, for signalized intersections, LOS D is acceptable. For unsignalized intersections, 
              LOS D is acceptable for all critical movements on arterial or collector roadways and LOS E is 
              acceptable for all critical movements on local roadways. In addition, the guidelines have an 
              additional requirement that certain roadways (including SE Myra Road) operate at LOS C for 
              the throughmovements. 
              The Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT) also has level of service standards 
              that must also be met by state facilities.8 SR 125 is a Highway of Statewide Significance 
              (HSS), and the SR 125/SE Myra Road intersection is in an urban area; therefore, the 
              applicable intersection standard for this study intersection is LOS D.

Existing Operations
Existing 2011 p.m. peak hour operating conditions at the four study intersections were determined 
using the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology9 for signalized and unsignalized 
intersections. Existing roadway grades on the SE Myra Road approaches were included in the HCM 
analysis to account for increased delay experienced by trucks as they attempt to accelerate on the 
upgrades. Table 2 shows the average delay, level of service (LOS), and volume to capacity (v/c) ratio 
of each study intersection. As shown, all intersections currently meet applicable City of Walla Walla 
and WSDOT level of service standards.

Queuing Observations
Queues on Myra Road at the northbound approach of the Dalles Military Road intersection were 
observed during the peak 15 minute period. On this approach, there were queues of two to five 
vehicles. Therefore, even under existing conditions, there are existing queues that exceed the four
vehicle threshold and extend into the roadway section where grades are a concern for heavy 
vehicles (as previously discussed in the Roadway Grades section). 


Future No-Build Traffic Operations
Future nobuild traffic operations were analyzed for the southern section of SE Myra Road from 
Garrison Village Way to SR 125. The purpose of the analysis was to assess how SE Myra Road would 
operate based on the current geometry at the Dalles Military Road intersection in order to 
determine whether the current geometry can support 20year growth. The following sections 
address future traffic volumes, future nobuild operations, and the expected impacts from the 
extension of SE Myra Road south from SR 125 to Taumarson Road. 

Future Traffic Volumes
Future traffic volumes for the 2012 and 2032 horizon year were estimated by applying a 1.5 percent 
background growth rate to the existing traffic volumes and then adding traffic from conceptual 
nearby developments. The background growth and nearby development traffic assumptions used 
for the forecasts are documented in a prior memorandum provided to the City of Walla Walla and 
the City of College Place.10 Figure 2 shows the 2012 and 2032 future traffic volume forecasts. It also 
shows the results of the 2032 operations analysis, which is discussed later in this memorandum. 
Particular emphasis is placed on the high congestion movements, which are indicated by the red 
arrows.

A review of the overall traffic volume growth on the study area roadways indicates that, in 2032, 
future traffic volumes are expected to increase substantially compared with existing volumes. The 
majority of this growth would be due to the new commercial and residential developments along 
the corridor. Table 3 lists the traffic growth on the study area roadways between 2011 and 2032. As 
shown, the most significant growth would occur on SE Myra Road, where traffic volumes would 
nearly triple over the 21 years. Although these growth forecasts are substantial, they are lower than 
other historical transportation studies.11 These historical studies included traffic estimates for the 
SE Myra Road extension south from SR 125 to Taumarson Road but were also based on counts 
collected prior to the completion of the SE Myra Road extension to US 12.

Another instructive growth comparison is the increase in total entering vehicles (TEV) during the 
p.m. peak hour at the study intersections. Table 4 lists the TEV growth between 2011 and 2032. As 
shown, p.m. peak hour traffic volumes at the Commercial Drive and Garrison Village Way 
intersections are expected to increase nearly fourfold due to the combination of new development 
along these roads and higher volumes on SE Myra Road. The p.m. peak hour traffic volumes at the 
SR 125 and Dalles Military Road intersections are also expected to increase substantially.

Future No-Build Operations (Existing Geometry)
Future p.m. peak hour traffic analysis was performed for 2012 and 2032 to evaluate the expected 
performance under nobuild conditions (i.e., the existing SE Myra Road geometry). The operations 
were determined using 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology12 for signalized and 
unsignalized intersections. Table 5 shows the average delay, level of service (LOS), and volume to 
capacity (v/c) ratio of each study intersection for the two horizon years. As shown, all intersections 
are expected to meet the City of Walla Walla and WSDOT level of service standards in 2012; 
however, two of the four study intersections would exceed standards in 2032.

As mentioned previously, Figure 2 shows the results of the 2032 operations analysis along with the 
2012 and 2032 future traffic volume forecasts. The high congestion movements (i.e., those that 
would operate at an LOS E or F or would have a v/c ratio greater than 1.0) in 2032 are indicated by 
the red arrows. As shown, nearly all movements at the Dalles Military Road intersection and all 
movements on the SE Garrison Village Way side street approaches are expected to experience 
significant congestion if no improvements are made to the existing intersection geometry. In 
addition, because there is no northbound leftturn pocket, the leftturning vehicles (270 vehicles in 
2032) must wait in the leftmost throughlane until there is a sufficient gap in southbound traffic;

this is likely to cause queuing and reduce the efficiency of the northbound lanes. In addition, 
congestion is expected on SR 125 at the eastbound leftturn and westbound through movements, 
which are the critical conflicting movements at this intersection. These movements on SR 125 are 
approaching capacity limits; however, this intersection will operate at an overall acceptable LOS D. 

Future No-Build Queuing Analysis
Future queuing analysis was performed for the study intersections to identify potential queuing 
impacts caused by the increased congestion on Myra Road. The analysis was performed for the p.m. 
peak hour under the future 2012 and 2032 scenarios. SimTrafficTM was used to estimate the 95th 
percentile queues, which are the queue length at a given intersection movement that has only a 5% 
chance of being exceeded during the peak traffic hour. It is standard engineering practice base 
queuing analysis on the 95th percentile queues. 

Table 6 lists the queuing results. One of the movements of greatest concern is the northbound 
approach to Dalles Military Road. As shown in the table, queues in 2012 are expected to equal 
approximately 150 feet (or six vehicles) and queues in 2032 are expected to equal 300 feet (or 12 
vehicles). Both of these queue lengths exceed the fourvehicle threshold (as discussed in the 
Roadway Grades section) and extend into the roadway section where grades are a concern for 
heavy vehicles. In addition, southbound queues at SR 125 are expected to extend to the 
Commercial Drive/Twin Creek Lane intersection by the year 2032.

Expected Impacts from SE Myra Road South Extension
The analysis documented previously in this memorandum does not include the potential additional 
future traffic that would be attracted to SE Myra Road should it be extended south from SR 125 to 
Taumarson Road. This potential SE Myra Road extension to the south may increase p.m. peak hour

                                                                                                 April 12, 2011

bidirectional traffic volumes on this section of Myra Road by approximately 500 vehicles (i.e., a 25 
percent increase).13 Because the Dalles Military Road and Garrison Village Way intersections are 
already projected to exceed the City's level of service standards, this level of additional traffic would 
significantly increase congestion, further degrading operations on SE Myra Road. The likely result 
would be additional improvement needs. 

To fully evaluate the impacts of the southern SE Myra Road extension on the corridor, additional 
traffic analysis is recommended. This analysis should forecast future volumes by utilizing a travel 
demand model, such as the one prepared by the BentonFranklinWalla Walla Regional 
Transportation Planning Organization (RTPO). Regional travel demand modeling is recommended to 
more accurately estimate the volume rerouting that would occur due to the regional significance 
that this new connection would provide. It is also expected to better account for the development 
potential that exists in the southern portion of the urban area. 


Summary
This memorandum documents how the section of SE Myra Road from SE Garrison Village Way to SR 
125 would operate based on the current geometry at Dalles Military Road. The analyses included 
traffic operations and queuing, and indicated that two study intersections would exceed operating 
standards under 2032 forecasted conditions: 
              SE Myra Road/Dalles Military Road 
              SE Myra Road/SE Garrison Village Way 

In addition, queuing concerns were identified on Myra Road at the northbound approach to the 
Dalles Military Road intersection. The roadway grades evaluation indicates that once queues exceed 
four vehicles, then heavy vehicles at the back of the queue will be required to accelerate on grades 
that are steeper than recommended. Currently, queues of approximately five vehicles have been 
observed at this approach and so already extend past the recommended threshold. In 2012, queues 
are expected to increase to six vehicles, and in 2032, queues of 12 vehicles are expected. Therefore, 
the queuing concerns will only worsen. 

Without doing additional alternatives analysis, specific improvement needs at these two 
intersections cannot be determined. However, it is likely that the SE Garrison Village Way 
intersection would require a traffic signal with multiple turn lanes. In fact, the installation of a traffic 
signal and the addition of turn lanes at this intersection has been previously identified as an 
improvement need triggered by the Villages of Garrison Creek Planned Unit Development (PUD).14

of Transportation (WSDOT)2 design criteria. This memo will present the findings. The first
section will summarize the existing vertical and horizontal elements found at the intersection.
These elements are also shown on Figure 1. The second section will discuss how the existing
vertical elements compare to the AASHTO and WSDOT design criteria. The third section will
discuss how the existing horizontal elements compare to the AASHTO and WSDOT design
criteria. The final section will provide a brief summary of the findings.

Existing Geometric Elements

1.    The current posted speed limit north of the intersection is 35 mph and the posted speed
      limit between the intersection and Highway 125 to the south is 25 mph. The operational
      speed (85th Percentile Speed Study) of the roadway was not determined.
2.    There is a vertical curve in Myra Road that crests at the intersection with Dalles
      Military Road. The length of the vertical curve as measured from the design survey is
      approximately 400 feet. There is no vertical curve in Dalles Military Road through the
      intersection.
3.    The vertical grade (slope) of Myra Road south of the intersection is approximately
      5.2 percent. North of the intersection it is approximately 4.8 percent. Dalles Military Road
      slopes from east to west at approximately 1.2 percent through the intersection.
4.    There is a separate right-turn pocket on the southwesterly corner of the intersection turning
      off of Dalles Military Road onto Myra Road toward Highway 125 with an approximate
      turning radius of 90 feet. This turning lane was installed to avoid the high voltage power
      transmission pole. The other three corners have curb radii ranging from 20 to 30 feet. See
      Figure 1 for specific radii lengths.
5.    There is a horizontal bend in Myra Road of approximately 4 degrees at the intersection
      with Dalles Military Road. There is no bend in Dalles Military Road as it intersects with
      Myra Road. The south leg of Myra intersects Dalles Military Road at approximately
      90 degrees.

Vertical Alignment Discussion
As previously noted, Myra Road crosses Dalles Military Road on the crest of vertical curve.
There are two sight distance design criteria related to the vertical curve that we looked at. These
include stopping sight distance and decision sight distance.

Sight distance is the length of the roadway ahead that is visible to the driver. Stopping sight
distance is the sum of two distances; 1) the distance traveled by the vehicle from the instant the
driver sights an object necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes are applied (brake reaction
time), and 2) the distance needed to stop the vehicle from the instant the brakes application
begins (breaking distance). Decision site distance is the distance needed for a driver to detect an
unexpected or otherwise difficult to perceive information source or condition in the roadway
environment and to then select an appropriate speed path and initiate and complete the maneuver
safely.

The sight distance on Myra Road approaching the intersection was measured and compared with
the AASHTO Design Vehicle and Obstacle Height Criteria. The actual stopping distance using
the existing vertical curve length and grade is 292 feet. The AASHTO guidelines recommend a
stopping sight distance of approximately 162 feet for a 25 mph speed limit, 266 feet for a 35 mph
speed limit and 326 feet for a 40 mph speed limit. Each of these distances are based on downhill
grades which are slightly longer than for uphill grades. The decision sight distances using urban
roads without a stop are 490 feet for 25 mph, 720 for 35 mph, and 825 feet for 40 mph. For an
urban road with a stop the recommended decision sight distances are 395 feet for 25 mph, 590
for 35 mph, and 690 for 40 mph. The WSDOT values are almost identical to the AASHTO
values.

The Myra Road vertical curve provides the minimum required stopping sight distance for speeds
up to 35 mph. If the posted speed limit was increased to greater than 35 mph or if the decision
sight distance requirements are utilized, then the roadway would not meet guidelines.

Both AASHTO and WSDOT have some general recommendations with regard to maximum
grades on roads at intersections. AASHTO recommends avoiding grades in excess of 3 percent
on intersecting roads. The recommendation goes on to say where conditions make such designs
too expensive, grades should not exceed 6 percent. WSDOT guidelines say that in areas that
experience accumulations of snow and ice the design maximum grade should be approximately
4 percent for a length equal to the anticipated queuing length of the stopped vehicles for all legs
of an intersection that require traffic to stop. After approximately 4 cars are queued in lanes on
Myra Road, the grade of the road exceeds the AASHTO and WSDOT recommended standards.

Horizontal Alignment Discussion
The horizontal alignments of the two streets at the intersection create angles that are within
4 degrees of being 90 degrees. This is well within all established standards. There are no
obvious sight restrictions while stopped at the intersection. The existing curb radii are adequate
for cars, and small trucks at all four corners. The AASHTO Manual provides the required
turning radius for a wide variety of sizes and types of vehicles. Most of the buses and trucks
addressed by the manual are not going to be able to make the right turns at the northwest,

northeast, and southeast corners without driving over the curb and/or encroaching into a second
lane.

Summary

        The existing sight distance on Myra Road meets the stopping site distance standard at the
        posted speed. The standard would not be met with a 40 mph limit.

        The existing sight distance on Myra Road does not meet the decision sight distance
        standard.

        There are no sight distance issues with Dalles Military Road.

        The grade (slope) on Myra Road is steeper than recommended standards for streets with
        required stops once you get four or more vehicles queued in lanes.

        The horizontal alignment meets standards.

        The curb radii are smaller than design standards for a significant number of vehicles
        making right turns at the northwest, northeast, and southeast legs of the intersection.

     SUBJECT:              Myra Road Traffic Growth Forecasts                                      P11031-000


     This memorandum summarizes growth assumptions and future year 2012 and 2032 traffic projections
     on the southern section of Myra Road that borders the City of Walla Walla and the City of College
     Place. Myra Road is a key arterial, is an attractive location for future development, and was recently
     extended north to US 12 to provide an alternative connection for trucks and passenger vehicles
     between US 12 and SR 125 (in November 2008). Because of the increased traffic and steep grades on
     the south end of Myra Road near SR 125, both agencies are working together to determine future
     improvement needs. The traffic volume forecasts in this memorandum will be used in a subsequent
     memorandum that will evaluate future operating conditions along this section of Myra Road. The
     subsequent memorandum will also provide a more detailed discussion about Myra Road.

     This memorandum documents the existing 2011 traffic volumes and projected future traffic volumes
     for 2012 and 2032 (including the associated traffic forecast assumptions).

     Existing 2011 Traffic
     Existing traffic counts were performed during the p.m. peak hour (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) on March 15,
     2011, at four intersections on Myra Road:
                Myra Road/Garrison Village Way
                Myra Road/Dalles Military Road
                Myra Road/Commercial Drive/Twin Creek Lane
                Myra Road/SR 125

     Figure 1 shows the existing traffic volumes at these four intersections along with the intersection lane
     geometries and traffic control. Detailed two-hour counts are included in the appendix.

Future 2012 and 2032 Traffic
Future traffic volumes for 2012 and 2032 were estimated by applying a background growth rate to the
existing traffic volumes as well as adding traffic from potential nearby developments. Both the
background growth and nearby development traffic assumptions were based primarily on a review of
prior traffic studies. A summary of key information from each study is provided in the appendix. These
prior studies followed future forecasting methodologies that included estimating background growth
using a yearly growth rate and then adding additional traffic from "pipeline" projects that were
considered likely to develop by the future horizon year. The background growth rate and potential
nearby developments now being assumed for the 2012 and 2032 volume forecasts are documented in
the following sections.

Background Growth Rate
The intent of the background growth rate is to capture regional growth as well as other potential
developments not specifically identified. The background growth rate considered appropriate for Myra
Road and the other roadway approaches is a 1.5% yearly linear growth rate. This rate is consistent with
the prior traffic studies and is expected to adequately capture 20 years of regional growth as well as
growth from areas outside the study area. Any higher growth rate would likely overestimate future
2032 background traffic volumes because the forecast is long-term and trips will be added separately
from the specific developments adjacent to this corridor.

Potential nearby Developments
There are multiple sites along the southern section of Myra Road (i.e. south of Rose Street) where
potential future development has been previously identified. Traffic from these developments was
routed south on Myra Road through the study intersections based on information provided in prior
traffic studies. City of Walla Walla staff 1 and City of College Place staff 2 also provided helpful
information related to the prior traffic studies. Table 1 lists the specific developments along with their
size, source for trip generation estimates, and p.m. peak hour trips. Figure 2 (provided later in this
memorandum) shows the location of each development. The only developments assumed to be
constructed and in operation by the year 2012 are the bank/office and car dealership on Commercial
Drive. Otherwise, the remaining developments are assumed to be constructed by the year 2032.

      Trip generation estimates were either based on a prior study or new estimates were performed using ITE rates.
    b
      Net-new p.m. peak hour trips are listed in this table, but only a portion of the total trips were routed through the study
      intersections. Pass-by trips are also provided in instance where they affect study intersections.
    c
      The bank/office is built and about to open and the car dealership is under construction. These two developments are
      assumed to be occupied by the 2012 horizon year. The remaining land uses are assumed to be constructed by
      2032.
    d
      KSF = 1,000 square feet
    e
      The Blue Mountain Mall currently has 118.6 KSF of occupied space (Shopko, Sears, and Pizza Hut). Future
      development plans include full build-out of 300 KSF; therefore, the vacant or yet to be constructed area is 181.4
      KSF.




Total 2012 and 2032 Future Traffic
Total traffic volumes for the years 2012 and 2032 were estimated by factoring up the existing traffic
volumes by the background growth rate and then adding traffic from the potential nearby
developments documented previously. One year of background growth and traffic from the bank and
auto dealership on Commercial Drive were added to existing 2011 volumes to obtain the 2012 volume
forecasts, and 21 years of background growth and all identified developments were added to the
existing 2011 volumes to obtain the 2032 volume forecasts. Figure 2 shows the future 2012 and 2032
traffic volumes at the four Myra Road intersections. It also shows the existing lane configurations that
will be assumed for the future no-build analysis in the subsequent memorandum. The locations of
potential nearby developments and the background growth rate are also shown in Figure 2.

Summary
Future traffic volumes for 2012 and 2032 were estimated by applying a background growth rate to the
existing traffic volumes and then adding traffic from potential nearby developments. These volumes
will be used to perform future no-build analysis in a subsequent memorandum.

In addition to the 2012 and 2032 no-build analysis, a sensitivity analysis will be performed for the year
2032 to determine what affect the Myra Road extension south to Taumarson Road may have on the
no-build analysis. Rough 2032 traffic volume estimates at the four Myra Road intersections that may
result from the extension will be made based on prior work performed for the Walla Walla
Commercial Rezone Traffic Impact Analysis. 3 This additional traffic is only being considered for a
sensitivity analysis to test how the Myra Road south extension may affect volumes on Myra Road north
of SR 125. If the City desires to evaluate full roadway alternatives assuming this roadway extension,
then regional travel demand modeling is recommended to more accurately estimate volume rerouting
that would occur due to the regional significance that this new connection would provide to the
existing area and potential development to the south. There would likely be significant rerouting, and
the importance of Myra Road as a connection to both SR 125 and US 12 would be significantly
increased.

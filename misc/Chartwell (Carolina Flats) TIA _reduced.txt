1.0   INTRODUCTION


The subject development is the Carolina Flats at Estes and is proposed to be located in the northeast
quadrant of the intersection of Estes Drive and Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina. This report presents the traffic operations impacts of this new development on the study area
roads.

The proposed development would include approximately 189 student apartment units as well as a 145
room hotel. This development would have access through two driveways as described below:

        Driveway #1 with full ingress/egress on Estes Drive east of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard
        Driveway #2 with right-in, right-out ingress/egress on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, north of
        Estes Drive

The proposed development would be built by 2014 and the build analysis year for this report is 2015,
one year after the construction is complete. Figure 1 shows the site plan of the proposed development.

1.1   Project Overview

The plan proposes to build approximately 189 units of student units as well as a 145 room hotel, which
is expected to be completed by 2014. The site is located in the Town of Chapel Hill’s Single Family (R-1)
zoning district, as shown on Figure 2. The proposed zoning is Multi-Family (MU-V).

1.2   Site Location and Study Area

To determine the traffic impacts of the proposed site development on nearby roadways, traffic flow
conditions were analyzed at the following seven intersections:

        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard/Piney Mountain Road/Municipal Drive (existing four-leg
        signalized intersection)
        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard/Shadowood Drive (existing three-leg unsignalized intersection)
        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard/Driveway #2 (proposed three-leg unsignalized intersection)
        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard/Estes Drive (existing four-leg signalized intersection)
        Estes Drive/Driveway #1 (proposed three-leg unsignalized intersection)
        Estes Drive/Somerset Drive (existing three-leg unsignalized intersection)
        Estes Drive/Caswell Road/Clayton Road (existing four-leg signalized intersection)

1.3   Existing and Proposed Uses in Site Vicinity

The project site is surrounded by residential zoning to the east and north and Institutional zoning to the
west and south. The proposed development would be located on currently undeveloped land (currently
used as a certified tree farm) and compose approximately 189 student apartment units and a 145 room
hotel.

   2.0   2012 EXISTING CONDITIONS


   The Existing Conditions capacity analysis included peak hour arterial capacity analysis and peak hour
   intersection capacity analysis.

   2.1   Arterial Capacity Analysis

   Arterial capacity analyses were performed for the following two segments:

                Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard between Timber Hollow Court and Airport Drive
                Estes Drive between Airport Drive and Halifax Road

   The 2012 Existing Conditions arterial capacity analysis on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes
   Drive was performed using the peak hour traffic volumes per direction obtained from the traffic counts
   performed for this study. Using these traffic volumes and capacity thresholds for the respective
   roadway type obtained from Chapel Hill Guidelines for Traffic Impact Analysis, Volume-to-Capacity ratios
   were calculated for the study area roads.

   The 2012 arterial capacity analysis indicates that the traffic demand along Martin Luther King, Jr.
   Boulevard and Estes Drive approach or exceed the roadway capacity limits (volume-to-capacity ratio of
   greater than 0.9) during at least one peak hour of the day, indicating a need for additional roadway
   improvements.

   Table 1 shows the results of the arterial capacity analysis for the 2012 Existing Conditions.

2.2   Peak Hour Intersection Capacity Analysis

Peak hour intersection capacity analyses were performed for the following intersections:
            Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at Piney Mountain Road/Municipal Drive
            Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at Shadowood Road
            Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at Estes Drive
            Estes Drive at Somerset Drive
            Estes Drive at Caswell Road/Clayton Road

As the highest traffic demand on area roads usually occurs during AM and PM peak hours with an
additional peak hour due to lunch-time traffic volumes, traffic counts were analyzed for the following
time periods: between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM, and 4:00 and 6:00 PM. Traffic counts
were conducted on Tuesday, April 24, 2012 at these study intersections. The peak hour is defined as the
highest four continuous 15-minute traffic count intervals. Based on the traffic counts collected for the
above five intersections, the peak hours for the analysis are as follows:

            AM Peak Hour: 7:45 AM – 8:45 AM;
            Mid-day Peak Hour: 12:15 PM – 1:15 PM;
            PM Peak Hour: 4:45 PM – 5:45 PM.

Figure 3 shows the 2012 intersection turning-movement counts for the weekday AM, Mid-day, and PM
peak hours.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Piney Mountain Road/Municipal Road: The signalized
intersection capacity analysis at Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Piney Mountain Road/Municipal
Road, indicates that this intersection on the whole operates Level of Service B or better, very good rate
of traffic flow, during the peak hours. The northbound and southbound approaches function without
any delay at Level of Service A during the peak hours. The eastbound approach of Municipal Road and
westbound approach of Piney Mountain Road exceed capacity limits (Level of Service F) during the peak
hours. However, the volume-to-capacity ratio for the two approaches is less than 0.7, indicating a good
rate of traffic flow. The poor Level of Service is a result of longer cycle length, which is required to
maintain progression along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Shadowood Drive: At the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard and Shadowood Drive, the unsignalized intersection capacity analysis indicates the
westbound stop controlled left operates at Level of Service B or better, a very good rate of flow.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive: The signalized intersection capacity analysis at
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive indicates that this intersection on the whole operates
at Level of Service D or better, an acceptable rate of flow during the peak hours. The northbound and
southbound approaches function at Level of Service D or better, an acceptable rate of flow, during the
peak hours with one exception. The exception is traffic demand along the southbound approach, flows
at a Level of Service E, (approaching roadway capacity limits) during PM Peak Hour. The eastbound and
westbound approaches of Estes Drive either approach or exceed the roadway capacity limits (Level of
Service E or F) during the peak hours.

Estes Drive and Somerset Road: At the intersection of Estes Drive and Somerset Road, the unsignalized
intersection capacity analysis indicates all stop controlled movements operate at Level of Service D or
better, an acceptable rate of flow during the peak hours.

Estes Drive and Caswell Road/Clayton Road: The signalized intersection capacity analysis at Estes Drive
and Caswell Road/Clayton Road indicates that all approaches operate at Level of Service C or better, a
good rate of flow during the peak hours.

Table 2 summarizes the intersection capacity analyses for the 2012 Existing Conditions. Figure 3
presents the results of the 2012 Existing Conditions analysis graphically.

3.0   FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WITHOUT PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT


Future traffic flow conditions without the proposed Carolina Flats at Estes are analyzed to provide a
benchmark from which the effects of the proposed project’s impacts can be measured. This scenario is
called the No Build Conditions. The future analysis year is projected to be 2015: one year after Carolina
Flats at Estes is expected to be completed and fully occupied.

The No Build Conditions traffic projections include traffic generated by all other development projects in
the area that are already approved but not yet built. The Town of Chapel Hill identified the following
developments to be included in this analysis:

         Shortbread Loft development
         UNC-Chapel Hill Main Campus Development Plan
         Orange United Methodist Church Expansion
         Carolina North Development
         Parking Lot #5

The Shortbread Lofts Developments is located on Rosemary Street between Roberson Street and
Church Street in Chapel Hill. This development would replace the existing 3,550 square feet of office
space and 22 apartment units with 5,545 square feet of retail space, 104 apartments and a private
parking lot with 48 spaces.

The UNC-Chapel Hill Main Campus Development Plan will add approximately 7.9 million gross square
feet (GSF) of new development to the campus, including parking decks and infrastructure. The net
increase in new occupied floor area is approximately 5.6 million square feet, or an estimated 49 percent
increase over pre-2001 occupied floor area. As with the previous update, the growth projections used to
estimate employee and student growth have been extended through 2015. Employee growth is
anticipated to be 31 percent (4,497 additional employees) and student growth is anticipated to be 18
percent (4,575 additional students) over the life of the Development Plan.

The Orange United Methodist Church is located at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard
(NC 86) and Homestead Road in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The expansion will include adding 660 seats
to the existing sanctuary, 34 students to the existing daycare and a Family Life Center. Access will be
through one full access driveway and one exit driveway on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard.

The Carolina North Development is a new expansion project located in the northwest quadrant of the
intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at Estes Drive. The development consists of 260,000
square feet of research facilities. Access to the site will be primarily through the intersection of Piney
Mountain Road at Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard.

The Parking Lot #5 is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of Rosemary Street with
Church Street. The Parking Lot #5 will replace 165 parking spaces with 396 parking spaces serving 151
residential dwelling units and 24,621 square feet of retail space, as well as continuing to provide public
parking.

3.1     Background Traffic

The No Build or background traffic assignment is a two-step process. First, the 2012 existing traffic on
area roads was increased by a growth rate of 1.50 percent per year for three years to obtain future
background traffic volumes1. Second, traffic generated by other development projects that have not yet
been completed was added to the background traffic. Traffic for the approved development projects is
estimated as follows.

Trip Generation: The AM, Mid-day, and PM Peak Hour trips generated by all developments included in
the analysis were obtained from their respective Traffic Impact Analysis Reports (TIAs). The trips
generated by each of these developments are shown in Table 3.

Trip Distribution: The traffic distribution for the development projects was obtained from the respective
TIAs.

Modal Split: Although there are bus routes on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive, this
study conservatively assumes that all background site travel is via auto. Any transit travel generated by
other development projects would decrease the number of auto trips and improve the traffic conditions
projected by this study.

Trip Assignment: Off-site traffic is assigned to area roads using the trip distribution described in the
traffic studies cited above. The trip assignments traffic diagrams for all the above mentioned
developments are included in the technical appendix - Trip Assignment for Other Developments.


Figure 4 illustrates the No Build Conditions.

4.0   PROPOSED PROJECT TRAFFIC


The proposed development is located in the northeast quadrant of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard
and Estes Drive intersection in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The proposed development would include
approximately 189 student apartment units and a 145 room hotel with a completion date of 2014. The
proposed development would not replace any current development.

Site Access: There are two driveways for the proposed development as described below:

        Driveway #1 with full access/egress on Estes Drive east of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard
        Driveway #2 with right in/right out access/egress on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard north of
        Estes Drive

Trip Generation: The trips generated by Carolina Flats at Estes were calculated using the trip generation
rates for Apartments (Code 220) and for Hotel (310) from the ITE Trip Generation Manual 8th Edition
(ITE, Washington, D.C., 2008). The proposed development would generate 2,068 vehicle trips per day.
Of these trips, 123 vehicle trips would occur in the AM peak hour, 146 vehicle trips during the Mid-day
peak hour, and 182 trips during the PM peak hour.

Table 4 shows the trip rates and Table 5 shows the number of trips generated by the proposed Carolina
Flats at Estes.

4.1   Adjustments to Trip Generation Rates

Pass-by Trips: There is no adjustment for pass-by trips for the proposed site.

Internal Capture: There is no adjustment for internal capture for the proposed site.

Modal Split: The apartment component of this development is proposed to comprise of student housing
and majority of the students are expected to utilize the transit services for their commute to and from
the university. Trip reduction factors for Daily, AM and PM Peak Hour trips were determined for the
apartment units based on similar student apartment developments in the nearby area. Trip reduction
factors for Daily, AM, Mid-Day and PM Peak Hours were determined as 10%, 50%, 50%, and 20%
respectively. Additional description of the procedure and calculations of the traffic reductions factors
are included in Appendix B. No trip reduction factors were applied to the traffic generated by the hotel.

Trip Generation Budget: As the proposed development will be completed in a single phase, no trip
generation budget is used.

Trip Distribution: The new site traffic volumes were distributed to area roads based on current travel
patterns developed from the traffic counts in the study area. Figures 5 and 6 show the site traffic
distribution for the student apartments and hotel respectively.

Trip Assignment: The new site traffic volumes were assigned to area roads using the trip distributions.
Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the site traffic assignment for the apartments and hotels respectively. Figure 9
illustrates the total site traffic assignment (apartment + hotel) from the proposed Carolina Flats at Estes
development.

5.0   FUTURE TRAFFIC FORECASTS WITH THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT


To obtain future traffic volumes with the proposed Carolina Flats at Estes development, new traffic
demand generated by the development is added to the No Build Conditions. Figure 10 illustrates the
total traffic volumes with the proposed development for the 2015 Build Conditions.

6.0     PROJECT IMPACTS


Traffic flow through an intersection is affected by the volume of traffic, by the intersection geometry
and by the traffic control device. These intersection-specific characteristics are used to define two
measures of congestion: the average vehicle delay time and the Level of Service. Six Levels of Service --
from A to F -- are related to vehicle delay, with Level of Service A representing no congestion, Level of
Service E representing long delays, and Level of Service F representing excessive delays with vehicles
having to wait several signal cycles to clear an intersection. Table 6 summarizes the Level of Service
criteria.

At intersections with signals, the Volume-to-Capacity ratio is one of the parameters used in calculating
Level of Service, and while Level of Service is related to capacity, the relationship is not a simple one.
Signal cycle lengths, the quality of vehicle progression through adjacent intersections with signals and
green signal time can affect the Levels of Service without varying the Volume-to-Capacity ratio. It is
possible therefore, to have an intersection operating with a Volume-to-Capacity ratio of 1.0 (at
capacity), while maintaining relatively low average delay times because of efficient intersection
operating conditions (i.e. orderly progression, short cycle length, etc.). Similarly, poor operating
conditions could result in Level of Service F (i.e. long delays to traffic) with Volume-to-Capacity ratios
considerably below 1.0. Therefore, the designation of Level of Service F does not automatically imply
that the intersection, approach, or lane group is overloaded, nor does a Level of Service in the A to E
range automatically imply that the intersection is operating efficiently.

At intersections without signals, Level of Service is evaluated for left-turning traffic volumes on the main
road and for all traffic volumes on the minor road. It should be noted that the unsignalized intersection
capacity analysis is extremely conservative. That is, if traffic demand on an approach is predicted to
flow at Level of Service F (over capacity), then the intersection should be monitored to determine if a
traffic signal or other intersection improvements are needed. In some cases, gaps in the traffic flow
created by upstream and downstream signals will enable traffic demand at nearby unsignalized
intersections to flow with little or no delay. This may not be reflected in the technical analysis.

  The following factors have been used in the intersection capacity analyses:
              Ideal saturation flow rate is 1,900 passenger cars per hour per lane (PCPH).
              Peak hour factor of 0.90.

  6.1   Arterial Capacity Analysis

  The 2015 No Build and Build Conditions arterial capacity analysis indicates that the traffic demand along
  Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive would continue to exceed the roadway capacity limits
  (Volume-to-Capacity ratios greater than 1.0) during at least one peak hour of the day, indicating a need
  for additional roadway improvements.

  This indicates that the traffic generated by the proposed Carolina Flats at Estes development would add
  minimal impact on the surrounding area roads. Tables 7 and 8 show the results of the peak hour arterial
  capacity analysis for the 2015 No Build and Build Conditions respectively.

6.2   Access Analysis

The proposed Carolina Flats at Estes would have two driveways as described below:

        Driveway #1 with full access/egress on Estes Drive east of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard
        Driveway #2 with right in/right out access/egress on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard north of
        Estes Drive

No additional access would be required for the proposed development.


6.3   Signal Warrant Analysis

Signal warrant analyses were performed for the following unsignalized intersections for the 2015 No
Build and Build Conditions:
        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at Shadowood Drive
        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at Driveway #2 (Build Only)
        Estes Drive at Driveway #1 (Build Only)
        Estes Drive at Somerset Road

Of the nine signal warrants described in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) 2009
edition, the required data was available to analyze the following three warrants: Warrant 2 - Four-Hour
Vehicular Volume; Warrant 3 - Peak Hour Vehicular Volume; and Warrant 7 - Crash Experience. The
following is a brief description of each of these warrants.

Warrant 2 – Four-Hour Vehicular Volume: According to the MUTCD, the need for a traffic signal under
the Four-Hour Vehicular Volume Warrant shall be considered if, during any four hours of an average
day, the plotted points representing the vehicles per hour on the major street (total of both approaches)
and corresponding vehicles per hour on the higher-volume minor-street approach (one-direction only)
fall above the applicable curve representing the warrant threshold.

Warrant 3 - Peak Hour: According to the MUTCD, the need for a traffic signal under the Peak Hour
Warrant shall be considered if, for any one peak hour of an average day, the plotted points representing
the vehicles per hour on the major street (total of both approaches) and the corresponding vehicles per
hour on the higher-volume minor-street approach (one-direction only) fall above the applicable curve
representing the warrant threshold.

Warrant 7 – Crash Experience: According to the MUTCD, the need for a traffic signal under the Crash
Experience Warrant shall be considered if five or more reported crashes, of types susceptible to
correction by a traffic signal, have occurred within a 12-month period. Each crash must have involved
personal injury or property damage apparently exceeding the applicable requirements for a reported
crash.

In summary, traffic demand at none of the four unsignalized study intersections would not warrant
traffic signals under the 2015 No Build or the 2015 Build Conditions. As the traffic demand in the area
increases and/or new development projects occur in the area, these intersections should be monitored
to determine a need for traffic signals in the future.

6.4   Signal Phasing Analysis

The signalized intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard/Estes Drive has multi-phase signal
controllers that can accommodate variations in traffic flow.

6.5   Crash Analysis

Crash data were obtained from the NCDOT for the 36-month period (3 years) from April 1, 2009 to
March 31, 2012 for the locations most likely to be impacted by the proposed development. The
following roadway segments were included in the crash analysis:

        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard from Ashley Forest Road to Airport Drive
        Estes Drive from Halifax Road to Airport Drive

The following intersections were included in the crash analysis:

        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Piney Mountain Road/Municipal Drive
        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Shadowood Drive
        Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive
        Estes Drive and Somerset Drive
        Estes Drive and Caswell Road/Clayton Road

On Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard between Ashley Forest Road and Airport Drive, 84 crashes were
reported during the three-year study period resulting in a crash rate of 342 crashes per 100 million
vehicle miles travelled (MVMT). Of these, 53 were rear-end crashes, 15 were turning, and five were
angle roadway crashes. The possible causes of these crashes might be attributed to congestion along
the corridor and signalized intersections. Also, the angle/left/right-turning crashes are likely the result of
impatient drivers who misjudge the speed of oncoming traffic.

During the three-year period, 63 crashes were reported on Estes Drive between Airport Drive and
Halifax Road resulting in a crash rate of 340 crashes per 100 MVMT. Of these, 34 were rear-end crashes
and 16 were angle/left-turning crashes. As with the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard segment, possible
causes of these crashes might be attributed to congestion along the corridor and signalized
intersections. The angle/left/right-turning crashes are likely the result of impatient drivers who
misjudge the speed of oncoming traffic.

During the three-year period, 15 crashes were reported at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard at Piney Mountain Drive. Of these, 10 were rear-end crashes, with the rest being dispersed
between angle, left-turn and sideswipe type crashes. The possible causes of the high number of rear-
end crashes might be attributed to congestion along the corridor and signalized intersection.

At the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at Shadowood Drive, 3 crashes were reported.
Of these, two were rear-end crashes and one was a left-turning crash.

During the three-year period, 34 crashes were reported at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard at Estes Drive. Of these, 17 were rear-end crashes, with the rest being dispersed between
angle, left-turn (same and different roadways), right-turn and sideswipe type crashes. The possible

                                                                                  Carolina Flats at Estes
                                                                               Chapel Hill, North Carolina

causes of the high number of rear-end crashes might be attributed to congestion along the corridor and
signalized intersection.

During the three-year period, four crashes were reported at the intersection of Estes Drive at Somerset
Drive. All of these were rear-end crashes.

During the three-year period, eight crashes were reported at the intersection of Estes Drive and Caswell
Road/Clayton Road. Of these, five were rear-end crashes, two were angle, and one was ran off road
crash.

The state-wide average crash rate for a roadway similar to Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard is 258
crashes per 100 MVMT and 228 crashes per 100 MVMT along Estes Drive. This indicates that Martin
Luther King, Jr. Boulevard has about 30% more crashes than the state-wide average. Similarly, Estes
Drive has about 50% more crashes than the state-wide average. The high crash rate could be attributed
to congestion present along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive. It should also be noted
that crash rate calculations for smaller sections, generally, result in skewed results as is in this case.

The new traffic demand generated by the proposed project would have little impact on safety
conditions in the study area. Table 9 presents the number of crashes by type in the study area.

6.6   Progression Analysis

Since the two signalized study intersections (Piney Mountain and Estes Drive along Martin Luther King,
Jr. Drive) are part of the signal system and the proposed development does not add significant number
of vehicles to these intersections during the peak hour, no progression analysis was conducted as part of
this study.

6.7   Peak Hour Intersection Capacity Analysis

A comparison of the 2015 traffic flow conditions without the proposed project (the No Build Conditions)
to the 2015 traffic flow conditions with the proposed project in place (the Build Conditions) determines
the impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding roadway network.


2015 No Build Conditions:

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Piney Mountain Road/Municipal Road: The signalized
intersection capacity analysis at Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Piney Mountain Road/Municipal
Road indicates that this intersection on the whole would function at Level of Service C or better, a good
rate of flow, during the peak hours. The northbound and southbound approaches would function at
Level of Service D or better, an acceptable rate of flow. The eastbound approach of Municipal Road and
westbound approach of Piney Mountain Road would continue to exceed roadway capacity limits (LOS F)
during the peak hours.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Shadowood Drive: At the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard and Shadowood Drive, the unsignalized intersection capacity analysis indicates that the
westbound stop controlled right-turn movement would operate at a Level of Service B or better, a very
good rate of flow during the peak hours.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive: The signalized intersection capacity analysis at
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive indicates that this intersection on the whole would
approach its roadway capacity limits (Level of Service E) during the peak hours. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard northbound and southbound approaches would function at Level of Service D or better, an
acceptable rate of flow, during the peak hours with one exception. The exception is the southbound left-
turn movement which would flow at Level of Service F( exceeding its roadway capacity limits) during PM
peak Hour. The eastbound and westbound approaches of Estes Drive would also approach or exceed its
roadway capacity limits (Level of Service E or F) during the peak hours.

Estes Drive and Somerset Road: At the intersection of Estes Drive and Somerset Road, the unsignalized
intersection capacity analysis indicates the southbound stop controlled movements would approach
roadway capacity limits (LOS E) during at least one peak hour.

Estes Drive and Caswell Road/Clayton Road: The signalized intersection capacity analysis at Estes Drive
and Caswell Road/Clayton Road indicates that all approaches at this intersection would function at a
Level of Service C or better, a good rate of flow during the peak hours.

The intersection capacity analyses for the 2015 No Build Conditions are summarized in Table 10.

2015 Build Conditions:

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Piney Mountain Road/Municipal Road: The signalized
intersection capacity analysis at Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Piney Mountain Road/Municipal
Road indicates that this intersection on the whole would continue to operate at a Level of Service C or
better, a good rate of flow, during the peak hours. The northbound and southbound approaches would
function at Level of Service D or better, an acceptable rate of flow with one exception. The exception is
northbound left-turn movement, which would flow at Level of Service E (approaching its roadway
capacity limits) during AM Peak Hour. This change in Level of Service would result in increase of an
average delay of approximately seven seconds per vehicle to 153 vehicles in the AM Peak Hour. The
eastbound approach of Municipal Road and westbound approach of Piney Mountain Road would
continue to exceed its roadway capacity limits (LOS F) during the peak hours.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Shadowood Drive: At the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard and Shadowood Drive, the unsignalized intersection capacity analysis indicates that the
westbound stop controlled right-turn movement would operate at Level of Service B or better, a very
good rate of flow during the peak hours.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Driveway #2: At the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard and Shadowood Drive, the unsignalized intersection capacity analysis indicates that the
westbound stop controlled right-turn movement would operate at Level of Service B or better, a very
good rate of flow during the peak hours.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive: The signalized intersection capacity analysis at
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and Estes Drive indicates that this intersection on the whole would
approach roadway capacity limits (Level of Service E) during the peak hours. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Boulevard northbound and southbound approaches would function at a Level of Service D or better, an
acceptable rate of flow, during the peak hours with one exception. The exception is southbound left-
turn movement, which would flow at Level of Service F (exceeding its roadway capacity limits) during
PM Peak Hour. The eastbound and westbound approaches of Estes Drive would approach or exceed its
roadway capacity limits (LOS E or F) during the peak hours.

Estes Drive and Driveway #1: At the intersection of Estes Drive and Driveway #1, the unsignalized
intersection capacity analysis indicates southbound stop controlled movements would operate at Level
of Service D or better, an acceptable rate of flow during the peak hours.

Estes Drive and Somerset Road: At the intersection of Estes Drive and Somerset Road, the unsignalized
intersection capacity analysis indicates that the southbound stop controlled movements would
approach its roadway capacity limits (Level of Service E) during at least one peak hour.

Estes Drive and Caswell Road/Clayton Road: The signalized intersection capacity analysis at Estes Drive
and Caswell Road/Clayton Road indicates that all approaches of this intersection would operate at Level
of Service C or better, a good rate of flow during the peak hours.

In summary, the 2015 Build Conditions traffic flow would be similar to the 2015 No Build Conditions
indicating that the traffic generated by the proposed Carolina Flats at Estes development would have

DRAFT TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM #4: EXISTING
CONDITIONS ANALYSIS

This memorandum discusses the current performance of Prineville's transportation system and
highlights existing needs that can be addressed through future projects, policies and programs
implemented by the City. This memo serves as a companion to Technical Memorandum #3:
Existing Transportation Inventory and the current policies, and goals and objectives identified in
Technical Memorandums #1 and #2.

MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION

The performance of the street system is often quantified using three measures: Level of Service
(LOS), volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio, and 95th percentile queue lengths. These measures were
calculated for 22 intersections on the city's collector and arterial roadways to provide an
indication of the system performance as a whole. As discussed below, all 22 intersections
analyzed meet City and ODOT performance measures, with the exception of the OR 126/Tom
McCall Road intersection. Three other intersections meet applicable standards, but operate with
higher levels of delay than other intersections in the city. Figure 4-1 illustrates the intersection
performance results (Applicable traffic count data, analysis methodologies, and operational
standards/targets are summarized in Appendix A and Appendix B.)

Intersection Delay and Capacity Analysis

Figure 4-1 illustrates the study intersection locations and existing traffic conditions relative to
ODOT and City of Prineville mobility and level-of-service standards (see Appendix B). The
intersections were rated red, yellow, and green, based on whether the applicable performance
standards are met. The figure also identifies those intersections that operate at Level of Service
"C" or better, which generally indicates minor delays and a user's perception of minor levels of
congestion during most times of the day. A description of level of service and the criteria by which they
are determined is presented in Appendix B 1.




1Appendix "B" indicates how level of service is measured and what is generally considered the acceptable 1
range of level of service. Intersection level of service (LOS) is analogous to the letter grades in a school
report card. Motorists using an intersection that operates at LOS "A" experience very little delay, while
those using an intersection that operates at LOS "F" will experience intolerably long delays.

Figure 4-1 shows that all study intersections, except the OR 126/Tom McCall Road intersection,
meet the applicable mobility standards. The OR 126/Tom McCall Road intersection operates at
LOS "F" and a volume-to-capacity ratio of 1.0 during the 30th highest hour, the critical time period
during which the intersection performance is compared to City and ODOT standards. Traffic
operations worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

To better understand the number of hours the OR 126/Tom McCall intersection doesn't meet
standards, 16-hour traffic volume counts were obtained and analyzed. As shown in Exhibit 4-1,
the intersection exceeds ODOT mobility target (v/c ratio > 0.90) in the mid-afternoon (i.e., between
2:45 and 4:30 p.m.) and City and County standards (delay > 50 seconds) during both the mid-
afternoon and afternoon commute hours (i.e., between 2:45 to 4:30 p.m. and again between 4:45
and 6:30 p.m).

Intersection Queuing Analysis

Understanding how long, both in terms of length and time, queues of cars line up at intersections
provide an indication of a user's sense of congestion at a particular location. Intersection queuing
analysis can also identify locations where the storage provided to accommodate those queues

may need to be lengthened. To provide this understanding, queuing analysis was performed at
the study intersections in accordance with the ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual (APM,1). The
95th Percentile queue lengths were calculated using Synchro 7 software, which implements the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology (2).

Per this analysis, the N 3rd Street/Main Street intersection is the only intersection identified to
have 95th percentile queues that exceed available storage capacity on one or more approaches. The
remaining study intersections have adequate storage, though long queues were noted at several
signalized intersections along N 3rd Street. Appendix C contains a summary of queuing analysis
results for all study intersections.

ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

Neither the City nor the state has adopted standards that can be used to assess the performance of
the "active transportation system". In lieu of standards, key gaps in the existing bicycle and
pedestrian system were identified through a review of the Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Action
Plans prepared by the City and its residents for three schools in Prineville and an assessment of
the location of existing sidewalks and bicycle routes relative to popular/desired pedestrian and
bicycle destinations (e.g., downtown, hospital, city parks, etc.).

SRTS Action Plans

The recommendations and strategies from SRTS Action Plans for Cecil Sly Elementary School,
Crook County Middle School, and Crooked River Elementary School included a Safe Routes
Segment Map, shown in Appendix D. The map shows seven preferred pedestrian and bicycle
route "segments" that connect residential areas north of N 3rd Street to the schools on the south
side of N 3rd Street.

As part of implementation of the Action Plans, the City has funded construction of sidewalks and
curbs on the west and north side of the following segments:

    ·    Segments #4 and #6 (NE Juniper Street) from E 1st Street to Laughlin Road

    ·    Segment #3 (Laughlin Road) from Juniper Street to Hudspeth Road

    ·    Segment #2 (Hudspeth Road) from Laughlin Road to Existing Sidewalk near Jordan Lane

Pedestrian Network

The existing pedestrian network is well developed in the downtown area and within private
subdivisions in the northern part of the city. However, some pedestrian links that connect the
northern developments to the central and southern part of town are missing, as confirmed by the
SRTS Action Plans. Based on an analysis completed to determine the connectivity of existing
pedestrian routes to destinations, the following sidewalk gaps were identified:

         Main Street north of 10th Street to City boundary: The addition of sidewalks along this
         segment of Main Street would provide a pedestrian connection between residential areas
         in the north part of the city and civic destinations, such as the pool, schools, and parks.

         Lynn Boulevard from SE Combs Road to S Main Street: The addition of sidewalks or a
         separated path would provide a safe pedestrian connection for students with the adjacent
         middle school, high school, Central Oregon Community College satellite campus, and
         access to the fairgrounds.

         SE Combs Flat Road: The addition of sidewalks along this segment will help serve students
         and surrounding residents along one of a limited number of north-south connections in
         the City. This infrastructure will also support future redevelopment of the Ochoco
         Lumber site and connect these areas north across N 3rd Street to shopping opportunities
         and ultimately to the Iron Horse property.

         Fairview between Lynn Boulevard and N 3rd Street: Filling in the sidewalk gaps on Fairview
         would provide a central north-south corridor.

         NE 7th Street and Loper Avenue: sidewalks along these streets would provide beneficial east-
         west connections across Prineville's northeast quadrant. To accommodate right-of-way,
         slope, utilities, and driveway issues, either of these roadways could be improved with a
         sidewalk along one side of the roadway.

         Ochoco Creek Trail System: the City plans to pave the trail between Harwood east to Main
         Street. Extension of this trail system across N 3rd Street and into a Combs Flat pedestrian
         system would link the northwest and southeast portions of the City, and has been
         considered previously by the City as part of a possible Rails-to-Trails project along the
         abandoned rail right-of-way.

Bicycle Network

The existing bicycle network in Prineville provides regional and some local connections. There is
an existing bike route along N 3rd Street and Main Street which provide east-west and north-south
regional connections, respectively. Based on an analysis completed to determine the connectivity
of existing bicycle routes to key destinations, the following is a list of identified gaps of bike
facilities with the associated justification:

         Main Street between Davidson Park and NW 10th Street: provision of bike lanes would
         complete a missing gap in the network and provide regional and local north-south
         connectivity.

         Parallel east-west routes to N 3rd Street: routing bicycles and providing bike lanes on 2nd
         Street or 4th Street could be considered. A off-street bike path that follows the N 3rd Street
         alignment could also key downtown bicycle connectivity needs.

         SE Combs Flat Road: a continuous bicycle facility from SE Lynn Boulevard north of N 3rd
         Street would provide connections into the planned Iron Horse development. This could be

         integrated with pedestrian needs as part of a mixed use trail system or a combination of
         sidewalks, trails, and bicycle lanes.

As part of developing an implementation plan for the TSP, pedestrian and bicycle transportation
improvements will be prioritized. Prioritization will be based on project goals and objectives and
take into account volume and roadway characteristics.

CRASH HISTORY

Over the five-year study period (January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2011), 415 crashes were
reported within the Prineville UGB. Figure 4-2 illustrates crash locations by severity at study
intersections. Roadway segment and intersection crash history is summarized in Appendix E.

Findings from the crash analysis indicate the following:

         Approximately 45 percent of reported crashes (188 crashes) occurred on state highways,
         and 94 percent of those occurred on Ochoco Highway (OR 126 west of the Prineville "Y"
         and US 26/OR 126 ­ N 3rd Street east of the Prineville "Y").
         No fatal traffic crashes were reported during the five year period.
         Nine pedestrian-involved crashes and eight bicyclist-involved crashes were reported over
         the 5-year period and all resulted in injuries. The locations of the crashes vary throughout
         the UGB.
         The Deer Street/2nd Street intersection has a crash rate of 1.17 crashes per million entering
         vehicles. This rate exceeds the statewide 90th percentile rate of 0.41 for similar
         intersections, as documented in Assessment of Statewide Intersection Safety Performance,
         prepared for ODOT and FHWA. Of the 10 crashes reported at this intersection, eight
         resulted in injury.
         The N 4th Street/Main Street intersection has a crash rate of 0.71 crashes per million
         entering vehicles. This rate also exceeds the statewide 90th percentile rate of 0.41 for similar
         intersections.
Based on information provided by ODOT, the following segments were identified in the top 5 or
10 percent of SPIS sites.

         A segment of US 26 (N 3rd Street) from Maple to Claypool (Milepost 18.43 to 18.61) was
         identified in the 2012 top 5-percent of all ODOT sites based on 2009 to 2011 crash data.
         A segment from Deer Street to Claypool (Milepost 18.53 to 18.64) was in the 2009 top 10-
         percent of all ODOT SPIS sites.
         A segment of US 26 at Harwood and a segment of US 26 at Combs Flat Road (Milepost
         19.67 to 19.76) were identified in the top 10-percent of 2011 SPIS sites, based on 2008 to
         2010 crash reports.

As part of developing the implementation plan for the TSP, the roadway segments identified with
crash rates higher than the statewide average and those in the top 5 or 10 percent of the ODOT
Safety Priority Index System2 will be reviewed in greater detail to identify opportunities to reduce
crash frequency.

The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) identifies several methods to identify crash sites with
potential for crash reduction. Following review of these methods, the critical crash rate method was
applied to Prineville intersections based on available data. This methodology takes into account
traffic volumes and crash frequencies. The data and analysis are summarized in Appendix E.

ACCESS MANAGEMENT

Driveway access onto roadways creates turbulence that reduces throughput and introduces
conflict points (for motorized and non-motorized travelers). Expressway facilities, such as OR 126
near the airport, are designated for high-speed intercity travel. Within the downtown core ODOT
has designated N 3rd Street (US 26) as a Special Transportation Area, with an emphasis on
balancing the needs of local businesses and through travel.

The purpose of access standards and management is to preserve the roadway for its intended
function. Poor access management results in frequent conflicts and makes travel for bicyclists and
pedestrians difficult. The stopping or decelerating maneuvers of turning vehicles impacts
following vehicles, and creates conflicts. Additionally, numerous access points impact businesses,
taking up commercially zoned land for circulation rather than building space, parking, or
landscaping.

Existing access management standards defined in the revised Oregon Administrative Rule 734
and by the City were applied to existing corridors and segments adjacent to study intersections.
These current standards are summarized in Appendix F.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Analysis of the motorized and active transportation systems indicated the following:

         All 22 intersections analyzed meet City and ODOT performance measures, with the
         exception of the OR 126/Tom McCall Road intersection. Three other intersections meet



2The Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) is a method developed by ODOT for ranking locations annually
on state highways by considering crash frequency, crash rate, and crash severity. ODOT's annual SPIS
analysis uses the most-recent three years of crash data (i.e., 2012 SPIS sites are based on 2009 through 2011
crash data).

A roadway segment is designated as a SPIS site if a location experiences three or more crashes or one or
more fatal crashes over a three-year period. Under this method, all state highways are analyzed in 0.10 mile
segments to identify SPIS sites. Statewide, there are approximately 6,000 SPIS sites.

March 29, 2013                                                                                       Page 4-9


         applicable standards, but operate with higher levels of delay than other intersections in
         the city.
         The N 3rd Street/Main Street intersection is the only intersection identified to have 95th
         percentile queues that exceed available storage capacity on one or more approaches. The
         remaining study intersections have adequate storage, though long queues were noted at
         several signalized intersections along N 3rd Street.
         Key gaps in the existing bicycle and pedestrian system were identified through a review
         of the Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Action Plans prepared by the City and its residents for
         three schools in Prineville and an assessment of the location of existing sidewalks and
         bicycle routes relative to popular/desired pedestrian and bicycle destinations (e.g.,
         downtown, hospital, city parks, etc.).

         Nine pedestrian-involved crashes and eight bicyclist-involved crashes were reported over
         the 5-year period and all resulted in injuries. The locations of the crashes vary throughout
         the UGB.
         The Deer Street/2nd Street intersection has a crash rate of 1.17 crashes per million entering
         vehicles. This rate exceeds the statewide 90th percentile rate of 0.41 for similar
         intersections, as documented in Assessment of Statewide Intersection Safety Performance,
         prepared for ODOT and FHWA. Of the 10 crashes reported at this intersection, eight
         resulted in injury.
         The N 4th Street/Main Street intersection has a crash rate of 0.71 crashes per million
         entering vehicles. This rate also exceeds the statewide 90th percentile rate of 0.41 for similar

APPENDIX A ­ TRAFFIC COUNT DATA
Existing Conditions Analysis                                      Prineville Transportation System Plan
March 29, 2013                                                                                  Page B2


The weekday evening period (from 3 to 6 p.m.) was identified as the peak period for analysis. The
peak period traffic volume data collection and development of design hour volumes is described
below.

Turning movement volumes were obtained at study intersections (outlined in Appendix B, Table
B-2) during the weekday evening peak period in April 2012. The evening peak period counts
were conducted from 4 to 6 p.m., except at those intersections near schools that were counted
from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Historic weekday p.m. peak hour counts were obtained from October 2010
at intersections on OR 126.

Individual intersection peak hours were identified for use in the traffic analysis to maintain a
conservative analysis of the peak period, and to reflect peaking characteristics associated with
schools near some study intersections. The volumes were balanced on major corridors (e.g., N 3rd
Street and Main Street) where individual intersection peak hours are consistent. The balanced
volumes allow for some variation between intersections to account for driveway volumes
between intersections.

A seasonal adjustment factor was calculated based on the On-site Automatic Traffic Recorder
(ATR) method to develop 30th Hour Volumes (30 HV). Since there are no ATR stations within the
Prineville UGB, seasonal adjustment factors were developed based on data collected at the two
closest ATR stations ­ ATR Station 07-001 (on US 26, approximately 4.2 miles east of Main Street)
and Station 07-002 (on OR 126, approximately 15.3 miles west of Main Street). The seasonal
factors developed from data at ATR station 07-001 are not applicable to the TSP because traffic
east of Prineville does not reflect commuter traffic between Prineville and Bend/Redmond, which
accounts for a large portion of traffic in Prineville. The seasonal adjustment factors calculated
based on data collected at ATR station 07-002 for April and October were found to be 1.07 and
1.09, respectively. The ATR data and seasonal adjustment factor calculations are attached.

ODOT Intersection Traffic Operations Performance Standards

ODOT uses volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio standards to assess intersections operations. Table
6 of the Oregon Highway Plan (OHP - Reference 4) provides the peak hour volume-to-capacity
ratio targets for all signalized and unsignalized intersections outside the Metro area. The OHP
ratios are used to evaluate existing conditions.

Study Intersection Performance Standards

Table B-2 shows the applicable governing jurisdiction, intersection control, and performance
standard for each study intersection.

Signalized Intersection Level-of-Service

Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused
by other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment.
Six grades are used to denote the various level of service from "A" to "F". The six level-of-service
grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table B-3. Additionally, Table B-
3 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per vehicle.
Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay,
and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service "D" is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

     Table B-3 Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

   Level of
   Service                                                          Average Delay per Vehicle

                   Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is
                   extremely favorable, and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at
         A         all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.

                   Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per
                   vehicle. This generally occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop
         B         than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of average delay.

                   Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per
                   vehicle. These higher delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual
                   cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this
         C         level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.

                   Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per
                   vehicle. The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some
                   combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many
                   vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are
         D         noticeable.

                   Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per
                   vehicle. This is usually considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
                   generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity
         E         ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.

                   Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to
                   most drivers. This condition often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high
                   volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle
         F         lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

Analysis Methodology and Performance Standards

All operations analysis described in this report were performed in accordance with the
procedures in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Reference 1). Per the ODOT Analysis Procedures
Manual (APM ­ Reference 2), intersection operational evaluations were conducted based on the
peak 15-minute flow rate observed during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Using the peak 15-

minute flow rate ensures this analysis is based on a reasonable worst-case scenario. For this
reason, the analysis reflects conditions that are likely to occur for 15 minutes out of each average
weekday p.m. peak hour. The transportation system will likely operate under conditions better
than those described in this report during other typical time periods.

The operational analysis results were compared with mobility standards used by the local
agencies to assess performance and potential areas for improvement.

City of Prineville Intersection Operations Performance Standards

The City of Prineville has established volume-to-capacity, delay, and queuing standards that vary
by traffic control (Reference 3). The standards, summarized in Table B-1, apply to intersections
that only include City or County roadways.

Unsignalized Intersection Level-of-Service

Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled
(AWSC) intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for
estimating control delay at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the
various service levels associated with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B-5. A
quantitative definition of level of service for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B-6.
Using this definition, Level of Service "E" is generally considered to represent the minimum
acceptable design standard.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference
is that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation
facilities. The expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic
volumes than an unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior
considerations that combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at
unsignalized intersections. For example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax
during the red interval, while drivers on the minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must
remain attentive to the task of identifying acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is
often much more variability in the amount of delay experienced by individual drivers at
unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these reasons, it is considered that
the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an unsignalized intersection
than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is calculated for
AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the major
street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures
of effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average
queue lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst
movement only, such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic
control decisions. The potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be
particularly pronounced when the HCM level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal
standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

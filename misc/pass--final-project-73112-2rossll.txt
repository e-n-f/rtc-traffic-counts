Introduction

The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) has initiated a program for the coordination
of signals throughout the San Francisco Bay Area called the Program for Arterial System
Synchronization (PASS). Marin County applied for and received a grant to coordinate traffic signals
along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. The first deliverable for the project was the detailed scope of
work, schedule and budget dated September 30, 2011.

The goal of this project is to facilitate traffic progression along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, and to
update the signal timing plans to achieve operational efficiency of the traffic signals with the existing
capacity constraints. Attaining this goal is expected to reduce traffic congestion, reduce traffic
delays, reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases, reduce automobile travel time along the
study corridors, and improve traffic safety. The project objective is to develop traffic signal
coordination timing plans for the a.m., midday and p.m. peak periods that typically occur between
the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., and 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.,
respectively. Prior to developing traffic signal coordination timing plans for these periods, it is
necessary to establish current traffic conditions and system performance under existing signal
timing. Accordingly, this report includes a description of existing conditions as measured in the
field and also as estimated in Synchro models based on current signal timing.

The twelve traffic signals to be retimed in Marin County and the City of Larkspur as a part of
this project are shown in Figure 1. The twelve traffic signals were coordinated as a system in
2006. According to City of Larkspur and Marin County staff, the City and County traffic
controllers consist of model 170 and 170E. The City-owned signals uses BiTrans traffic
controller software and will require signal timing plans to be implemented in the field. The
Caltrans traffic controllers are also model 170E, but operate with Caltrans C8 software and will
also need to be implemented in the field. The County of Marin traffic signals are interconnected
to each other via twisted pair and maintain coordination to the City of Larkspur and Caltrans via
signal timing. In addition, the City of Larkspur intersections are connected with the Caltrans
intersections via twisted pair.

Study Intersections
The following is a list of the traffic signal systems that were selected for the project.

Existing Conditions Analysis

This report has compiled data provided by the Marin County, City of Larkspur and collected by
the consultant. The following data was provided by Marin County for this project:
    •    Synchro files.
    •    Intersection collision history.
    •    Signal timing sheets.
    •    Recent traffic counts.
    •    Traffic signal as-built plans.

The City of Larkspur and Caltrans provided signal timing sheets for their respective traffic signals
on the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard corridor.

Consultant-collected data include:
    •    Machine classification and average daily traffic counts for seven days by direction in
         15-minute intervals (See Appendix A).
    •    Manual turning movement counts for each study intersection for the a.m., midday and p.m.
         peak periods along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. These counts include vehicles,
         pedestrians and bicyclists (See Appendix A).
    •    Field review verifying lane configurations, speed limits, turn lane storage lengths, and traffic
         signal phasing (See Appendix A for applicable notes).
    •    Four floating car runs in each direction for each of the three peak periods for Sir Francis
         Drake Boulevard (See Appendix B).
    •    Field review that identifies intersections that are oversaturated, significant differences in
         the proportions of trucks and buses from default values in Synchro, major driveways and
         unsignalized intersections that may affect arrival rates and patterns at signalized
         intersections, parking maneuvers, pedestrian activity, and other traffic patterns that may
         affect the ability to coordinate signals in the system.
    •    Field identification of study intersections with uneven vehicle distribution in travel lanes.
    •    Field identification of locations where left-turn or right-turn queue exceeds the storage
         length of the turning lane.

There was no missing data from Caltrans, City of Larkspur and County of Marin.

Accident data was obtained from the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) and
the signalized intersections were reviewed with respect to accident patterns that may be
correctible by changing basic signal settings and improving coordination. Additionally, existing
signal settings were reviewed to identify potential changes that might reduce delay to vehicles,
pedestrians and bicyclists. Such settings include clearance intervals for vehicles, pedestrians and
bicyclists; gap and extension settings for dilemma zone protection; cycle lengths as influenced by
minimum and maximum green times; and phase sequence.

This section of the report presents findings and conclusions with respect to existing conditions and
the potential for signal system improvements. It also serves as a baseline for comparing future
signal timing recommendations with existing signal system performance.

Roadway Network
Sir Francis Drake Boulevard (SFDB) is a major east-west arterial through Marin County and the City
of Larkspur that provides access to and from the I-580 freeway and US 101. Currently, SFDB
carries approximately 39,302 vehicles per day (vpd) during the weekdays and 30,494 vpd during
the weekend. SFDB provides access to the Cities of Larkspur, Ross, San Anselmo, and the
unincorporated communities of Greenbrae and Kentfield. Within the project area, SFDB provides
direct access to four schools (College of Marin, A.E. Kent Middle School, Marin Catholic High
School, and Anthony Bacich Elementary School), two parks (Bon Air Landing and Niven), the Bon
Air Shopping Center, the Marin General Hospital, and the Marin Healthcare District.

Traffic Volumes and Patterns
Figure 2 shows the a.m. peak hour, midday peak hour, and p.m. peak hour vehicle turning
movement counts for the twelve study intersections. Figure 2 also shows the weekday average
daily traffic (ADT) along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. Table I summarizes the a.m. peak period,
midday peak period, and p.m. peak period pedestrian and bicycle counts for the study
intersections.

TJKM conducted the turning movement counts during typical weekdays (Tuesday through
Thursday) in October 2011 when schools were in session. Appendix A contains the vehicle,
pedestrian, and bicycle counts for the study intersections. These counts were entered into the
Synchro model for the existing conditions analysis.

Results of Field Checks
The signal phasing sequences for all study intersections were observed in the field to verify
information provided by Marin County and the City of Larkspur. Figure 3 shows the existing lane
configurations and signal phasing at the study intersections.

Sir Francis Drake Boulevard Traffic Signal System
     1. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /Elm Avenue
             o The traffic signal actuates for vehicles exiting the parking lot on the north side of
                the intersection and for pedestrians crossing Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to and
                from the College of Marin.
             o There is minimal queuing of traffic in the eastbound left-turn lane.
             o There is typically a platoon of vehicles traveling eastbound due to presence of only
                one travel lane.
             o Westbound traffic merges into one lane just east of the intersection. However,
                queues only form when the traffic signal is actuated for Elm Avenue.
     2. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /College Avenue
             o The westbound left-turn lane typically backs up with traffic and spills over into the
                through lane.
     3. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /Laurel Grove Avenue
             o There is no queuing of traffic observed at this T-intersection.
     4. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /Wolfe Grade
             o The westbound left-turn pocket typically backs up with traffic and spills into the
                through lane.
             o Traffic typically backs up in both the eastbound and westbound directions.
             o Heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic was observed during the school pick up and
                drop off times.
     5. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /Bon Air Road
             o The dual westbound left-turn pocket typically backs up traffic and requires more
                than one signal cycle to clear the queues. However, since the left-turn lanes are
                long, the queues do not spill into the through lane.
             o Traffic queues were observed in both eastbound and westbound directions at this
                intersection.
     6. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /El Portal Drive
             o The westbound left-turn pocket typically backs up with traffic, but does not spill
                over into the through lane.
             o Traffic queues were observed in both eastbound and westbound directions at this
                intersection.
     7. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /La Cuesta Drive
             o The westbound left-turn pocket typically backs up with traffic, but does not spill
                over into the through lane.
             o During the p.m. peak period the westbound queues were observed to extend up
                to Eliseo Drive.

    8. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /Eliseo Drive/Barry Way
            o The dual westbound left-turn pocket typically queues with traffic that spills over
               into the through lane.
            o Traffic queues were observed on all directions, except the eastbound left-turn
               lane.
    9. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /US-101 SB Ramps
            o Traffic queues were observed in the eastbound direction during the a.m. peak
               period extending almost up to La Cuesta Drive.
            o Traffic back up was observed during the a.m. peak period in the southbound left-
               turn direction with vehicles traveling to the ferry terminal.
    10. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard / US-101 NB Ramps
            o The eastbound left-turn pocket typically backs up with traffic and spills over to the
               US-101 southbound ramps.
    11. East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard /Larkspur Landing Circle (W)
            o The dual eastbound left-turn pocket typically queues with traffic, but does not spill
               over into the through lane.
            o The northbound left and right-turn lanes back up only when a ferry arrives from
               San Francisco. The queues typically clear out within three to four signal cycles.
            o During the midday and p.m. peak periods, the southbound right-turn lane backs up
               with traffic and spills over into the through lane. The queues typically clear within
               two to three signal cycles.
    12. East Sir Francis Drake Boulevard / Larkspur Landing Circle (E)
            o Traffic typically backs up in the eastbound direction during both the a.m. and p.m.
               peak periods. The queues spill back to the US-101 northbound ramps during the
               p.m. peak period. However, during the a.m. peak period, the queues are slightly
               shorter.
            o Traffic typically queues in the westbound direction during the p.m. peak period but
               the queues typically clear within one signal cycle.

It was also observed that many drivers unfamiliar with the area did not know the correct lane to
be in to proceed to their destination, thereby driving slower than the posted speed limit.

Development of Existing Conditions Operations Model

Synchro Model Development
Marin County provided Synchro models with existing timings for the twelve study intersections.
All twelve intersections are coded as actuated-coordinated.

An ideal saturation flow rate of 1900 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) was assumed for all
intersections that have an Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) less than 100 percent, and
therefore are not critical, under existing conditions. For critical intersections, field checks of the
saturation flow rate were performed to determine if the saturation flow rate should be modified.
These field checks along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard demonstrated that an ideal saturation flow
rate of 1900 vphpl was also appropriate for the critical intersections. Additionally, the Synchro
models contain heavy vehicle percentages derived from the analysis of seven-day traffic counts, and
peak period conflicting pedestrian and bicycle volumes.

Results of Floating Car Survey
Existing conditions surveys are termed as “Before” survey. The results of the “Before” floating car
surveys will be compared with the “After” floating car surveys that are to be conducted after
implementation of the proposed signal timing plans. The floating car worksheets are contained in
Appendix B.

A floating car run covers a one-way trip of the entire length of a study corridor. These runs
capture the travel time, speed, stopping time, number of stops, and other delays on an individual
directional roadway segment. The floating car survey data was analyzed to obtain overall averages
of travel time, delay, speed, and free flow speed for the entire length of each corridor. Results
from the floating car analysis show that during peak periods, the average speed for a vehicle
traveling along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard ranges from 15-22 mph. The average travel time ranges
from seven (7) to ten and a half (10.5) minutes, and motorists experience between two and a half
(2.5) and six (6) minutes of delay due to the timing of the traffic signals.

System Measures of Effectiveness
Table II summarizes the estimated measures of effectiveness (MOE) from the Synchro models
under existing conditions. Appendix C contains the Synchro model output results for the Arterial
Levels of Service and the MOEs for each signal corridor. The MOEs include such corridor
performance measures as average signal delay, number of stops per vehicle, travel time, average
speeds, and emissions.

With the existing traffic signal timing, as shown in Table II, the arterial level of service in the
eastbound direction for the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard corridor, between Elm Avenue and
Larkspur Landing Circle East, is LOS D during the a.m. and p.m. peak periods. The LOS becomes
F during the midday peak period in the eastbound direction. In the westbound direction, the
arterial level of service is also LOS D during the a.m. peak period and LOS F during the midday,
and p.m. peak periods. Due to control/signal delay under existing conditions, a motorist traveling
along the corridor is expected to travel at an average speed of 5-24 mph in both directions during
the a.m. midday, and p.m. peak periods.

The above MOEs for existing conditions provide a basis for evaluating the proposed signal
coordination plans. This will be done by comparing the results of the proposed optimized timings
with the existing signal timing plans. The proposed signal coordination plans for the Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard corridor is expected to significantly reduce delay, travel time and stops, as well
as increase average speeds.

Accident Analysis
Collisions reported at study intersections along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard were obtained from
the Marin County and Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) database for a
period of three years from September 2007 to December 2010. Collisions that occurred within
200 feet on the approaches to an intersection were considered as occurring at the intersection.
Table III summarizes the number of collisions involving vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists that
were reported at the study intersections during the three-year analysis period.

The collision rates at the intersections along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard were compared with
the statewide mean collision rates for roadways and intersections with similar characteristics.
This comparative analysis was undertaken using the Rate Quality Control Method (RQCM).
This analysis method assists in identifying “susceptible to collision” locations where collision
rates are significantly higher than the average collision rate for a street with comparable traffic
volume and similar characteristics. The statewide collision rate using the RQCM, βeta, was set
at the 95th percentile confidence level, meaning that the observed accident rate would only
occur by chance five times out of one hundred.

Appendix D contains the collision data for the study intersections provided by Marin County, the
City of Marin iSWITRS and SWITRS database. As indicated in Table III, two of the twelve study
intersections are considered to be “susceptible to collision”, as they have accident rates greater
than the corresponding statewide averages over the study period. The two intersections are Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard/Elm Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Eliseo Drive. The collision
data shows that the predominant collision types are side swipe, rear end, and broadside.

Table III shows that the accident rates for the intersections of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard / Elm
Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard / Eliseo Drive of 0.48 and 0.59, respectively, are greater
than the βeta values for the intersections, 0.47 and 0.51, respectively.

At these intersections and the other study intersections along the corridor, improved detector
extension and gap settings, clearance intervals, and improved coordination may help reduce the
number of collisions, particularly right angle and rear end collisions.

Traffic Signal Timing Analysis

Introduction
This section of the report presents the results of TJKM’s signal timing analysis for Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard traffic signal system in the County of Marin and the City of Larkspur.

The primary goal of the timing analysis is to develop traffic signal coordination timing plans for the
weekday a.m. peak, midday peak, and p.m. peak periods to reduce traffic congestion, reduce traffic
delays, reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases, reduce automobile travel time, and
improve traffic safety along the study corridors.

Evaluation Criteria
The following were considered in the evaluation of the existing timing plans and the development
of the proposed timing plans.
    •    The following performance measures were used to evaluate the timings: average travel
         time, average stop delay and average stops.
    •    Lead/lag and split phasing sequence were reviewed to determine instances where it may
         improve the efficiency of the coordination system. Proposed changes to the existing
         lead/lag sequences were discussed with City and County staff.
    •    LOS and saturation flows were reviewed by lane groups and approaches for each
         intersection.
    •    Progression priority was determined based on traffic volumes per approach.
    •    Peak period for time of day coordination plans was based on the average daily traffic
         volume (ADT) analysis.
    •    Progressed bandwidths were selected to maximize the efficiency of the coordinated timing
         plans.
    •    Capacity evaluation was based on queuing analysis and volume to capacity (v/c) ratios for
         each lane group, approach, and cycle lengths.

Signal Timing Analysis
The following steps outline the signal timing analysis.

Step 1: Model development
This task includes the development of a base map using an aerial photo that covers all twelve study
intersections along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.

The task also includes input of turning movement count data for the weekday peak periods into
the Synchro 7 models. Field data such as saturation flow rates, initial lost times, lane utilization
and results from the travel time survey were used to calibrate the model parameters so that the
simulation results accurately replicated observed conditions in the network.

Step 2: Signal grouping
As part of the signal timing process, the natural cycle lengths for each intersection and
coordinatability factors for the signals in the network were reviewed to determine the range of
cycle lengths to use in the optimization process, and also which groups of signals would benefit
most from coordination.



MTC-PASS – Task 4B: Final Project Report with Benefit/Cost Analysis, County of Marin and City            Page 13
of Larkspur                                                                                        July 20, 2012
The natural cycle length is the optimum cycle length for an intersection if it were to operate free.
The coordinatability factor measures the desirability of coordinating two adjacent traffic signals and
it is based on travel time, storage space, the proportion of traffic in platoon, main street traffic
volume, and natural cycle length differences between adjacent intersections. A coordinatability
factor above a threshold of 50 indicates that two adjacent traffic signals are likely to benefit from
coordination.

Step 3: Progression movement determination
This refers to progressing one or both movements on a two-way arterial during coordination.
Progression preferences are dictated by directional traffic distribution. If traffic is balanced in both
directions, a balanced bandwidth is selected to provide equal preference for both directions.

For this study, progression priority was set with the objective of maximizing bandwidth
(“windows” of green for traveling vehicles), and minimizing delay to left-turn movements.

Step 4: Phase sequence evaluation
Leading and lagging left-turn phasing and sequential changes in split phases were reviewed. This was
done with the objective to improve the efficiency of signal operation on the corridor. Leading or
lagging left-turn phasing can be introduced to maximize progression bandwidth.

Left-turn lead/lag phasing sequence was selected and tested for each time period for all intersections
with protected left-turns.

Step 5: Signal timing optimization
Based on the natural cycle lengths of the intersections in the network, a cycle length range was
specified for optimization. The process included splits and offset optimization. Higher cycle lengths
provide better progression for the corridor, but results in the increase in side street delay or
overall intersection delay. Lower cycle lengths reduce side street delay but may not provide
adequate split timing to the coordinated phases along the corridor. This may result in higher
approach v/c ratios, delay, and queuing along the corridor.

Synchro software was utilized for the optimization process. The splits and offset optimizations
were conducted for the weekday a.m., midday, and p.m. peak periods.

Traffic Signal Timing Parameters
Table IV shows a comparison table that summarizes existing and proposed traffic signal timing
parameters. The proposed timing recommendations are based on the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) recommendation for setting yellow and all red timing, the 2010 California Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) recommendation for determining pedestrian walk and
clearance timing, and the September 2009 Caltrans policy directive regarding minimum phase
lengths requirement to accommodate bicyclists. The 2010 MUTCD and Caltrans policy directive
requirements are expected to negatively impact traffic operations at wide intersections with low
side street traffic particularly during off peak periods. The timing parameters are determined as
follows:
Pedestrian Timing
Consistent with the 2010 MUTCD, a five (5) second minimum WALK indication is acceptable for
the City, County and Caltrans traffic signals. Per the 2010 MUTCD requirement, a walking speed of
3.5 feet per second (ft/s) was used to determine pedestrian crossing time (Flash Don’t Walk) for
City, County and Caltrans traffic signals. As part of the analysis, TJKM reviewed the clearance

intervals for all study intersections and made revisions where necessary to accommodate adequate
Flash Don’t Walk (FDW) time for pedestrian crossing. The yellow time and the red clearance time
for all movements were reviewed and revised accordingly to be consistent with the 2010 MUTCD
requirements.
Minimum Phase Lengths
According to Caltrans policy directive, the minimum phase length required for bicycle timing is the
sum of the minimum green timing plus yellow timing plus all red timing, which is determined by the
following equation:

Gmin + Y + Rclear ≥ 6 sec + (W+6ft)/14.7ft/sec

Where,
Gmin = Length of minimum green interval (sec)
Y =Length of yellow interval (sec)
Rclear =Length of red clearance interval (sec)
W =Distance from limit line to far side of last conflicting lane (ft)

      Notes:   1) Walk Time --- Considers pedestrian traffic volume. (2010 MUTCD recommends a 7-second minimum WALK indication, but a
                  Walk Time as short as 4 seconds is acceptable if justified by low pedestrian volumes and characteristics.
               2) Flash Don’t Walk = Pedestrian Clearance Time = Crossing Distance (ft) / Walk Speed (ft/s)

                  Walk Speed = 3.5 ft/s (Per 2010 MUTCD requirement).
               3) Min Green Time --- Considers minimum timing for bicyclists where applicable.
               4) Yellow Time adjusted per ITE Guideline.


               Bold numbers = Proposed Timing Parameter changes.

                    -      Imply no recommended changes to existing timing parameter due to lack of a signal and/or crosswalk for the leg.

Recommended Signal Timing Plans
The following recommended timing plans were developed based on the results obtained from the
signal timing evaluation. Plan 1 is recommended for the weekday a.m. peak period, Plan 2 for the
weekday midday peak period and Plan 3 for the weekday p.m. peak period. Figures 4 through
6 illustrate the recommended timing plans schematically.

Plan 1
Coordinate the ten traffic signals along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard (i.e. from Laurel Grove
Avenue to Larkspur Landing Circle East) as a traffic signal group with 110 seconds cycle length.
Operate the traffic signals located at Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Elm Avenue, Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard/College Avenue, Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Eliseo Drive, Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard/US 101 NB Ramp and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/US 101 SB Ramp as Free.

Plan 2
Coordinate the ten traffic signals along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard (i.e. from Laurel Grove
Avenue to Larkspur Landing Circle East) as a traffic signal group with 120 seconds cycle length.
Operate the traffic signals located at Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Elm Avenue, Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard/College Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Eliseo Drive as Free.

Plan 3
Coordinate the ten traffic signals along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard (i.e. from Laurel Grove
Avenue to Larkspur Landing Circle East) as a traffic signal group with 130 seconds cycle length.
Operate the traffic signals located at Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Elm Avenue, Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard/College Avenue and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Eliseo Drive as Free.

Signal Timing Evaluation
Weekday peak hour corridor system measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for the existing and
proposed timings are summarized in Tables V and VI respectively. Detailed calculations are
included in Appendix C.

Side street delays are not excessive due to the coordination of the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard corridor.

Table VII shows a comparison of the measures of effectiveness between the existing timing plans
and proposed timing plans. As shown in Table VII, the evaluation generally shows a reduction in
signal delay, stops per vehicle, total travel time, CO emissions, NOx emissions and an increase in
average speeds for the optimized timing plans compared with the existing timing plans for the Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard corridor.

in Table VIII, the evaluation generally shows a benefit in LOS for the optimized timing plans compared
with the existing timing plans for each intersection along the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard corridor.

Timing Plan Implementation

TJKM in collaboration with Caltrans staff and County staff implemented the proposed timing plans
on May 9, 2012. TJKM provided the final timing sheets containing cycle lengths, splits, and offsets
for the weekday a.m., weekday midday and weekday p.m. See Appendix E for the timing sheets.

GPS clocks were compatible with the model 170 controllers and installed at the following
intersections:
    1. SFDB/College Avenue
    2. SFDB/US-101 NB & SB Ramps (one model 170 controller operates both ramps)
    3. SFDB/Larkspur Landing Circle East
    4. SFDB/Larkspur Landing Circle West
Fine-Tuning
TJKM staff in collaboration with Caltrans staff and County staff monitored the operation of the
traffic signals with the implemented timing plans, and made adjustments to the offsets based upon
traffic conditions. The fine-tuning of the timing plans included driving along the study corridors,
identifying locations where vehicles stop, and refining the offsets to improve traffic flow.
Evaluation
The “After” implementation travel time surveys were conducted during the study peak periods for
the study corridors to determine the efficacy of the implemented and fine-tuned timing plans. The
measures of effectiveness (travel time, stop delay, probability of stopping, average speed, and free
speed) for the “After” study were compared with that of the “Before” study.

The following performance measures were obtained after implementing the timing plans. The
travel time surveys were conducted during the peak periods.

Sir Francis Drake Boulevard “After” Travel Time Survey Results
The average speed including stop delays, for a vehicle traveling along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
(between Elm Avenue to Larkspur Landing Circle East) ranges from 18 to 26 mph, among the
three peak period timing plans. The average travel time ranges from 6:09 to 9:33, while the
average signal delay ranges from 1:11 to 3:33; among the three peak period timing plans.

As shown in Table XI, the evaluation shows that the proposed timings generally offer significant
improvement over the existing timing as reflected by the magnitude of the percent reduction in
average travel times, average stop delays, number of stops, and percent increase in average speeds
and average free flow speeds for the peak periods.

TJKM also evaluated the capability of the existing model 170E traffic signal controller located at the
intersection of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and Wolfe Grade to determine the need for an
upgrade to a new model 2070. TJKM recommends changes to the 233 program software
programmable internal logic output for the yellow flashing arrow of the southbound right-turn
(phase 4) and westbound right-turn (phase 6) movements. By using the Flasher logic function, the
circuit will alternate circuit flashers with a one second rate; half second ON and half second OFF.

After changes have been made to the assignable outputs page of the timing sheet, the existing
traffic signal controller will be able to handle the yellow flashing arrows in conjunction with the
coordination plans during weekday a.m. peak, midday peak, and p.m. peak periods.

The evaluation includes a benefit/cost analysis to determine the amount of public benefit derived
from investing in the Program for Arterial System Synchronization (PASS) Project. The analysis
was conducted to account for improvement in traffic operation for autos. Travel time survey data
were mainly used for the analysis. See page 10 for a detailed description of auto travel time data
collection under the “Results of Floating Car Survey” section of this report.

Benefit/Cost Ratio Analysis
As shown in Table XII, the analysis shows a benefit/cost ratio (B/C) of approximately 82:1 for
autos, with a 13 percent increase in average speed, a 11 percent decrease in auto travel time (with
a decrease in traffic delay and number of stops), and 9 percent savings in fuel consumption/cost
along the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard corridor.

As indicated under the “before” conditions, it was observed that the a.m. and midday traffic signal
coordination timing plans provided “fairly” good traffic progression along Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard. The project is expected to result in a significant reduction in green house
gases/harmful emissions. Appendix F contains a detailed spreadsheet for the benefit/cost analysis
with all the assumptions that were considered in the analysis.

Other intrinsic benefits that were derived from investing in the signal timing project include
minimizing motorists’ frustration by reducing traffic congestion and delay. Specifically, traffic
congestion along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard between Elm Avenue and Larkspur Landing Circle
East has been reduced with the newly implemented traffic signal coordination plans. The
coordination plans as implemented, progresses the heavy commute directional traffic along the
study corridor which varies for the a.m. and the p.m. peak periods.

Other Benefits
Additionally, the PASS project provided an opportunity to update traffic signal timing parameters
for consistency with established guidelines as follows:
Traffic Safety Benefit
To enhance traffic safety, the yellow clearance timing parameters were updated based on posted
speed limits along the study corridor, and no changes were made to all red clearance timing
parameters as per Table IV. The yellow clearance times were revised at eleven out of the
twelve intersections along the Sir Francis Drake corridor between Elm Avenue and Larkspur
Landing Circle East. Therefore, all red clearance times were not adjusted at any study
intersections and yellow clearance times were adjusted at ninety two percent (92%) of the study
corridor.
Benefits to Pedestrians
The Walk timing and Flash Don’t Walk clearance timing parameters were also updated to provide
adequate time for children and seniors to safely cross the study intersections. The updated timing
parameters are expected to enhance the safe school crossings at Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/Wolfe
Grade Road and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard/College Avenue. The Flash Don’t Walk clearance
times were revised at nine out of the twelve intersections along the Sir Francis Drake corridor
between Elm Avenue and Larkspur Landing Circle East. These times represent the 3.5 feet per
second walking speed consistent with the 2010 MUTCD requirement. Therefore, the Walk times
were not adjusted at any intersections along the study corridor, while the Flash Don’t Walk
clearance times were adjusted at seventy five percent (75%) of the study corridor.
Benefits to Bicyclists
Per the new California policy directive, the minimum green time was increased for the through
movements at all study intersections to enhance traffic safety for bicyclists traveling along the Sir
Francis Drake Boulevard corridor between Elm Avenue and Larkspur Landing Circle East.
Therefore, the minimum green times were adjusted at one hundred percent (100%) of the study
corridor.

Conclusion

The traffic signal coordination plans are expected to promote uniform travel speeds along the
study corridor (i.e. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard from Elm Avenue to Larkspur Landing Circle East)
thereby reducing rear-end collisions. Implementing the timing plans has resulted in reducing traffic
congestion, automobile travel time, and reducing the emission of harmful greenhouse gases. Other
benefits include those stated in the preceding paragraphs.

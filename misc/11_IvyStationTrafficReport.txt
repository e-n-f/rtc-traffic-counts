EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report documents a Traffic Impact and Parking Analysis conducted for the proposed
Washington/National Mixed-Use project. The proposed project is located at the northwest corner of
Washington Boulevard and National Boulevard in the cities of Culver City and Los Angeles, with a small
portion of the project site located within the City of Los Angeles. The project is approximately 6.2 acres
and is expected to be constructed and operational in 2019. The key findings and conclusions of the
analysis are as follows:

    ·    As per the proposed site plan, the project site includes 10,000 square feet of High Turnover
         Restaurant, 10,000 of Quality Restaurant, 200 Mid-Rise Apartment Units, a Hotel with 148
         Rooms, 201 ksf of General Office space and 24 ksf of Retail Center. The proposed project site
         includes the conversion of existing 30,000 square feet of Mixed-Use land (10,000 square feet of
         Automobile Care Center, 8,000 square feet of Apparel Store and 12,000 square feet of Furniture
         Store) and Expo Light Rail Station 600 space surface parking lot.

    ·    The project site will include three levels of subterranean parking, including up to 300 spaces that
         will be provided to the Metro (Expo) Light Rail Station transit use.

    ·    As per the project site plan, there are 4 driveways proposed for the project - one along Venice
         Boulevard, two along National Boulevard, and one along Washington Boulevard. In addition, two
         truck delivery driveways are also proposed on Venice Boulevard. A review of the proposed
         driveways indicates that the driveway configurations are adequate for the project traffic
         circulation.

    ·    This traffic impact analysis includes an analysis of 15 intersections within the cities of Culver
         City and City of Los Angeles. These intersections were selected for analysis based on the
         discussions with LADOT and Culver City staff. Roadway improvements are currently being
         constructed in the project vicinity as part of the Expo Line Phase II project and these
         improvements were considered and included in this analysis.

    §    Trip credits were applied based on the existing land use for:
             - 30,000 square feet for existing Mixed-Use land
             - 300 parking spaces for Light Rail Transit Station
             - 10% Internal Capture (based upon ITE – 10% for Daily Trips, 10% for AM and 10% for
                 PM peak)
             - 25% of Transit Credits (based on the high land use density on the project site and 10-12
                 minute headways on Exposition Line)

    §    As per the site plan, the project is estimated to generate approximately 4,124 new daily trips, 256
         new trips during the AM peak hour and 301 new trips during the PM peak hour.

    §    Weekday peak hour intersection operations analysis was conducted for (4) scenarios including
         Existing (2014), Existing With Project (2014), Cumulative (2019), and Cumulative With Project
         (2019).

    §    For the Existing (2014) base conditions, one intersection operates at LOS F, 2 intersections
         operate at LOS D while the remaining 12 intersections operate at LOS C or better during the AM
         peak period. During the PM peak period, 2 intersections operate at LOS D while the remaining 13
         intersections operate at LOS C or better.

    §    For the Existing (2014) With Project conditions, one intersection is projected to operate at LOS F,
         2 intersections would operate at LOS D while the remaining 12 intersections would operate at
         LOS C or better during the AM peak period. During the PM peak period, 3 intersections are
         projected to operate at LOS D while the remaining 12 intersections would operate at LOS C or
         better.

    §    For the Cumulative (2019) base conditions, 2 intersections are projected to operate at LOS E, 2
         intersections are projected to operate at LOS D while the remaining 11 intersections are projected
         to operate at LOS C or better during the AM peak period. During the PM peak period, 4
         intersections are projected to operate LOS D while the remaining 11 intersections would operate
         at LOS C or better.

    §    For the Cumulative (2019) With Project conditions, 2 intersections are projected to operate at
         LOS E, 3 intersections are projected to operate at LOS D while the remaining 11 intersections
         (including the main project driveway) would operate at LOS C or better in the AM peak period.
         In the PM peak period, one intersection is projected to operate at LOS E, 3 intersections are
         projected to operate at LOS D while the remaining 12 intersections (including the main project
         driveway) would operate at LOS C or better. This scenario reflects that there is an increase in
         volume to capacity (V/C) ratio at the intersection of Robertson Boulevard and National
         Boulevard as well as National Boulevard and Venice Boulevard resulting in a significant impact.

    §    Based on City of Los Angeles significant impact criteria, the project would cause a significant
         impact at the intersections of National/Robertson. A Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
         plan with a cumulative target goal of 20% reduction in project traffic will increase capacity but
         does not fully mitigate the project’s impact. The recommended mitigation includes re-striping the
         eastbound approach to provide two left-turn, one through and one through-right lanes. The
         available roadway width would allow for an additional left-turn lane in the eastbound direction by
         re-striping without additional physical improvements to the intersection. Geometric constraints
         may exist for the eastbound left-turn movement and will be investigated during the design phase.

    §    Based on City of Los Angeles significant impact criteria, the project would cause a significant
         impact at the intersection of National/Venice. The recommended mitigation includes re-striping
         the northbound approach to provide two left-turn, two through and one right-turn lanes. The
         available roadway width along with the widening along the project frontage would allow for an
         additional right-turn lane in the northbound direction by re-striping without additional physical
         improvements to the intersection. This may require minor striping re-alignment for the north leg
         of National Boulevard. Upon mitigation, this intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
         LOS B in the PM peak period.

    §    As a result of the recommended mitigation for National/Robertson and National/Venice, a total of
         35 on-street parking spaces will be removed and 8 on-street spaces will be added.

    §    The proposed development would construct a Class II bicycle lane on National Boulevard
         between Washington Boulevard and Venice Boulevard in both directions and will serve as a key
         connection for bicyclists traveling between Washington Boulevard and Venice Boulevard. The
         proposed development would also be responsible for restriping Washington Boulevard and
         National Boulevard, including bicycle lanes on both sides of Washington Boulevard and National
         Boulevard.

    §    Based on the project trip generation and distribution patterns in the With Project conditions, the
         LOS at the study intersections and the LOS at Higuera Street/Robertson Boulevard and
         Washington Boulevard intersection, the project is not expected to result in impacts to the
         residential streets.

    §    A freeway impact screening analysis was conducted as per LADOT Traffic Study Guidelines.
         The project is expected to add less than 1% traffic to I-10 mainline and therefore no additional
         mainline analysis was required. For the intersection of I-10 westbound freeway off-ramp at
         Robertson Boulevard, the project would result in less than 2% increase in traffic during AM peak
         hour and PM peak hour and therefore no additional ramp analysis was required.

    §    The report also documents the findings of parking, access and circulation for the project site and
         proposed driveways. The analysis indicates that the proposed parking spaces and driveways are
         adequate.

    ·    A driveway queueing analysis was conducted due to close spacing between two (2) proposed site
         driveways on National Boulevard and nearby interactions of National Boulevard/Venice
         Boulevard and National Boulevard/Washington Boulevard. The queueing at the signalized
         driveway is not expected to cause blockage at nearby intersections under Future With Project
         conditions peak hour traffic. The analysis also indicates that the addition of a signalized
         driveway between the two existing signalized intersections on National Boulevard will not
         adversely impact the traffic operations on the corridor if appropriate turn pockets lengths and
         signal timing treatment are provided.

    ·    The location of bus stops adjacent to the proposed driveways was reviewed to mitigate any
         conflicts with the proposed site driveways. Only one of the 3 bus stops would have to be
         relocated to accommodate the proposed driveway located at Venice Boulevard south of Ellis
         Avenue.

Project Description

This Report documents the results of the Traffic Impact Analysis of the proposed Mixed-Use
Development for Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group. The proposed project is located at the northwest
corner of Washington Boulevard and National Boulevard in the cities of Culver City and Los Angeles.
The project includes 6.2 acres and is bounded by Venice Boulevard to the northwest, National Boulevard
to the northeast, Exposition Boulevard to the south, and Robertson Boulevard to the west. Figure 1
illustrates the study area and project location. The project is expected to be constructed by the year 2019.

The proposed project site includes a mix of land uses including a 10,000 SF of High Turnover Restaurant,
10,000 SF of Quality Restaurant, 200 Mid-Rise Apartment Units, a Hotel with 148 Rooms, 201 KSF of
General Office space and 24 KSF of Retail Center. The proposed project site includes the conversion of
existing 30,000 square feet of Mixed-Use land (10,000 square feet of Automobile Care Center, 8,000
square feet of Apparel Store and 12,000 square feet of Furniture Store) and Expo Light Rail Station 600
space surface parking lot.

The proposed project would require a minimum of 1,567 parking spaces based on the parking
requirements. The project would provide a total of 1,634 or more parking spaces which exceeds the
parking requirements based on the Straight ULI (Urban Land Institute) Shared Parking Manual 2 nd
Edition.

The access to the project site will be provided by one right-in/right-out access driveway along Venice
Boulevard, a full access signalized driveway along National Boulevard, a secondary right-in/right-out
access driveway along National Boulevard, and one right-in/right-out access driveway along Washington
Boulevard. In addition, two service/delivery driveways are provided along Venice Boulevard. The
driveway located along Washington Boulevard will provide access to the valet drop-off/pick-up for the
hotel. The project site plan and driveway locations are provided in Figure 2.

Study Methodology

A traffic impact analysis was conducted to analyze the traffic conditions in the project area under the
following four scenarios:

    1.   Existing (2014) Conditions
    2.   Existing With Project (2014) Conditions
    3.   Cumulative (2019) Conditions
    4.   Cumulative With Project (2019) Conditions

The project study area, future analysis and study intersections were defined in consultation with City of
Culver City and LADOT staff. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which outlined all the study
assumptions, growth rate, project trip generation and distribution, was submitted and approved by both
cities and is attached in Appendix A.

Existing (2014) conditions were analyzed using traffic count data collected during the month of
November 2014 and May 2015. A growth rate of 1%, approved in the MOU, was applied to Cumulative
(2019) scenarios.

Existing Traffic Volumes

The sections below include the peak hour traffic volumes, methodology utilized for this analysis, and
existing operating conditions at each study intersection.

Weekday traffic counts were conducted during the morning peak hours (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening
peak hours (4:00 to 6:00 PM) at 11 intersections on November 19 and November 20, 2014. Weekday
morning and afternoon traffic counts were also conducted at 4 additional intersections on May 13, 2015.
Due to the on-going construction related to Metro Expositions Light Rail Project, the lane geometry
utilized for the purpose of this analysis represents the future lane configuration at some study
intersections as noted in the following section of this report. Based upon our recent field check on July 2,
2015, these improvements have already been completed.

Level of Service Methodology

LADOT and Culver City traffic analysis guidelines require the use of the Transportation Research
Board’s Critical Movement Analysis (CMA), Circular 212 Planning Method, to analyze traffic operating
conditions at the study intersections. CMA is a method which determines the volume to capacity (V/C)
ratio on a critical lane basis and Level of Service (LOS) associated with each V/C ratio at a signalized
intersection. V/C ratios are measured on a scale of 0 to 1.000. LOS describes the quality of traffic flow
and is a measure of such factors as travel speed, travel time, and flow interruptions. LOS ranges from “A”
to “F”. Table 2 presents the volume to capacity ratio using the Circular 212 method. CMA calculation
(CMAC) spreadsheets were utilized in this analysis to determine the LOS at the study intersections.

                              Table 2 – Intersection Level of Service (LOS) Definitions
                     V/C Value
                     Signalized 1                                     Related LOS Rating

                       0 to 0.600          A – Excellent free flow conditions

                    0.601 to 0.700         B – Unconstrained flow

                    0.701 to 0.800         C – Somewhat constrained flow, maneuverability is reduced

                    0.801 to 0.900         D – Constrained flow, little maneuverability
                                           E – Significant vehicle queuing; not all vehicles clear intersection
                    0.901 to 1.000
                                           in one cycle
                     Greater than          F – Excessive delay; vehicles require more than one signal cycle
                        1.000              to clear the intersection
               1
                   Based upon Circular 212 methodology for signalized intersections

The City of Los Angeles and the City of Culver City defines a significant traffic impact at a signalized
intersection as an increase in demand according to the indices found on the following page.

City of Culver City Significant Impact Criteria

The threshold criteria for City of Culver City determines that a project impact is considered significant if
the following conditions are met:

         Intersection Condition With Project Traffic               Project-related Increase in V/C Ratio
                 LOS             V/C Ratio
                 C               0.701-0.800                         equal to or greater than 0.050
                 D               0.801-0.900                         equal to or greater than 0.040
                 E,F             > 0.900                             equal to or greater than 0.020

Using this criteria, a project would not have a significant impact at an intersection if it operates at LOS D
after the addition of the proposed project traffic and the incremental change in V/C is less than 0.040.
However, if the intersection is operating at LOS F after the addition of the proposed project traffic and the
V/C ratio is 0.020 or greater, the project would be considered to have a significant impact.

City of Los Angeles Significant Impact Criteria

The threshold criteria for City of Los Angeles, considers a project to have a significant impact if the
following conditions are met:

         Intersection Condition With Project Traffic               Project-related Increase in V/C Ratio
                 LOS             V/C Ratio
                 C               0.701-0.800                         equal to or greater than 0.040
                 D               0.801-0.900                         equal to or greater than 0.020
                 E,F              > 0.900                            equal to or greater than 0.010

Existing (2014) Conditions LOS Analysis

Existing traffic conditions were analyzed using new peak hour count data collected on November 19 and
20, 2014 and, May 13, 2015. The existing weekday peak hour (7:00 to 9:00 AM and 4:00 to 6:00 PM)
traffic counts were used to calculate the Existing (2014) conditions LOS. Traffic count worksheets are
provided in Appendix B of this report. Figure 4 illustrates the AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes for
the Existing (2014) conditions at each of the study intersections.

                                          III. PROJECT CONDITIONS

Project Trip Generation

The proposed Mixed-Use Development includes a total site area of approximately 6.2 acres and includes
10,000 SF of High Turnover Restaurant, 10,000 SF of Quality Restaurant, 200 Mid-Rise Apartment
Units, a Hotel with 148 Rooms, 201,000 SF of General Office space and 24,000 square feet of Retail
Center. The proposed project site includes the conversion of existing 30,000 square feet of Mixed-Use
land (10,000 square feet of Automobile Care Center, 8,000 square feet of Apparel Store and 12,000
square feet of Furniture Store. The project provides approximately 1,634 total parking spaces for the
proposed land uses.

Weekday daily, a.m. and p.m. peak hour trips were estimated for the project using trip generation rates
from the ITE publication entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition. Trip generation rates and the resulting trips
that would be generated by the proposed project are presented in Table 4 on the following page. The
project is estimated to generate approximately 4,124 new daily trips, 256 new trips during the AM peak
hour and 301 new trips during the PM peak hour.

Project Trip Credits

Trip credits were applied to the estimated project trip generation to account for internal capture and pass-
by trips based upon the guidelines approved by the City of Culver City and LADOT. Additionally, the
proposed project will result in a net reduction of 300 light rail station parking spaces that would require
project trip generation adjustments. ITE trip generation estimates allow for 1 trip credit per parking
space; however to represent a conservative scenario and due to limited data available from ITE trip
generation manual, only a 0.5 trip per parking space adjustment was taken into account based upon
consultation with LADOT. The trip credits that were applied are shown in Table 4. The estimated trip
generation was submitted to and approved by City of Culver City and LADOT staff as part of the MOU
process. The approved MOU is attached in Appendix A of this report.

Project Trip Distribution

Development of future traffic forecasts for the proposed project consisted of a three-step process that
includes project’s potential trip generation, trip distribution and traffic assignment to the street system
within the study area. Figure 6 provides the Project Trip Distribution approved by City of Culver City
utilized for all proposed project land uses. Figure 7 illustrates the Project peak hour volumes.

      Table 5 indicates that during the AM peak period, one intersection is projected to operate at LOS F, 2
      intersections would operate at LOS D while the remaining 12 intersections would operate at LOS C or
      better. During the PM peak period, 3 intersections are projected to operate at LOS D while the remaining
      12 intersections would operate at LOS C or better. In the AM peak period, there is an increase from 0.847
      to 0.867 in volume to capacity ratio at the intersection Robertson Boulevard at National Boulevard when
      compared against the Existing (2014) Without Project conditions. Peak hour analysis worksheets for the
      Existing (2014) With Project conditions are provided in Appendix C of this report. The peak hour traffic
      volumes for the Existing (2014) With Project conditions at each of the study intersections are illustrated
      in Figure 8.

Related Projects Trip Generation and Assignment

Traffic volumes from related projects (approved or pending projects expected to be built by the year 2019
in the proposed project vicinity) were added to the study intersections to simulate future traffic conditions
with expected new growth in development in the area. The list of related projects was obtained from City
of Culver City. Related projects that were constructed and operational were not included as part of the
related projects analysis.

Table 6 lists the related projects and the trips generated by each related project based upon trip generation
rates from the ITE publication entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition. Figure 9 illustrates the location of
these related projects and Figure 10 provides the projected peak hour trips for these related projects.

Cumulative (2019) Base Conditions

The Cumulative (2019) Base Conditions traffic represents the sum of existing volumes, ambient growth
and the traffic estimated from related projects. These volumes were assigned to the future baseline
network that will be in place at the time the project is completed. As per the information and direction
provided by LADOT and Culver City staff, 21 approved projects within a one-mile radius were included
in this traffic impact analysis.

Regional ambient traffic growth was estimated as an annual percentage increase over the existing traffic
volumes. A growth rate of 1.0% per year was applied to the peak hour traffic volumes to represent year
2019 traffic volumes, in accordance with discussions with LADOT and Culver City staff. The 1.0%
increase per year is anticipated to account for projects that will be built by 2019 within the project
vicinity. While this rate is slightly higher than the annual growth rate of 0.5% identified in Congestion
Management Program for Los Angeles County (CMP) (Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, 2010), it was used to provide for a more a conservative analysis of Cumulative traffic
conditions. Due to the fact that this project is located in an urban setting, it is unlikely that there will be a
higher percentage of growth.

       Cumulative (2019) With Project traffic conditions add the estimated project traffic to the Cumulative
       Base conditions and are used to evaluate the net change in the traffic conditions and to identify potential
       traffic impacts associated with the proposed project. The Cumulative (2019) With Project traffic volumes
       represent the sum of existing traffic volumes raised by ambient growth factor, the traffic estimated from
       related projects, and the project trips. These volumes were assigned to the future baseline network that

Driveway Access Review

As per the site plan, 4 driveways are proposed for providing access to the site. One driveway would be
located along Venice Boulevard and would provide right-in right-out access to/from the project site for
parking and delivery. One driveway located along Venice Boulevard, north of Ellis Avenue, would
provide access and parking to service and delivery trucks. A service and fire access driveway are also
provided along Venice Boulevard frontage. One driveway located along National Boulevard, adjacent to
Venice Boulevard, would provide full signalized access to/from the project site. Another driveway along
National Boulevard, adjacent to Washington Boulevard would provide right-in right-out access to the
project site. The 4th driveway will be located along Washington Boulevard and would provide in/out
right-turn-only access to the project site main parking area as well as valet parking for the proposed hotel.

Driveway Queueing Analysis

Due to close spacing between the two (2) proposed site driveways on National Boulevard and nearby
intersections of National Boulevard/Venice Boulevard and National Boulevard/Washington Boulevard,
the queue lengths along National Boulevard under Future With Project conditions peak hour traffic were
calculated. One of the driveways is proposed to be a signalized intersection. A Synchro microsimulation
analysis was completed to determine these queue lengths as well as to determine any traffic operational
issues at the adjacent intersections. The results indicated that the 85 th percentile queue in the southbound
direction at the signalized driveway is 106 feet in the PM peak. In the northbound direction, the 85 th
percentile queue is 46 feet in the PM peak. A supplemental memo with additional details are included in
Appendix D.

Bicycle Network

There is a Class II dedicated bicycle lane along Venice Boulevard in both east and west directions. The
City of Los Angeles Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan is found in Appendix G. A bicycle path (Class I) was
constructed along most of the Expo Light Rail alignment except between National Boulevard/Wesley
Street and Venice Boulevard/Robertson Boulevard. The city of Culver City is proposing to include a
Class III (bike route) on Wesley Street and stripe Class II bike lanes on Washington Boulevard between
Wesley Street and National Boulevard. The proposed development would construct a Class II bicycle lane
on National Boulevard between Washington Boulevard and Venice Boulevard in both directions and will
serve as a key connection for bicyclists traveling between Washington Boulevard and Venice Boulevard.
These improvements combined with the City proposed improvements would result in a well-connected
bicycle network in this area. The proposed development would also be responsible for restriping
Washington Boulevard and National Boulevard, including bicycle lanes on both sides of Washington
Boulevard and National Boulevard.

Project Impacts

Based on the significant impact criteria as defined by City of Los Angeles, the proposed project would
have a significant impact at the intersections of National Boulevard/Robertson Boulevard and National
Boulevard/Venice Boulevard. In the AM peak period, there is an increase from 0.930 to 0.950 in volume
to capacity at the intersection of Robertson Boulevard at National Boulevard when compared against the
Cumulative Without Project conditions. In the PM peak period, there is an increase from 0.708 to 0.756 in
volume to capacity at the intersection of National Boulevard at Venice Boulevard. Mitigation measures
and other needed improvements as outlined in the following section were needed to bring the LOS at
these two intersections to a minimum acceptable LOS D as well as to mitigate any queueing issues at
these intersections.

Recommended Mitigation Measures

The significant impact at National/Robertson intersection can be mitigated by re-striping the eastbound
approach to provide two left-turn, one through and one through-right lanes. The available roadway width
would allow for an additional left-turn lane in the eastbound direction by re-striping without additional
physical improvements to the intersection. Reduced lane widths for eastbound through and left turns lanes
are proposed to allow sufficient width for the westbound receiving lane. This is expected to mitigate the
LOS from D to an acceptable LOS C in the AM peak period for Existing (2014) With Project conditions
at from LOS E to an acceptable LOS D in the AM peak period for Cumulative (2019) With Project
conditions. Mitigation for National/Robertson is shown in Appendix F.

The significant impact at National/Venice intersection can be mitigated by re-striping the northbound
approach to provide two left-turn, two through and one right-turn lanes. The available roadway width
along with the widening along the project frontage would allow for an additional right-turn lane in the
northbound direction by re-striping without additional physical improvements to the intersection. This
may require minor striping re-alignment for the north leg of National Boulevard. Upon mitigation, this
intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable LOS B in the PM peak period. A full size exhibit
showing the proposed lane configuration as well on-street parking changes is included at the end of the
report. Mitigation for National/Venice is shown in Appendix F.

Additionally, a southbound right turn lane is recommended at the intersection of Washington/National
and Main Project Driveway/National to mitigate queuing issues at these intersections. These mitigation
improvements are also shown in Appendix F.

As a result of the recommended mitigation for National/Robertson and National/Venice, a total of 35 on-
street parking spaces will be removed and 8 on-street spaces will be added. Table 9 presents the location
of both removed and added on-street parking in Culver City and the City of Los Angeles.

Neighborhood Traffic Assessment

Based upon the input from local community, potential impacts to neighboring residential streets were
qualitatively assessed to see if the proposed project would result in increased cut-through traffic on
residential streets, specifically Higuera Street. Residential streets typically experience cut-through traffic
when the adjacent intersections operate at or exceed their capacity levels. Higuera Street is the primary
collector street that connects several residential streets southeast of the project site.

Final Draft Traffic Impact Analysis                    39                                         October 2015
A review of the “With Project” LOS at the intersections of Higuera Street/Washington Boulevard/
Robertson Boulevard and Washington Boulevard/National Boulevard indicate “D” or better conditions.
The increase in project related traffic at the intersection of Higuera Street/Washington
Boulevard/Robertson Boulevard is fairly minor. Because of the additional available capacity at these
intersections as well as the minimal amount of project traffic that would be going through Higuera
Street/Washington Boulevard/National Boulevard, the project is not expected to result in or increase any
cut-through traffic through these residential streets.


Congestion Management Plan (CMP) Compliance

The Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMP) was developed in response to
California Proposition 111, approved June 1990, and is intended to address regional congestion by linking
land use, transportation, and air quality decisions.

Among the elements of the CMP is a land use analysis program which "requires local jurisdictions to
analyze the impacts of land use decisions on the regional transportation system, for projects preparing an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR)."

The CMP document identifies the County's CMP Highway System, and requires that Level of Service E
or better be maintained on this network. The I-10 Freeway and the intersection of Venice/La Cienega
Blvd are the nearest CMP facilities in the study area.

Analysis of a project’s impact on a freeway segment would be required of any project that would add 150
trips or more in either direction during the AM or PM weekday peak hours. The project will not generate
this level of traffic in either peak hour. Therefore, further analysis of CMP facilities is not required for
CMP purposes.

An analysis of CMP monitored intersections is required if a project contributes 50 or more peak hour trips
to the CMP monitored intersections. The project will not contribute 50 or more peak hour trips to this
intersection, and therefore, additional evaluation for CMP purposes is not needed.

Freeway Impact Screening Analysis

A freeway impact screening analysis was conducted as per LADOT Traffic Study Guidelines. The
methodology from the agreement between City of Los Angeles and Caltrans District 7 on freeway impact
analysis procedures was used for the freeway impact screening analysis. As per the criteria provided by
the agreement, if the proposed project meets any of the following criteria, the applicant will be directed to
work with Caltrans and to prepare freeway impact analysis, utilizing Caltrans’ “Guide for the Preparation
of Traffic Impact Studies”.

    ·    The project’s peak hour trips would result in a 1% or more increase to the freeway mainline
         capacity of a freeway segment operating at LOS E or F (based on an assumed capacity of 2,000
         vehicles per hour per lane); or
    ·    The project’s peak hour trips would result in a 2% or more increase to the freeway mainline
         capacity of a freeway segment operating at LOS D (based on an assumed capacity of 2,000
         vehicles per hour per lane); or
    ·    The project’s peak hour trips would result in a 1% or more increase to the capacity of a freeway
         off-ramp operating at LOS E or F (based on an assumed ramp capacity of 1,500 vehicles per hour
         per lane); or
    ·    The project’s peak hour trips would result in a 2% or more increase to the capacity of a freeway
         off-ramp operating at LOS D (based on an assumed ramp capacity of 1,500 vehicles per hour per
         lane).

Freeway Mainline Analysis

The above criteria was used for the freeway mainline analysis for this project. Based on the available
freeway mainline traffic data from Caltrans, the project is expected to add less than 1% traffic to I-10
mainline capacity and therefore does not meet the mainline capacity criteria provided above. Project trips
on the I-10 mainline freeway in the study area during the AM and PM peak hours are shown in the
following table. The existing I-10 freeway in the study area is operating at LOS E based upon Highway
Capacity Software (HCS) software. The LOS worksheets are attached to Appendix E. Per the 1% criteria
on freeway mainline, the project would need to add 80 trips in the eastbound (EB) and westbound (WB)
directions during the AM and PM peak hours to meet the traffic impact analysis requirement.

As shown in Table 10, the project is projected to add between 4 to 18 trips to the freeway mainline in
each direction. Because the project trips are less than the required 80 trips, a freeway impact analysis is
not required.

Freeway Ramp Analysis

The above criteria was used for the freeway off-ramp analysis for this project. Project trips on the I-10
freeway off-ramp at Robertson Boulevard during the AM and PM peak hours are shown in the
following table. The freeway off-ramp is currently operating and projected to operate at LOS C in the
AM peak hour and LOS B in the PM peak hour based upon Highway Capacity Software (HCS)
software. The LOS worksheets are attached to Appendix E.

As shown in Table 11, the project would need to add 30 new trips on the freeway off-ramp during the
AM and PM peak hours if the 2% criteria for the freeway off-ramp was used, the project would need to
add 15 new trips on the freeway off-ramp during the AM and PM peak hours to meet the traffic impact
analysis requirements. The project is projected to add 18 new trips during the AM peak hour and 13
new trips during the PM peak hour. Because the new trips during the AM peak hour or PM peak hour
does not meet the 2% criteria for the off-ramp, further freeway off-ramp is not required.

                                                 IV. CONCLUSION

This report documents the results of a traffic impact analysis completed for the proposed Mixed-Use
Development project located at the northwest corner of Washington Boulevard and National Boulevard in
the cities of Culver City and Los Angeles. The project will replace existing land uses that include
Automobile Care Center, Apparel Store, and two Furniture Stores. The following summarizes our key
findings and conclusions:

    ·    The proposed project site includes a mix of uses including a 10,000 square feet of High Turnover
         Restaurant, 10,000 square feet of Quality Restaurant, 200 Mid-Rise Apartment Units, a Hotel
         with 148 Rooms, 201,000 square feet of General Office space and 24,000 square feet of Retail
         Center. The proposed project site includes the conversion of existing 30,000 square feet of
         Mixed-Use land (10,000 square feet of Automobile Care Center, 8,000 square feet of Apparel
         Store and 12,000 square feet of Furniture Store) and Expo Light Rail Station 600 space surface
         parking lot.

    ·    The project site will include three levels of subterranean parking, including up to 300 spaces that
         will be provided to the Metro (Expo) Light Rail Station transit use.

    ·    The project will provide access to the site via 4 driveways - one along Venice Boulevard, two
         along National Boulevard, and one along Washington Boulevard in addition to two truck delivery
         and fire access driveways located on Venice Boulevard. The driveway analysis indicates that the
         proposed driveways are adequate for the project traffic circulation.

    ·    A driveway queueing analysis was conducted due to close spacing between two (2) proposed site
         driveways on National Boulevard and nearby interactions of National Boulevard/Venice
         Boulevard and National Boulevard/Washington Boulevard. The queuing at the main signalized
         driveway is not expected to cause blockage at nearby intersections under Future With Project
         conditions peak hour traffic.

    §    This traffic impact analysis analyzed 15 intersections within the cities of Culver City and Los
         Angeles.

    §    The project is estimated to generate approximately 4,124 new daily trips, 256 new trips during the
         AM peak hour and 301 new trips during the PM peak hour.

    §    This Traffic Impact Analysis concludes that the proposed project would generate a significant
         impact at the intersections of National Boulevard and Robertson Boulevard as well as National
         Boulevard and Venice Boulevard based on City of Los Angeles significant traffic impact criteria.

    §    The significant impact at National/Robertson intersection cannot be mitigated by a TDM plan
         with a cumulative goal of 20% reduction in project traffic. The significant impact can be
         mitigated by re-striping the eastbound approach to provide two left-turn, one through and one
         through-right lanes. The available roadway width would allow for an additional left-turn lane in
         the eastbound direction by re-striping without additional physical improvements to the
         intersection. Geometric constraints may exist for the eastbound left-turn movement and will be
         investigated during the design phase.

    §    The significant impact at National/Venice intersection can be mitigated by re-striping the
         northbound approach to provide two left-turn, two through and one right-turn lanes. The available
         roadway width would allow for an additional right-turn lane in the northbound direction by re-
         striping without additional physical improvements to the intersection. This may require minor
         striping re-alignment for the north leg of National Boulevard. Upon mitigation, this intersection is
         expected to operate at an acceptable LOS B in the PM peak period.

    §    As a result of the recommended mitigation for National/Robertson and National/Venice, a total of
         35 on-street parking spaces will be removed and 8 on-street parking spaces will be added.

    §    The proposed development would construct a Class II bicycle lane on National Boulevard
         between Washington Boulevard and Venice Boulevard in both directions and will serve as a key
         connection for bicyclists traveling between Washington Boulevard and Venice Boulevard. The
         proposed development would also be responsible for restriping Washington Boulevard and
         National Boulevard, including bicycle lanes on both sides of Washington Boulevard and National
         Boulevard.

    §    Based on the project trip generation and distribution patterns in the With Project conditions, the
         LOS at the study intersections and the LOS at Higuera Street/Robertson Boulevard and
         Washington Boulevard intersection, the project is not expected to result in impacts to the
         residential streets.

    §    A freeway impact screening analysis was conducted as per LADOT Traffic Study Guidelines.
         The project is expected to add less than 1% traffic to I-10 mainline and therefore no additional
         mainline analysis was required. For the intersection of I-10 westbound freeway off-ramp at
         Robertson Boulevard, the project would result in less than 2% increase in traffic during AM peak
         hour and PM peak hour and therefore no additional ramp analysis was required.

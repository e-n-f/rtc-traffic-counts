Introduction



1. INTRODUCTION
This traffic study summarizes the analysis of potential transportation impacts associated with the
proposed commercial and residential mixed-use infill development at 1900 Fourth Street in West
Berkeley, herein referred to as the “proposed Project”. The scope of work is included in Appendix A.
The Project site plan is shown in Figure 1.

As currently proposed, the proposed Project includes construction of two separate buildings with 155
dwelling units (151,738 gross square feet of residential space), and a total of 30,000 square feet of
retail and restaurant space (including 25,000 square feet of specialty retail and 5,000 square feet of
high-quality restaurant space).1 The Project proposes to provide a six-level parking garage, with a total
of 372 parking spaces, on the southwest corner of the site. A residential driveway would be located on
Hearst Avenue and a commercial driveway would be located on Fourth Street. The lower three levels
would consist of a commercial parking garage, with 214 public parking spaces. The upper three levels
would provide 158 parking spaces for project residents. Two off-street loading spaces would be
provided near the north entrance of the garage

The proposed Project site plan is included in Appendix B.

This study addresses the traffic, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, loading, emergency vehicle access and
construction related impacts of the proposed Project. Intersection Level of Service (LOS) is evaluated
for study intersections for the weekday AM and PM peak hours and the weekend (Saturday) peak hour.
The effects of the proposed Project on parking and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is included for
informational purposes.

The analysis evaluates conditions under the following scenarios and identifies the transportation-
related impacts of the proposed Project:

     •    Existing (Year 2016)
     •    Existing plus Approved
     •    Existing plus Approved plus Project
     •    Cumulative (Year 2040)
     •    Cumulative plus Project

The Existing plus Approved scenario reflects existing traffic conditions with approved projects using
information provided by the City of Berkeley. The Cumulative Conditions scenario reflects future (Year
2040) traffic conditions using outputs from the Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda
CTC) travel demand model with approved and reasonably foreseeable projects.

    The proposed Specialty Retail space would include a mix of commercial retail and about 5,000 square feet of quick serve restaurant space.

Introduction



1.1. PROJECT LOCATION
The proposed Project consists of a commercial and residential mixed-use infill development on two
parcels in West Berkeley, 1900 Fourth Street (Assessor’s Parcel Number 057-2101-001) and 701
University Avenue (Assessor’s Parcel Number 057-2101-005). The site is located in the Fourth Street
Node of the West Berkeley Commercial (C-W) zoning district. The Berkeley General Plan land use
designation is Avenue Commercial with a Development Node overlay. The proposed Project lies within
the boundaries of the plan area for the West Berkeley Plan (1993) and the West Berkeley Circulation
Master Plan (WBCMP) (Wilbur Smith Associates, May 2009).
As shown in Figure 1, the proposed Project site is located on the west side of Fourth Street and
encompasses the entire block bounded by Hearst Avenue to the north, University Avenue North
Frontage Road to the south, Fourth Street to the east, and Third Street/Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR)
tracks to the west. The 2.2 acre site is currently occupied by a vacant one-story building (701 University
Avenue) and a privately owned 347 space surface parking lot which is open to the public for a fee.
Ingress and egress to the parking lot is provided by two separate one-way driveways located on Fourth
Street.


1.2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
As currently proposed, the mixed-use residential and commercial (retail and residential) development
will consist of 135 apartment units, and 33,080 square feet of commercial space, which is currently
anticipated to include 14,850 square feet of restaurant space and 18,230 square feet of retail space.
The Project proposes to provide a six-level parking garage, with a total of 372 parking spaces, on the
southwest corner of the site. A residential driveway would be located on Hearst Avenue and a
commercial driveway would be located on Fourth Street. The upper three levels of the parking garage
would include 158 residential parking spaces and 214 publicly accessible spaces would be provided on
the lower levels. Of the 372 total parking stalls, 17 would be Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
compliant spaces with two to three ADA spaces provided on each floor.
In addition to the proposed off-street parking spaces, the Project proposes to increase publicly available
on-street parking by nine spaces. With curb modifications proposed by the Project, ten on-street
parking spaces would be added along the Fourth Street frontage and one on-street parking space would
be eliminated along the Hearst Avenue frontage.
The proposed Project would provide a total of 345 bicycle parking spaces, including 60 parking spaces
located in within a designated bike storage room within the garage for commercial tenants, 26 short-
term bicycle parking spaces and three cargo bicycle spaces in racks near ground floor entrances to
commercial use. For residents, 256 long-term secure bicycle parking spaces and a separate bicycle
repair space would be provided in a bicycle repair and storage room adjacent to University Avenue.
The proposed Project site plan is illustrated in Figure 2 and included in Appendix B.

Introduction


1.2.1. Vehicular Access
As shown in Figure 2, vehicles destined for the residential units would access the proposed garage from
a two-way entry/exit driveway on Hearst Avenue. Vehicles destined for the commercial uses would
access the proposed garage from a two-way entry/exit driveway on Fourth Street. The Project proposes
to utilize one of the two existing curb cuts on Hearst Avenue and Fourth Street to provide access to the
proposed residential and commercial garages, respectively.


1.2.2. Pedestrian Access
Pedestrian access to both buildings would be provided through entrances located along Hearst Avenue,
Fourth Street, University Avenue, and a public pedestrian pathway, or paseo, connecting Hearst Avenue
and Fourth Street, internal to the site. Two residential lobbies would be provided on University Avenue
with additional entryways on Hearst Avenue, the paseo, and the parking garage. The ground-floor
commercial retail and residential uses would have independent pedestrian entrances located on the
building’s Fourth Street, Hearst Avenue and University Avenue frontages as well as from the paseo,
internal to the site. Two outdoor elevated pedestrian walkways would connect the second and third
levels of the two buildings, near the Hearst Avenue frontage.


1.2.3. Bicycle Access
The proposed Project is located immediately adjacent to a designated bike route (i.e., Hearst Avenue)
and is located near several other streets that provide designated bicycle facilities. Bicyclists would be
expected to travel along a combination of designated routes and other streets to access the proposed
Project. Bicyclists destined for the proposed residential bicycle storage room on University Avenue
would dismount at the northwest corner of Fourth Street / University Avenue North Frontage Road and
access the facility from a pedestrian entrance located on the north side of University Avenue. Bicyclists
destined for the proposed commercial bicycle storage room in the commercial parking garage would
travel along Fourth Street and use the proposed driveway to reach the facility.


1.2.4. Loading Access
The Project proposes to provide two off-street loading spaces (12 feet wide and 25 feet long) in the
residential garage to accommodate delivery service and residential move-in and move-out activities. It
is anticipated that some daily deliveries (e.g., Federal Express, United States Postal Service) would be
accommodated in the existing loading (white curb) zone located immediately east of the residential
driveway on Hearst Avenue.


1.2.5. Garbage, Recycling, and Green Waste Collection
Garbage, recycling, and green waste (or compost) storage for the residential (apartment) and
commercial restaurant and retail uses would be conducted in designated areas located within the
proposed garage. Building management would be responsible for rolling garbage, recycling, and green

waste bins curbside for collection. Consistent with current trash and recycling collection practice, trucks
would have direct access to the curbside collection area from nearby loading zones or on-street parking
spaces. If these spaces are occupied and trucks are unable to pull over to the curb, trucks will
temporarily block the adjacent travel lane during collection.


1.2.6. Emergency Vehicle Access
Emergency vehicle access to the Project site would be provided from Hearst Avenue, Fourth Street, and
University Avenue North Frontage Road. The Project does not propose modifications to the roadway
network or major modifications (circulation patterns or design features) to streets adjacent to the
Project site.


1.3. STUDY SCOPE AND APPROACH
This transportation study was prepared according to the approved scope of work (dated February 8,
2016) included as Appendix A. The following scenarios were evaluated to identify the potential
transportation impacts of the proposed Project:
     •    Existing Conditions. Existing (Year 2016) traffic volumes and roadway conditions in the vicinity
          of the proposed Project;
     •    Existing plus Approved Conditions. Existing (Year 2016) traffic volumes and roadway conditions
          accounting for approved and reasonably foreseeable projects located in the vicinity of the
          proposed Project;
     •    Existing plus Approved plus Project Conditions. This scenario is identical to Existing plus
          Approved Conditions, but with the addition of traffic generated by the proposed 1900 Fourth
          Street mixed-use development. This scenario is also referred to as the Baseline Conditions;
     •    Cumulative Conditions. This scenario utilizes traffic forecasts for future year 2040 developed
          using growth rates derived from the Alameda CTC travel demand model considering future
          development with the addition of traffic generated by approved and reasonably foreseeable
          projects and considering planned improvements to the transportation and circulation network
          in the vicinity of the proposed Project; and
     •    Cumulative plus Project Conditions. This scenario is identical to Cumulative Conditions, but
          with the addition of traffic generated by the proposed 1900 Fourth Street mixed-use
          development.


1.3.1. Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Intersection level of Service (LOS) was analyzed at seven study intersections that were selected in
coordination with City staff and represent locations where based on the trip generation, distribution
and assignment, the proposed Project has the potential to impact intersection operations. Intersection
analysis locations and the parking study area are illustrated in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 1.

Consistent with the City of Berkeley Office of Transportation’s Guidelines for Development of Traffic
Impact Reports (City Guidelines) (September 2005) and the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans’) Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (Caltrans’ Guidelines) (December 2002),
all seven study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours. Additionally, as
the proposed Project includes a substantial amount of commercial space, the weekend (Saturday)
midday peak hour was also evaluated. The weekday AM and PM and Saturday midday peak hours are
defined as the peak one hour (comprised of four consecutive 15-minute intervals) of the weekday AM
and PM and Saturday midday peak periods (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, and 1:00 PM to
3:00 PM, respectively).2

Intersections were analyzed using Trafficware’s Synchro 8 Software and according to the Highway
Capacity Manual (2000 HCM) methodology, which uses quantitative measures of traffic conditions
(turning movement volumes, signal timing information, roadway geometric configurations) to
determine capacity, average delay, and other operational performance measures at an intersection, of
which the most widely used is the level of service.3 Level of service provides a qualitative description of
the performance of an intersection based on average delay per vehicle. Intersection LOS ranges from
LOS A, which indicates free flow or excellent conditions with short delays, to LOS F, which indicates
congested or overloaded conditions with extremely long delays. Intersection LOS criteria are
summarized in Table 2.

For signalized and all way stop control intersections, LOS and delay are reported as an average across all
movements and approaches. For one-way and two-way stop controlled intersections, LOS and delay are
reported for the worst stop-controlled approach (or yield movement).




2
    For purposes of the intersection level of service analysis, a system-wide peak hour was selected for each peak period.
3
    As part of the HCM methodology, adjustments are typically made to the capacity of each intersection to account for various factors that reduce
    the ability of the streets to accommodate vehicles (such as the Downtown nature of the area, number of pedestrians, vehicle types, lane widths,
    grades, on-street parking and queues). These adjustments are performed to ensure that the LOS analysis results reflect the operating conditions
    that are observed in the field.

  1.3.2. Signal Warrant Analysis
 Unsignalized intersections operating at poor LOS (i.e., LOS E or F) are evaluated to determine whether
 or not they meet the California Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA-MUTCD) Peak Hour
 Signal Warrants (Section 4C.04, Warrant 3). This includes both Category A (Peak Hour Delay Warrant)
 and Category B (Peak Hour Volume Warrant) of CA-MUTCD Warrant 3.

 For Category A (Peak Hour Delay Warrant), the criteria are met if all three of the following are satisfied:

                  The total stopped time delay experienced by the traffic on one minor-street approach (one
                   direction only) controlled by a stop sign equals or exceeds: four vehicle-hours for a one-lane
                   approach; or five vehicle-hours for a two-lane approach;
                  The volume of the same minor-street approach (one direction only) equals or exceeds 100
                   vehicles per hour for one moving lane of traffic or 150 vehicles per hour for two moving
                   lanes; and
                  The total entering volume serviced during the hour equals or exceeds 650 vehicles per hour
                   for intersections with three approaches or 800 vehicles per hour for intersections with four
                   or more approaches.
 For Category B (Peak Hour Volume Warrant), the peak hour volumes are tested, as a function of the
 number of approach lanes for both the minor and major street approaches. Category B criteria is met if
 the plotted points for vehicles per hour fall above the applicable curve in CA-MUTCD Figure 4C-3.


  1.3.3. At-Grade Railroad Crossing Assessment
 The Project site is located adjacent to a rail corridor with an at-grade railroad crossing located on the
 northwest corner of the site on Hearst Avenue. The operational and safety implications of the Hearst
 Avenue at-grade rail crossing will be assessed for all modes.

                                                                           10                                 Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

Introduction


1.3.4. CMP Analysis
Based on the expected trip generation potential of the proposed Project (i.e., more than 100 peak hour
vehicle trips), an Alameda CTC Congestion Management Program (CMP) analysis of the proposed
Project’s effect on CMP and Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) roadways is required per the CMP Land
Use Analysis Program.

The designated CMP roadway network includes state highways and principal arterials that carry 30,000
vehicles per day; have four or more lanes; are major cross-town connectors; and connect at both ends
to another CMP route or major activity center. The Alameda CTC adopted a two-tier approach for the
CMP network in 2011. The first tier (Tier 1) is the existing CMP network and the second tier (Tier 2)
consists of an expanded number of roadways that forms a supplemental network that is monitored for
informational purposes. The MTS system is a regionally designated system that includes the entire CMP
network as well as major arterials, transit services, rail, maritime ports, airports, and transfer hubs and
includes roadways recognized as “regionally significant” as well as all interstate highways, state routes,
and portions of the local street network.

The following MTS roadway segments in the vicinity of the Project site were selected for analysis based
on the proposed project trip distribution and assignment and in consultation with City of Berkeley and
Alameda CTC staff.

     •    I-80/I-580, south of University Avenue
     •    I-80/I-580, north of University Avenue
     •    San Pablo Avenue, south of University Avenue
     •    San Pablo Avenue, north of University Avenue
     •    Sixth Street, south of University Avenue
     •    Sixth Street, north of University Avenue
     •    University Avenue, east of Sixth Street
     •    University Avenue, west of Sixth Street


CMP level of service analysis for MTS roadway segments was performed based on the service volume
tables from the Highway Capacity Manual, as shown in Table 1. A volume to capacity ratio was
calculated using the volumes from the Alameda CTC model and the LOS F service volume threshold as
the estimate for roadway capacity.

                    spaced. Any incident can cause backups that propagate upstream.
      F              Roadway operates beyond capacity, with significant queuing at                > 1.00
                     bottlenecks such as key intersections or lane drops. Vehicles are
                       closely spaced and maneuverability is extremely restricted.

1.3.5. Transit Assessment
Consistent with the methodologies outlined in the Guidelines, the assessment of impacts was based on
the location of bus stops, transit service and ridership. Project-generated transit trips was estimated
and the effect of increased ridership at transit stops that serve the proposed Project site was evaluated.
Potential impacts to transit that were assessed include effects of Project-generated vehicle traffic on
mixed flow transit operations and transit access/egress.


1.3.6. Pedestrian Assessment
Pedestrian conditions throughout the study area were qualitatively assessed, including sidewalk widths,
compliance with ADA accessibility requirements, existing activity levels, and the number of new
pedestrian trips that would be added to the network. The adequacy of pedestrian connections to
nearby transit routes was determined and potential pedestrian safety issues were identified, including
potential conflicts between vehicular traffic and pedestrian circulation. Impacts to pedestrian
conditions as a result of Project-generated activities were qualitatively assessed in accordance with the
Berkeley Pedestrian Master Plan (adopted June 22, 2010). Potential impacts of the proposed Project to
pedestrian in Pedestrian Plan Areas of Countywide Significance were also addressed.


1.3.7. Bicycle Assessment
Bicycle conditions throughout the study area were qualitatively assessed as they relate to the proposed
Project study area—including safety and right-of-way issues—and existing and potential new bicycle


                                                                        12                      Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

facilities were identified. Impacts to bicycle conditions as a result of Project-generated activities,
including Project-generated traffic and driveway movements, were qualitatively assessed in accordance
with the Berkeley Bicycle Plan (update adopted February 22, 2005, update currently under way).
Potential impacts of the proposed Project to bicyclists on the Countywide Bicycle Network and
Countywide facilities were also addressed.


1.3.8. Loading Assessment
Existing loading conditions and activity was examined on streets surrounding the Project site. Loading
conditions and restrictions were determined and the Project’s proposed supply of loading spaces was
compared against Berkeley Municipal Code requirements. The impacts of the proposed Project’ loading
activities—including location, design, and control—on traffic, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle conditions
were also qualitatively assessed.


1.3.9. Emergency Vehicle Access Assessment
Emergency vehicle access to and from the proposed Project site was qualitatively assessed for
adequacy.


1.3.10.              Parking Assessment
Existing parking conditions were examined for all on-street and off-street publicly-accessible parking
facilities within a two-block radius of the Project site (bounded by Virginia Street to the north, Allston
Way to the south, Second Street to the west, and Sixth Street to the east), which represents the typical
distance that most people would be willing to park and walk to their destination. This parking study
incorporates and builds upon the parking assessment included in the Preliminary Transportation
Assessment (Fehr & Peers, 2015) (Appendix C). Parking occupancy counts were collected in the study
area on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday (September 12 to 14, 2014) from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM and on
Tuesday evening (February 3, 2016) from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, which represent the typical peak period
of parking demand for commercial and residential uses.

The Project’s proposed supply of parking was compared against Berkeley Municipal Code requirements.
The Project’s peak parking demand was estimated based on a survey at the Fourth and U apartments
for the residential component and the Urban Land Institute (ULI) Shared Parking Model, accounts for
factors such as non-auto mode share and shared parking across different land uses, was used to
estimate peak parking demand for the commercial component. The impacts of Project-related parking
activities—including location, design, and control—on traffic, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle conditions
were also qualitatively assessed.

Introduction


1.3.11.              Vehicle Miles Traveled Analysis
The average trip lengths by category were obtained from the Alameda CTC travel demand model for
the Project’s traffic analysis zone (TAZ) 78. This average trip length was then multiplied by the vehicle
trip generation estimates to estimate daily, AM peak, PM peak, and Saturday midday vehicle miles
traveled (VMT). The VMT attributable to the proposed Project is included for informational purposes.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter provides a description of the existing roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bikeway networks
and documentation of the existing traffic, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, parking and loading, and
emergency vehicle access conditions in the study area. The summary utilizes new data including traffic
counts and field observations conducted in February 2016 and information included in the City of
Berkeley General Plan Land Use and Transportation Elements, 1900 Fourth Street Preliminary
Transportation Assessment (Fehr and Peers, June 2015), and the WBCMP Existing Conditions Report
(Wilbur Smith Associates, May 2009).


2.1. ROADWAY NETWORK
The proposed Project is located within West Berkeley. West Berkeley includes several key regional and
local travel corridors that connect with Interstate 80/Interstate 580 (I-80/I-580) and cities situated
along the parallel San Pablo Avenue (State Route 123) corridor. Roadway facilities within the study area
are summarized in this section.

Interstate 80/Interstate 580 is a ten-lane, north-south freeway facility with a High Occupancy Vehicle
(HOV) lane in each direction. I-80/I-580 is located on the western edge of Berkeley. The freeway has a
dual designation (I-80 and I-580) through Berkeley and splits just to the north and south of Berkeley city
limits. The freeway connects Berkeley to southern Alameda County to the south, San Francisco and the
Peninsula to the west, the Sacramento region to the east, and Marin County to the north. The
Eastshore Highway and two interchanges (Gilman Street and University Avenue) provide access to the
freeway near the Project site.
Eastshore Highway is a two-lane, two-way, north-south collector road that runs parallel to I-80/I-580.
This roadway serves as an access road to several residential and collector streets. Direct access to
Eastshore Highway is provided at the intersection with Hearst Avenue about two blocks west of the
site.
San Pablo Avenue (SR 123) is a north-south divided arterial with two lanes in each direction and
dedicated turn lanes at major intersections. San Pablo Avenue is a Caltrans’ State Route and the only
north-south designated truck route (serving seven-ton trucks) in the study area. San Pablo Avenue is
sometimes used as an alternate route to the Eastshore Freeway when that freeway becomes
congested. On-street parking is provided on both sides of San Pablo Avenue. The speed limit is 30 miles
per hour.
University Avenue is an east-west divided arterial with two lanes in each direction and dedicated turn
lanes at major intersections that connect downtown Berkeley with I-80/I-580 and the Berkeley Marina.
South of the proposed Project, west of Sixth Street, University Avenue is an elevated structure over the
I-80/I-580 freeway and Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) tracks. Two one-way frontage roads, one on each
side of the overpass, extend to a turnaround east of the UPRR tracks at Third Street. Metered parking is
provided on both sides of University Avenue near the proposed Project site. The speed limit is 25 miles
per hour.

Existing Conditions


Sixth Street is a north-south roadway with two lanes in each direction in the vicinity of the Project site.
Farther from the site, Sixth Street generally has one lane in each direction with dedicated left turn lanes
at major intersections. On-street parking is provided on both sides of Sixth Street near the proposed
Project site. The speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

Fourth Street is a north-south roadway with one lane in each direction in the vicinity of the Project site.
Fourth Street runs from Gilman Street to the north to Dwight Way to the south and serves the Fourth
Street commercial corridor between Virginia Street and Hearst Avenue. On-street parking is provided
on both sides of Sixth Street near the proposed Project site. The speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

Hearst Avenue is an east-west roadway with one lane in each direction in the vicinity of the Project site.
Hearst Avenue runs from Eastshore Highway to the east and along the north side of UC Berkeley
campus to the west. On-street parking is provided on both sides of Hearst Avenue near the proposed
Project site. The speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

Addison Street is an east-west roadway with one lane in each direction in the vicinity of the Project
site. Addison Street runs from Second Street to the west, crosses the UPRR tracks, and continues across
San Pablo Avenue to dead end at Curtis Street. On-street parking is provided on both sides of Addison
Street near the proposed Project site. The speed limit is 25 miles per hour.


2.1.1. Truck Routes
Truck routes are signed by the City of Berkeley as defined in Berkeley Municipal Code Section 14.56.060,
requiring drivers of heavy-duty commercial vehicles weighing seven or more tons to use the designated
route system. The designated routes within the study area are University Avenue and San Pablo
Avenue. All streets south of Cedar Street and north of University Avenue, between San Pablo Avenue
and Sixth Street have three–ton truck prohibitions.


2.1.2. Emergency Vehicle Routes
Emergency vehicle routes within the City of Berkeley’s evacuation network that are located within the
study area include San Pablo Avenue, Sixth Street, Cedar Street, and University Avenue. Due to the
presence of traffic calming features in West Berkeley, routing for emergency vehicles is not always
direct. Although emergency vehicles can maneuver through the traffic calmed areas, speeds are
reduced such that emergency vehicle drivers choose less direct routes for faster operations.

2.1.3. Traffic Calming
Several streets within the vicinity of the proposed Project feature traffic calming elements Traffic
calming features within the study area are described in this section.4

               Diverters (Semi and full diverters). Diverters include semi-diverters, which close half the
                street, and full diverters, which create a cul-de sac-or are placed diagonally across an
                intersection and force vehicles to turn the corner. Most full diverters have a gap between
                the bollards and can allow passage of fire trucks and other high-clearance vehicles. Nearly
                all diverters allow bicycles to pass through on the street.
               Traffic Circles. Traffic circles sit in the center of an intersection and are designed to force
                vehicles to slow down and turn right around them in order to proceed.
               Speed Humps. Speed humps are rounded raised areas of pavement often placed in a series
                and used on residential streets to slow vehicles.
               Curb Extensions (Bulb-outs). Curb extensions visually and physically narrow the roadway,
                increasing the overall visibility of pedestrians and creating shorter crossing distances.


2.2. INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
Traffic counts for all study intersections were collected during the weekday AM and PM peak periods
on Tuesday, February 2, 2016 and Saturday February 6, 2016. Parking observations were conducted
during the evening peak period on Tuesday, February 2, 2016. Additional site observations were
conducted during the weekday peak periods on Thursday, February 25, 2016 and during the Saturday
midday peak period on Saturday, February 27, 2016.5

Current lane geometries and Existing Conditions traffic volumes are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 and
Existing Conditions intersection LOS is summarized in Table 4 for the weekday AM and PM and Saturday
midday peak hours. Traffic count data is included in Appendix D and intersection operations analysis
worksheets for the study intersection are included in Appendix E.

As shown in Table 4, the San Pablo Avenue / University Avenue and Sixth Street / University Avenue
intersections currently operate at LOS D during the weekday AM and PM peak hours and the Saturday
midday peak hour under Existing Conditions. All other study intersections currently operate at LOS B or
better during all peak hours. Existing intersection operations were confirmed through field observations
of intersection operations during both the weekday AM and PM and Saturday midday peak hours.
General adjustments (heavy vehicles, conflicting bicycles and pedestrian movements, parking
maneuvers, bus stops, signal timing, etc.) to HCM inputs were made in accordance with observations.

    2.2.1. Signal Warrant Analysis
Based on the results of the intersection LOS analysis included in Table 4, the unsignalized intersections
currently operate at LOS B or better during all peak hours. As such, signal warrant analyses are not
required at these locations under Existing Conditions.


2.3. TRANSIT NETWORK
Local, Rapid, and Transbay fixed-route bus and shuttle service is provided by Alameda-Contra Costa
County Transit (AC Transit). Regional commuter rail service is provided by Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART), and passenger rail service along the UPRR corridor is provided by Amtrak. Other regional transit
service is accessible by transferring to and from AC Transit. Figure 6 illustrates the transit service near
the site.

Existing Conditions


Observations of transit service and ridership indicate that transit activity is primarily concentrated along
the San Pablo Avenue and University Avenue corridors during the weekday AM and PM peak hours with
lower levels of transit activity occurring during the Saturday midday peak hour. The University Avenue
North Frontage Road is currently striped with red curb along the Project site and is utilized as a bus
layover zone for AC Transit Line 51B. This layover zone was observed to be well utilized throughout the
day by AC Transit vehicles.

The majority of AC Transit routes in West Berkeley operate 40-foot buses during peak periods. Route 72
and 72M often use a 60-foot articulated bus. AC Transit bus operating speeds and schedule adherence
are adversely impacted by traffic congestion. During field observations, buses on Sixth Street at Hearst
Avenue were observed to have some difficulty re-entering the southbound traffic due to the heavy
traffic flows during the weekday AM peak period. Most of the bus stops in West Berkeley have been
moved to far-side locations at intersection to improve bus operating efficiencies and safety.


2.3.2. Bay Area Rapid Transit
BART is the regional rapid transit provider and connects Berkeley to other parts of Alameda County,
Contra Costa County, San Francisco, and northern San Mateo County. The BART system operates trains
along five routes: (1) Richmond-Fremont; (2) Richmond-Daly City/SFO/Millbrae; (3) San Francisco
Airport (SFO)/Millbrae-Dublin / Pleasanton; (4) SFO/Millbrae-Pittsburg / Bay Point; and (5) Fremont-
Daly City. The BART lines that serve the North Berkeley and Downtown Berkeley BART Stations, nearest
the Project site, include the Richmond-Fremont, and Richmond-Daly City/SFO/Millbrae lines.

The nearest BART station to the project site is the North Berkeley BART Station at Virginia Street /
Sacramento Street, located approximately 1.2 miles (about a 20 minute walk) from the proposed
Project site. AC Transit Local Line 51B provides weekday daily and weekend service along University
Avenue to serve this station. The nearest stop to the Project site is located at the Amtrak station on
University Avenue at Third Street. The nearest stop to the North Berkeley BART Station is located about
a 13 minute bus ride away at University and Acton Street, about 0.4 miles (or about a 7 minute walk)
south of the station. The Downtown Berkeley BART Station is located about 1.9 miles east of the
proposed Project at Shattuck Avenue / Center Street. AC Transit Local Line 51B provides direct weekday
daily and weekend service to this station with average travel times of less than 20 minutes.6


2.3.3. Amtrak Capitol Corridor and Union Pacific Railroad
Amtrak’s Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin services provides intercity rail service to the Berkeley Amtrak
station located at University Avenue and Third Street, below the University Avenue overpass, adjacent
to the Project site. Capitol Corridor service connects Berkeley to San Jose, Oakland, Davis, and
Sacramento, and smaller communities along the route. In total, passenger operations contribute to 44

daily trains running through the station, with four to five trains per hour in both the weekday AM and
PM peak hours.

The UPRR mainline tracks through West Berkeley provide a key link for freight and passenger activity in
the Bay Area. Opportunities to increase operations along this corridor could result in an increase in the
number and length of trains per day through West Berkeley. This increase in rail activity could result in
increase in delay to local circulation, and increased exposure for vehicles, transit, pedestrians and
bicycles, where at-grade crossings exist (at Hearst Avenue and Addison Street, between Second Street
and Fourth Street in the vicinity of the Project).

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has identified the Hearst Street railroad crossing (DOT
#751179D), located on the northwest corner of the Project site, as a crossing of concern. The Hearst
Street railroad crossing is currently equipped with Flashing Lights and Gates Assembly (Commission
Standard No 9s) and does not meet current ADA standards.


2.4. PEDESTRIAN CONDITIONS

2.4.1. Pedestrian Facilities
The Project site fronts Fourth Street, a Major Commercial District between Cedar Street and University
Avenue and Pedestrian Plan Area of Countywide Significance in the Alameda Countywide Pedestrian
Plan. Sidewalks ranging from five to eight feet in width are provided on both sides of all streets adjacent
to the Project site. Sidewalks are not provided on either side of Second Street between Addison Street
and Hearst Avenue. The presence of parking meters, trash bins and other obstructions reduce the
effective sidewalk width to less than three feet at some locations. Sidewalks on the south side of Hearst
Avenue between Second Street and Fourth Street are particularly constrained. Additionally, large curb
radii and the absence of curb ramps at some locations (e.g., Second Street / Hearst Avenue) limit
accessibility, result in long pedestrian crossing distances, and generally reduce the quality of the
pedestrian environment.

Marked crosswalks and other pedestrian infrastructure (curb ramps, pedestrian push buttons and
countdown signals), are provided at all signalized study intersections. A high-visibility mid-block
crossing with advance yield markings is located on Fourth Street between University Avenue and Hearst
Avenue. Marked crosswalks are provided at all legs of unsignalized intersections with the exception of
the south and east legs of the Second Street / Hearst Avenue intersection. Potential for vehicular-
pedestrian conflicts was observed at unsignalized intersections where drivers were observed not to
yield to pedestrians waiting to cross. The railroad at-grade crossing also presents a safety concern. As
described in Section 2.4.3, the crossing does not meet current ADA standards.

2.4.2. Pedestrian Activity
Generally moderate to high levels of pedestrian activity were observed on blocks adjacent the Project
site with activity concentrated along Fourth Street, at intersections immediately adjacent to the Project
site (i.e., Fourth Street / Hearst Avenue and Fourth Street / University) as well as along University
Avenue near the Berkeley Amtrak Station.

During the Saturday midday peak hour, more than 850 pedestrians were observed crossing the Fourth
Street / Hearst Avenue intersection, about 500 pedestrians were observed crossing at San Pablo
Avenue / University Avenue and about 250 pedestrians were observed at the Fourth Street / University
Avenue North Frontage intersection. During the weekday AM and PM peak periods, pedestrian activity
was concentrated along University Avenue and about 450 pedestrians were observed at the San Pablo
Avenue / University Avenue intersection. About 200 pedestrians were observed at Fourth Street /
Hearst Avenue during the weekday PM peak hour and about 100 pedestrians were observed at Fourth
Street / University Avenue North Frontage. Pedestrians are distributed fairly evenly on both sides of the
street with the majority traveling north-south along Fourth Street.

Periods of peak pedestrian activity coincided with the peak commute periods and short peaks of
pedestrian activity occurred during Amtrak train arrivals. Pedestrian activity was generally higher during
the weekend as people visited restaurants and shops along Fourth Street. Day laborers were observed
in groups waiting on sidewalks and street corners throughout the study area, including Second Street,
Fifth Street, and Hearst Avenue. Recreational users (e.g., runners and dog walkers) were observed to be
concentrated on Sixth Street, Hearst Avenue, Addison Street and the I-80 Bicycle and Pedestrian
Overcrossing. Pedestrian counts are included in Appendix D.


2.5. BICYCLE CONDITIONS

2.5.1. Bicycle Facility Classifications
City of Berkeley bicycle facilities are classified with the following designations:

Class 1 Multi-Use Path (paved and unpaved) – Also known as a bicycle path, this is a dedicated path for
bicyclists and pedestrians that does not permit motorized travel. Bicycle paths create a relaxed
environment for non-motorized travel and reduce the risk of potential conflict between vehicles and
bicyclists. These facilities are typically located in parks or greenway areas, areas connecting dead-end
streets, or atop railroad right-of-way that is no longer in use.

Class 2 Bicycle Lane – Also known as a bicycle lane, this is a portion of the roadway network that has
been striped and signed for bicycle use. Bicycle lanes are typically used along collector or major streets
with medium to high traffic volumes, providing additional travel space for bicyclists along busy roadway
segments.

Class 3 Bicycle Route –This is a bikeway that primarily serves to connect other facilities and destinations
in the bikeway network but provides a lower level of service than Class 1 or Class 2 bikeway facilities.
These routes include signage but do not have roadway markings or striping to indicate reserved space
for the bicyclist.

               Class 3A Bicycle Route – These facilities are found along some arterial streets where bicycle
                lanes are not feasible and parallel streets do not provide adequate connectivity. Speed
                limits as low as 25 mph, shared lane bicycle stencils, wide curb lanes, and signage are used
                to encourage shared use.
               Class 3B Bicycle Boulevard – These facilities are found along residential streets with low
                traffic volumes. In addition to signage, traffic calming measures and bicycle traffic signal
                actuation are used to prioritize through-trips for bicycles.


2.5.2. Existing Bicycle Facilities
Existing bicycle facilities and traffic calming features in the study area are described in this section and
illustrated in Figure 7

Ohlone Greenway is a Class 1 pedestrian and bicycle path that begins at the east end of Ohlone Park at
Martin Luther King Jr Way / Hearst Avenue and runs west to Sacramento Street and Delaware Street. In
the segment around the North Berkeley BART Station (one block west on Delaware Street to Acton
Street, then one block north on Acton Street to Virginia Street), the bike path becomes a Class 2 on-
street bike lane. At Virginia Street, the path resumes its own dedicated course northwest of the North
Berkeley BART station and runs through the cities of Albany and El Cerrito, terminating at San Pablo
Avenue at Baxter Creek Gateway Park in Richmond. For most of its length, the Ohlone Greenway runs
along what was formerly a railroad right-of-way, and alongside the elevated tracks of the BART
Richmond line. For the majority of this segment, the Ohlone Greenway is divided into two paths, one
for bicyclists and one for pedestrians.

West Street Pathway is a Class 1 pedestrian and bicycle path that follows a route along the former
Southern Pacific Railway right of way between Cedar Rose Park and Strawberry Canyon Park. The trail
intersects with the Ohlone Greenway south of Cedar Street, continues south across University Avenue
at a signalized trail intersection and then continues as an on-street bike path and sidewalk at Addison
Street. From the Ohlone Greenway to University Avenue, the West Street Pathway is 14 feet wide with
striping to separate pedestrians and bicyclists. The section between University Avenue and Addison
Street runs along a 10-foot wide easement and does not have striping to separate pedestrians and
bicyclists.

Fourth Street/Fifth Street is a north-south Class 3A facility that extends along Fifth Street from Gilman
Street to Hearst Avenue, continues east-west along Hearst Avenue to Fourth Street and continues
south to Channing Way. Hearst Avenue is an east-west Class 3A facility for one block that connects the
north-south Fourth Street/Fifth Street route. Fourth Street is identified as an “unclassified” route from
Virginia Street to Channing Way in the Alameda Countywide Bicycle Plan.

Channing Way is an east-west Class 3B facility between Fourth Street and MLK Jr Way and a Class 2
facility to Piedmont Avenue in the east. This traffic-calmed bicycle boulevard provides a major east-
west connect connection between Aquatic Park, downtown Berkeley and UC Berkeley.

Virginia Street is an east-west Class 3B facility that begins at Euclid Street in the east, three blocks north
of the entrance to UC Berkeley, and continues to 5th Street in the west. This boulevard provides a
connection to the University Avenue Pedestrian Bridge and the Berkeley Marina Overpass via Fifth
Street, Hearst Avenue, Fourth Street, Addison Street, and Aquatic Park.

Delaware Street is an east-west Class 2 bicycle facility that runs from Sacramento Street / Ohlone
Greenway in the east to Ninth Street in the west and connects the Ninth Street bicycle boulevard with
the Ohlone Greenway Class 1 bicycle and pedestrian path.

Ninth Street is a north-south Class 3B facility that runs from Albany to Emeryville through West
Berkeley. At the north end it begins on Eighth Street at the entrance to UC Village, runs three blocks on
Eighth Street to the Camelia Street Connector, and continues on Ninth Street. The bicycle boulevard
continues on Ninth Street to Heinz Avenue, near the southern city limit. A bike path connection is
planned to connect the Ninth Street Bicycle Boulevard with bicycle facilities in Emeryville.


2.5.3. Bicycle Activity
Generally low to moderate levels of bicycle activity were observed on streets in the vicinity of the
Project site with activity concentrated on designated bike routes, such as Fourth Street. Minimal bicycle
activity was observed along Hearst Avenue, west of the railroad crossing. During the weekday AM peak
hour, a majority of the bicyclists were destined for the Amtrak station. The highest level of bicycle
activity occurred during the weekday PM and Saturday midday peak hours along Fourth Street. About
40 bicycles utilized Fourth Street to cross University Avenue with an even split of about 20 bicycles
traveling northbound and 20 traveling southbound. The Sixth Street / Hearst Avenue intersection was
the next most active location with 30 bicyclists crossing at this location. Bicycle counts are included in
Appendix D.


2.6. PARKING CONDITIONS
Existing parking conditions were examined for all on-street and off-street publicly-accessible parking
facilities within a two-block radius of the Project site (bounded by Virginia Street to the north, Allston
Way to the south, Second Street to the west, and Sixth Street to the east), which represents the typical
distance that most people would be willing to park and walk to their destination. Parking occupancy
counts were collected in the study area on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday (September 12 to 14, 2014)
from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM and on Tuesday evening (February 3, 2016) from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, which
represent the typical peak period of parking demand for commercial and residential uses. A summary of
weekday midday, weekday evening and weekend (Saturday) midday peak period on-street parking
occupancy is provided in this section and illustrated in Appendix G.

Existing Conditions


The Project site is located adjacent to the Fourth Street commercial corridor. There are several other
private parking facilities (surface parking lots), mostly serving employees and business customers, but
no city-owned or public off-street parking facilities within the parking study area. There are about 900
parking spaces in surface lots throughout the study area, which increases to about 1,180 spaces during
evenings and weekends, when private employee lots become available for public use. These surface
parking lots provide a combination of unrestricted or reserved parking and are generally free, with the
exception of the 350 space surface parking lot on the proposed Project site. On-street parking consists
of about 200 metered spaces located primarily along streets with commercial frontages (e.g., Hearst
Avenue and Fourth Street) and about 250 unmetered parking spaces without time restrictions along
other streets.

For both Thursday and Friday midday peak periods, combined demand for on-street and off-street
parking utilization peaked at 1:00 PM with an occupancy rate of 78% on Thursday and 73% on Friday.
For Tuesday evening peak period, on-street parking utilization peaked with a total occupancy of 42%.
During the Tuesday evening peak, about 264 on-street parking spaces were available. Peak parking
occupancy on Saturday occurred at 2:00 PM with a total occupancy of about 84%. During the Saturday
peak, about 50 on-street spaces and 175 off-street spaces were available. Generally, the available on-
street spaces were located south of University Avenue.

The 1900 Fourth Street Parking Lot is the only public paid lot in the area and typically has lower parking
occupancies than on-street parking and other free lots in the vicinity. Based on observations conducted
during the weekday AM peak period (between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM), the lot was observed to be
mostly vacant and vehicles parked in the lot are likely those with monthly parking permits, specifically,
mobile food vendors and delivery vehicles.7 The peak parking occupancy at the 1900 Fourth Street
Parking Lot occurred on Saturday afternoon when the occupancy was about 65% (corresponding to
about 230 occupied spaces and 120 available spaces). The lot was about 50% occupied during the
Thursday peak and about 40% occupied during the Friday peak (corresponding to about 175 and 130
occupied spaces, respectively). About 50 or 60 of these parking spaces were occupied by customers of
the Spenger’s Restaurant.

Based on these observations, on- and off-street parking is fairly well-utilized on specific blocks within
the study area. However, parking spaces were observed to be generally available throughout the day
and overnight, within a two-block radius of the Project site.


2.7. LOADING CONDITIONS
The nearest on-street commercial loading (yellow curb) space is located on the north side of University
between Fourth Street and Fifth Street. One on-street passenger loading (white curb) spaces is located
on the south side of Hearst Avenue, immediately east of the existing curb cut serving the Project site.

    Delivery vehicles observed in the parking lot included three vehicles from the SpoonRocket fleet. SpoonRocket is an food delivery service providing
      on-demand delivery service to the East Bay and San Francisco.

                                                                             30                                             Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

Existing Conditions


There is also a white curb zone on the east side of Fourth Street immediately south of the existing mid-
block crosswalk.

While freight/truck activity was relatively high in the area, minimal delivery/loading activity was
observed in the vicinity of the Project site. Where loading spaces were not provided, on-street parking
spaces were generally available for use by delivery vehicles. Double parking was not observed and
loading operations did not cause congestion or adversely affect traffic, transit, bicycles, or pedestrians.


2.8. EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS
Emergency vehicle access to the proposed Project would be provided from Hearst Avenue, Fourth
Street, and University Avenue North Frontage. The nearest fire station (Berkeley Fire Station #6) is
located at 699 Cedar Street, between Eighth Street and Ninth Street, about 0.7 mile northeast of the
Project site. The next-nearest fire station (Berkeley Fire Station #1) is located at 2442 8th Street, about
0.8 mile south of the Project site. During peak commute times, general traffic congestion throughout
the Project study area may result in some delay to emergency vehicle response. However, due to the
proximity to two fire stations, response times would be expected to be less than five minutes.

3. EXISTING PLUS APPROVED CONDITIONS
This chapter summarizes Existing plus Approved Conditions. The scenario takes into consideration the
following approved and pending land use development:

               800 University Avenue
               824 University Avenue
               2013 Second Street
               2001 Fourth Street
               1500 San Pablo Avenue
The majority of the approved development is occurring to the south of the proposed Project, with the
exception of the 1500 San Pablo Avenue site, located to the northeast. The list of approved projects, is
included in Appendix H.


3.1. INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
The City provided project descriptions and weekday AM and PM peak hour vehicle-trip generation
estimates for the list of approved projects. Vehicle trips generated by these land uses were added to
Existing Conditions traffic volumes to derive Existing plus Approved Conditions traffic volumes. Existing
plus Approved Conditions traffic volumes are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 Existing plus Approved
Conditions intersection LOS is summarized in Table 6.

As shown in Table 6, with the addition of traffic generated by the approved and reasonably foreseeable
projects, study intersections would continue to operate at the same levels of service as under Existing
Conditions.


3.1.1. Signal Warrant Analysis
Based on the results of the intersection LOS analysis included in Table 6, the unsignalized intersections
currently operate at LOS B or better. As such, signal warrant analyses are not required.

4. CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS
This chapter summarizes Cumulative Conditions. The future year (year 2040) traffic analysis takes into
consideration forecasted land use development and planned, funded, and approved changes to the
transportation (roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle) network and infrastructure near the proposed
Project site.

Traffic forecasts were developed using directional link-based growth rates for the weekday AM and PM
peak periods derived from the Alameda CTC travel demand model. Weekday AM and PM growth rates
were averaged to estimate Saturday midday peak hour growth rates. The Alameda CTC travel demand
model roadway network is based on the constrained project list included in the Regional Transportation
Plan, Plan Bay Area. Projects on this list include:

                I-80 / Ashby Avenue Interchange Improvements
                I-80 Express Lanes (Carquinez Bridge to Powell Street)
                I-80 Integrated Corridor Management
Model plots and growth rate calculations are provided in Appendix I.


4.1. TRANSPORTATION NETWORK IMPROVEMENTS
Planned roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle network and infrastructure improvements in the
vicinity of the Project site are summarized in this section.


4.1.1. Roadway Network
Though not included on the Plan Bay Area list, according to the schedule posted on the City’s website,
the I-80/Gilman Street Interchange Project is currently undergoing environmental review (Project
Approval and Environmental Documentation [PA/ED]) with construction slated to begin in 2019.8,9 The
I-80 / Gilman Street Interchange Project proposes to improve vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle
operations at the I-80 / Gilman Street interchange in northwest Berkeley. Among several stated project
goals, the proposed project seeks to simplify and improve navigation and traffic operations on Gilman
Street through the I-80 interchange and improve access for bikes/pedestrians traveling between the
Bay Trail and northern Berkeley. Project components include the reconfiguration of I-80 ramps and
ramp intersections, and reconstruction of Gilman Street from north of West Frontage Road to south of
Second Street. Currently three build alternatives are being evaluated.

4.1.2. Transit Network
AC Transit service expansion and improvements within the Albany/Berkeley/Emeryville geographic sub-
area consist of increasing frequency, establishing a network of crosstown routes, reconfiguring loop
routes in Berkeley to straight routes, simplifying the route structure, and matching service with existing
commercial and residential markets and future development growth in West Berkeley. Specific changes
affecting service within the study area are outlined below. A complete summary of improvements is
provided in the AC Transit’s 2015 Service Expansion Plan (October 2015).10

                  Line 51B. Create new Line 51B College-University and improve reliability and legibility of the
                   route by removing alternating Line 51B service to the Berkeley Marina. . Service to Berkeley
                   Marina would be replaced by Line L21 Ashby.
                  Line 52. Create new Line 52 Cedar-University. Increase frequency from 15 to 30 minutes to
                   every 15 minutes in the peak period and from 30 minutes to every 20 minutes in the off-
                   peak.
                  Line 72/72M. Create new Line M4 San Pablo/MacDonald. Consolidate line 72 and 72M into
                   a single route (Line M4) offering 15-minute service on San Pablo Avenue and MacDonald.
                  Line 72R. Create new Line R1 San Pablo Rapid. Increase frequency from 12 minutes to every
                   10 minutes in the peak period and extend service by five hours from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM.
                  Line J. Create new Line J Sacramento and reroute to continue straight down Sacramento
                   Street and Market Street.
Implementation of these transit network enhancements would increase transit ridership and increase
potential for higher transit mode share for residents and visitors of the proposed Project.


4.1.3. Pedestrian and Bicycle Network
The Berkeley Pedestrian Master Plan establishes specific goals and recommendations to ensure that
walking in Berkeley is safe, attractive, easy, and convenient for people of all ages and abilities. The
Pedestrian Master Plan identified the top 100 intersections in need of infrastructure improvements and
grouped improvements into 34 projects prioritized based on safety, usage levels, and access to major
destinations. The City is currently working to implement these high priority projects and recently
submitted Active Transportation Program grant applications for: enhancements along Sacramento
Street at Virginia Street, University Avenue and Addison Street; bulb-outs and signal retiming at San
Pablo Avenue and Delaware Street and San Pablo Avenue and Cedar Street; and, bulb-outs and flashing
pedestrian beacons at University Avenue and Grant Street.11

Cumulative Conditions


Berkeley is currently in the process of updating its bicycle plan. The current Berkeley Bicycle Master
Plan was adopted in 2000 and updated in 2005. There are no bicycle improvements planned within the
study area.


4.2. INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
Cumulative traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 10 and Figure 11 and the resulting intersection LOS
is summarized in Table 7. As shown by bold text in Table 7, five of the seven study intersections would
deteriorate from acceptable LOS D or better to LOS F during at least one peak hour under Cumulative
Conditions.

Signal Warrant Analysis
The CA-MUTCD Warrant 3 Peak Hour Vehicular Delay and Volume Warrant was evaluated at study
unsignalized intersections which are projected to operate at unacceptable LOS (i.e., LOS E or LOS F)
under Cumulative Conditions: Second Street / Hearst Avenue and Fourth Street / Hearst Avenue. The
CA-MUTCD Peak Hour Vehicular Delay and Volume Warrant criteria is not met during the weekday peak
hours. Peak hour signal warrant calculation worksheets are included in Appendix J.


4.3. CMP AND MTS ROADWAY SEGMENT ANALYSIS
Congestion Management Program Land Use Analysis was performed to identify any potential impacts
of the proposed Project on the MTS roadway network. The potential impacts of the proposed Project to
transit operators, bicyclists and pedestrians are discussed in separate sections. Vehicle impacts were
assessed at selected roadway locations, including two segments of I-80/I-580, San Pablo Avenue,
University Avenue, and Sixth Street. Traffic forecasts for Year 2040 conditions were extracted from the
current version of the Countywide Model (dated December 2015) at the selected roadway segments.
Cumulative Conditions MTS study roadway segment LOS is summarized in Table 8 for the weekday AM
and PM peak hours. Roadway segment operations analysis worksheets are included in Appendix F.

As shown in Table 8, six MTS study roadway segments would operate over capacity at LOS F with a v/c
ratio of greater than 1.0 under Cumulative Conditions during either the weekday AM and/or weekday
PM peak hour. All other CMP and MTS study roadway segments would continue to operate at LOS E or
better during the weekday AM and PM peak hours under Cumulative Conditions.

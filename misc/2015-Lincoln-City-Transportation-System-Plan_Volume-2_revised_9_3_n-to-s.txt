            Alternative Mobility Targets                                                             P11086-010


It is important for a Transportation System Plan (TSP) to identify a full range of transportation system projects
and services that would address the deficiencies that would exist at the end of a 20-year planning horizon if the
community grows in accordance with its existing adopted land use plan and no additional improvements are
made during that period of time.

However, it is also important for a TSP to realistically identify which transportation projects and services are
reasonably likely to be implemented over the 20-year planning horizon, based on financial or other constraints.
This exercise enables the community and, as appropriate, the state to establish realistic expectations for how
that transportation system will likely operate at the end of the 20-year planning horizon.

Because of the financial and other constraints that have been faced by state and local governments over the last
20 years and which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future, it is often the case that the local
and/or state roadways will not be improved to the extent that they will be able meet local level-of-service (LOS)
standards or, in the case of ODOT, roadway volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio based mobility targets, at the end of
the 20-year planning horizon if the community grows in accordance with its existing, adopted land use plan.
This is particularly common in larger communities or in those with roadways that experience higher travel
demands. In these cases, it is appropriate to adjust roadway performance expectations, as expressed through
local LOS standards or state mobility targets, to match the performance that is actually forecasted to exist at the
end of the 20-year planning horizon, through the adoption of alternative standards or mobility targets.

In other words, in these situations, adopting alternative standards or mobility targets is simply an exercise in
adjusting roadway performance expectations to match realistic expectations for how the roadways are actually
forecasted to operate, taking into account financial and other constraints and assuming implementation of the
existing, adopted local land use plan. In addition to establishing realistic expectations for future system
performance, this process will help reduce the potential for state and local investment needs by not continuing
to require compliance with standards or targets that both parties acknowledge cannot likely be achieved,
assuming that the community continues to grow in accordance with its existing, adopted land use plan.
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets
August 22, 2014
Page 2 of 12

In Lincoln City, the transportation system analysis has revealed that portions of US 101 are not expected to be
able to meet ODOT’s existing adopted mobility targets at the end of the 20-year planning horizon, based on the
transportation impact associated with the population and employment growth expected through
implementation of the City’s existing, adopted land use plan and the transportation system performance that
would result, assuming implementation of only those projects and services that have been identified as
reasonably likely to be funded during the 20-year planning horizon. This memorandum documents the need for
developing alternative mobility targets for US 101 through Lincoln City and describes the proposed new targets.
Included is a summary of the methodology and results, and the recommended alternative mobility targets for
the highway.

Background
The segment of US 101 under
consideration, shown in Figure
1, is bounded by the urban
growth boundary (near Clancy
Road to the north and near SW
63rd Street to the south). US 101
is the major transportation
route through Lincoln City,
running north to south bisecting
the city. The Pacific Ocean, Siletz
Bay, Devils Lake, D River, and
hilly topography- limit
continuous north to south
routes parallel to US 101. At
several locations, US 101 is the
only north-south street, forcing
most drivers to use it for trips
within the city.

Within Lincoln City, US 101 is
classified as a Statewide
Highway. Statewide Highways
typically provide inter-urban
and inter-regional mobility and
provide connections to larger
urban areas, ports, and major        Figure 1: US 101 Segment Under Consideration for Alternative Mobility Targets
recreation areas that are not
directly served by Interstate Highways. A secondary function is to provide connections for intra-urban and intra-
regional trips. The management objective is to provide safe and efficient, high-speed, continuous-flow
operation. In addition, US 101 through Lincoln City is part of the National Highway System and Strategic
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets

National Defense Highway Network (STRAHNET), and is a designated Federal truck route, Scenic Byway, and a
Tier 1 Lifeline Route.

A portion of US 101 within the Taft district (475 feet north of SW Fleet Avenue to 250 feet south of SW/SE 51st
Street) also has a Special Transportation Area (STA) designation. The primary objective of a STA is to provide
access to and circulation amongst community activities, businesses, and residences and to accommodate
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit movement along and across the highway. Although motor vehicle traffic moves
through an STA and automobiles may play an important role in accessing an STA, convenience of movement
within an STA focuses upon pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes. It encourages direct street connections and
shared on-street parking. Local auto, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit movements to the area are generally as
important as the through movement of traffic. Because of this, ODOT’s mobility targets and design standards in
STA’s are intended to allow for lower speed operations.

The Need for Alternative Mobility Targets
Prior to exploring alternatives to the current mobility targets, evaluation of the disparity between the current
targets and forecasted traffic operations confirmed the need for assessing the potential to mitigate conditions
through other means. The findings of that evaluation are described below.

Existing and Future Highway Operations
A comparison of existing (year 2012) and future (year 2035) traffic operations along US 101 to adopted mobility
targets during summer traffic conditions (30 HV) shows that most intersections operate well today, but traffic
demand in the summer p.m. peak period at many intersections will exceed capacity by 2035. Table 2
summarizes the results of this analysis, along with both the Highway Design Manual (HDM) and existing OHP
Mobility Targets. Typically, the Highway Design Manual mobility standard is applied to the evaluation of highway
construction improvements and the existing OHP Mobility Targets are used in the assessment of development
proposals and planning projects. As shown, most of the intersections would fail to comply with both standards
by 2035.

The Transportation System Plan (TSP) development process considered a range of improvement options for US
101. This included widening the highway corridor to add capacity, making spot improvements at intersections,
enhancing the transit system, expanding the cycling and walking networks, strategies to help manage peak
travel demands, and improvements to maximize the efficiency of the existing street network. Widening the
highway to five lanes through the city would add a significant amount of capacity and would allow nearly all
intersections to comply with current mobility targets. However, the impact to existing development would be
significant considering the surrounding environment and constrained right-of-way (both built environment and
physical constraints). Additionally, the cost of such widening (in total or for any segment that currently does not
have five lanes) is well beyond any reasonably likely expectation for funding during the 20-year based on current
ODOT funding capabilities. Therefore, the highway-widening improvements were not recommended for
implementation within the 20-year planning horizon.

Widening US 101 to a uniform five-lane cross-section will be identified as a possibility for the timeframe beyond
the 20-year planning horizon, with the benefits, costs, and constraints duly noted. If strong a community
interest in pursuing highway widening develops and significant (currently unanticipated) funding to implement
widening of one or more highway segments during the current 20-year planning horizon is secured, ODOT will
work with the City to amend the TSP and highway performance expectations accordingly. Absent that
development, ODOT and the City will manage US 101 with the expectation that no highway widening projects
will be developed during the 20-year planning horizon. Without highway widening, the management approach
for US 101 is to maximize the safety and efficiency of the overall transportation system and increase accessibility
and availability of transit, walking and biking facilities, recognizing that it is not currently financially feasible or
practical from either a community impact or physical constraint perspective (or both) to construct additional
highway capacity on US 101 to reduce congestion.

Table 2 shows how US 101 intersections are expected to operate in 2035 during the summer peak with the
recommended improvements from the Lincoln City TSP in place. Congestion on the highway is not expected to
significantly improve over the “No Build” condition, with peak hour demand near or exceeding capacity at most
signalized intersections. Given that highway widening would be required to meet existing OHP Mobility Targets,
it is clear that it will not be possible to meet them along US 101 in Lincoln City by the end of the 20-year
planning horizon.

Factors Limiting the Ability to Meet Existing Mobility Targets
Several factors combine to make compliance with the current mobility targets along US 101 difficult. They
include:

       Competition from Multiple Users
        The importance of US 101 to statewide, regional, and local traffic creates significant demands for both
        short and long trips along the corridor. These competing users include:

           Motorists making local trips to homes, work, and shopping
           Motorists making regional trips through Lincoln City between other cities along the coast
           Freight traveling to and through Lincoln City (US 101 is a Federal Truck Route)
           Tourists driving along the coast, many with large recreational vehicles, and stopping in Lincoln City
            to shop, dine, and enjoy the attractions
           Transit, including movement and access – most of the local transit routes are along US 101
           Bicyclists- US 101 is a major touring bike route as well as a means of transportation for locals
           Pedestrians using the most direct route, in some places the only route, connecting their residences
            with community facilities, employment, and shopping

       Financial Factors
        As is true for most agencies, funding for City and ODOT transportation improvements is limited. Even if
        all forecasted state and local transportation revenue for projects in Lincoln City over the next 20 years
        were spent on highway capacity improvements, it would still fall well short of enabling current mobility
        targets to be met (and would likely be insufficient to widen even one of the existing non-five lane
        segments).

       Existing Development Patterns
        In many areas along US 101, adjacent development constrains the ability to widen the highway right-of-
        way. Obtaining needed right-of-way for highway widening would require acquisition and removal of
        such development, which would be very expensive and undesirable to the community.

       Environmental Factors
        The Pacific Ocean, Siletz Bay, Devils Lake, D River, and hilly topography (particularly at Spanish Head)
        limits options to provide an effective, connected transportation system, especially along US 101, which
        is the primary transportation corridor through the city. These factors provide a challenging environment
        for transportation and make the construction or expansion of transportation facilities potentially cost
        prohibitive.

Other Strategies Being Applied to Enhance Mobility
Recognizing that mobility along US 101 will be constrained, the City’s Transportation System Plan includes
several actions to help relieve congestion:

       Improvements to local streets to allow the city street network to operate at a Level of Service “E” or
        better through the year 2035. Maintaining good performance of the local streets will help to provide
        attractive travel alternatives to US 101 for local trips, where practical.
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets
August 22, 2014
Page 7 of 12

       Expand the city’s local street network, especially in the north and southeast parts of the city, to improve
        connectivity and create alternate routes to US 101 for local trips, removing them from the highway.

       Use an array of Transportation System Management (TSM) strategies, including adaptive signal timing
        on US 101 (currently being implemented), displaying traveler information at city gateways, improved
        connectivity of local streets, and improved parking management for visitors (in addition to access
        management regulations already in place).

       Enhance the transit system to improve services and provide attractive travel options as funding allows.
        This includes upgrading transit stop accessibility and amenities, working to secure funding to implement
        a seasonal trolley service, expanding LINC service hours, implementing park and ride facilities, and
        coordinating with Lincoln County to improve county-funded transit service.

       Fill facility gaps in the pedestrian and bicycle network and improve crossing opportunities along US 101,
        improving safety and providing access to major activity generators.

However, even with these actions in place, traffic operations along US 101 will not meet existing OHP Mobility
Targets at the end of the 20-year planning horizon. The implementation of these actions, along with the OTC
adoption of alternative mobility targets for US 101 into the OHP that reflect ODOT and the City’s mutual,
realistic highway performance expectations, constitutes ODOT’s US 101 management strategy in Lincoln City
through the 20-year planning horizon.

Proposed Alternative Mobility Targets
The approach to developing alternative mobility targets for US 101 through Lincoln City included the following:

       The replacement of the 30th highest annual hour of traffic analysis time period with the average annual
        weekday peak hour.

       New maximum v/c ratio thresholds that reflect ODOT and City US 101 highway performance
        expectations based on the expected growth associated with implementation of the City’s existing
        adopted land use plan, regional US 101 traffic growth, and state and local transportation facility and
        service improvements that have been identified and reasonably likely to be implemented during the 20-
        year planning horizon with identified funding constraints.

This section describes the proposed alternative mobility targets in detail, including the process used to develop
them and the associated analysis methodology.

Applying the Average Annual Weekday Peak Hour
One characteristic of the current mobility target that makes it difficult to comply with through Lincoln City is the
requirement to use the 30th highest annual hour of traffic as the design period. In many larger urbanized areas,
this time period is roughly equivalent to the average weekday p.m. peak hour at virtually any time during the
year. However, along the Oregon Coast, and in this area in particular, US 101 also serves significant seasonal
demand from recreational trips. Therefore, the 30th highest annual hour of traffic occurs on a summer Friday
evening, when local commuting traffic peaks coincide with recreational traffic peaks. Because it will not be
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets
August 22, 2014
Page 8 of 12

possible to meet, or even stay below actual facility one-hour capacity using ODOT’s standard analysis
methodology during the 30th highest hour, the approach to establish a new mobility target for US 101 through
Lincoln City begins with using a design period that is more representative of travel that does not take place
during the peak summer tourist season.

Figure 2 illustrates the
difference in traffic volumes on
US 101 during an average
weekday compared to the
summer peak (30 HV). During
an average weekday (typically
during late May and early
September), volumes are
generally 20 percent lower
than those along the highway
during the summer. In fact, for
at least eight months out of
the year, traffic volumes are
often well below the annual
average.
                                             Figure 2: Summer volumes on US 101 in Lincoln City are generally 20
                                           percent higher than those along the highway during an average weekday
Since the average annual
weekday p.m. peak hour is more representative of travel on US 101 through Lincoln City for the majority of any
given year than the 30th highest annual hour, this time period is recommended for the analysis methodology
used to develop the US 101 alternative mobility target(s). This would shift the corridor management emphasis
away from accommodating summer recreational trips through the city and refocus it on conditions that are
more representative of every day travel. Furthermore, the 20 percent allowance for additional traffic that could
result from using that time period negates the roughly 30 percent disparity between the current targets and
projected operations in the future.

Assigning New Maximum v/c Ratio Thresholds
As noted above, using the average annual weekday p.m. peak hour as the basis for defining facility performance
instead of the 30th highest annual hour is more consistent with the conditions that exist on US 101 throughout
the majority of any given year. However, even with this methodology adjustment, several intersections still
exceed the OHP v/c ratio values that apply to US 101.

The OHP v/c ratio thresholds for US 101 in Lincoln City range from 0.80 to 0.95. Raising the v/c ratio threshold in
order to match the forecasted roadway performance based on the implementation of the City’s existing,
adopted land use plan and implementation of the identified financially constrained projects along the corridor is
also needed in several areas, in addition to changing the analysis time period as described above.

Alternative Mobility Target Process
Figure 3 shows the ODOT Region 2 methodology for determining
alternative mobility targets. Table 3 summaries the assessment
of each study intersection along US 101 using the methodology.
Refer to Technical Memorandum #8 (Future Transportation
Conditions) for summer and average weekday 2035 p.m. peak
hour motor vehicle volumes used for this methodology.

Step 1: Eight of the twenty-four study intersections (but only
two of the twelve signalized intersections) would be expected to
meet existing OHP mobility targets during the summer of 2035,
after recommended improvements described earlier. To be
compliant, Lincoln City would need alternative mobility targets
for 16 of the twenty-four study intersections.

Step 2: Of the 16 study intersections that would not meet
current mobility targets during the summer of 2035, four (all
signalized) would be expected to operate with v/c ratios less
than 1.0.

Step 3: Of the 12 study intersections expected to operate with a
v/c ratio over 1.0 during the summer of 2035, two would be
expected to operate with v/c ratios less than 1.0 after assuming
a peak hour factor of 1.0.1

Step 4: Of the 10 study intersections expected to operate with a
v/c ratio over 1.0 during the summer of 2035 after assuming a
1.0 peak hour factor, only two (signalized intersection of US
101/SW 32nd Street and unsignalized intersection of US 101/SE        Figure 3: Alternative Mobility Target Methodology
14th Street) would be expected to also operate with a v/c ratio over 1.0 during an average weekday in 2035.

Step 5: Technical Memorandum #10 (Transportation System Solutions) documents the analysis referred to as
“hours of congestion.” The analysis applied to the soon to be signalized SW 32nd Street intersection, shows the
intersection will exceed capacity for approximately eight consecutive hours during an average weekday in 2035.
The hours of congestion analysis was not reviewed for the unsignalized US 101/SE 14th Street intersection
because the over-capacity condition was related to high delays experienced by a small number of projected
vehicles attempting to turn out of the side street onto US 101. It is likely that under such conditions, these
drivers will avoid the area and reroute to the nearest signalized intersection.

1
 Peak hour factors (PHF) are used to account for the non-uniformity of traffic flow within the peak hour by converting hourly volumes to
peak flow rates associated with a selected interval of time within the peak hour. The most common interval of time selected for traffic
analysis is the peak 15 minutes. A PHF of 1.0 assumes uniform traffic flow within the four 15-minutes periods of the peak hour.

August 22, 2014
Page 11 of 12

Recommended Alternative Mobility Targets
Because the newly signalized intersection at US 101 and 32nd is the only signalized intersection that is forecasted
to exceed the existing OHP Mobility Target values once the analysis methodology is adjusted to assess the
average annual condition, it is the only existing adopted OHP target value that requires an alternative mobility
standard (the intersection at US 101 and NE 22nd also exceeds the adopted target value, but only by 0.01, so it
does not merit any adjustment). In this location, an alternative OHP Mobility Target v/c ratio of 1.0 (an “at full
capacity” condition) for 8 hours per average weekday is recommended for adoption by the Oregon
Transportation Commission (OTC). OTC adoption of the alternative analysis methodology that assesses the
average annual weekday traffic conditions is also recommended for all of US 101 in Lincoln City.

A number of unsignalized intersections on US 101 are also expected to operate above the existing OHP Mobility
Target values at the end of the 20-year planning horizon. The segment where these conditions are expected
runs from the intersection of US 101 and NE Holmes Rd to the intersection of US 101 and SE 29th Street. In this
segment, an alternative OHP Mobility Target v/c ratio of 0.95 for the major street approaches at these
intersections is recommended for adoption by the Oregon Transportation Commission (OTC).

As previously noted, the minor approach at US 101 and SE 14th Street was also forecasted to have demands that
would exceed capacity for multiple hours per average weekday. However, because this forecasted over-
capacity condition is related to high delays experienced by a very small number of vehicles attempting to turn
out of the side street, an alternative OHP Mobility Target for these minor street movements (turns from the
local street onto US 101) is not recommended. It is likely that under such conditions, the few drivers that were
theoretically assigned to use this intersection through the analysis process will, in reality, avoid this intersection
during peak travel periods and reroute to the nearby signalized intersection at US 101 and 12th Street (meaning
that the forecasted operating condition is likely overstated).

US 101 Operations under the Recommended Alternative Mobility Targets
Table 4 compares US 101 traffic operations under the average weekday peak hour to the previously reported
30th highest annual hour. It shows that most intersections would be able to comply with either the existing,
adopted OHP Mobility Targets or the alternative OHP Mobility Targets that are recommended for OTC adoption
through 2035 with implementation of transportation projects identified in the Lincoln City TSP.

FROM:         Darci Rudzinski and Shayna Rehberg, Angelo Planning Group

SUBJECT:      Lincoln City Transportation System Plan (TSP) Update
              Revised Proposed Policy and Code Amendments (Task 6.2)


This memorandum presents draft policy and code amendments for implementing the updated City
of Lincoln City Transportation System Plan (TSP). The proposed amendments in subsequent
sections of this memorandum are based primarily on the following sources:

   x   Draft 2015 Lincoln City Transportation System Plan, TSP Goals;

   x   Recommendations from the 2012 Lincoln City Walking and Biking Plan;

   x   Discussion at Project Management Team (PMT) Meeting #5 (June 25, 2014);

   x   Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) requirements; and

   x   The code and other City documents, particularly the City’s draft update of its Transportation
       System Plan (TSP).

City Planning Commission and City Council will review the draft amendments;. a revised set of
proposed amendments will be considered during the public adoption hearings for the updated TSP.

Transportation Goals and Policies

 The TSP update proposes a new set of transportation policies to include in Lincoln City’s
Comprehensive Plan. The new policies are based on the goals and objectives in the draft TSP. The
Project Management Team (PMT) and the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) have vetted the
policies, which reflect recommendations in the 2012 Lincoln City Walking and Biking Plan, as well
as issues raised at PMT Meeting #5 (June 25, 2014).

Table 1 presents draft policy language. The right-hand column provides the source of the draft
policy language and other information that helps explain the proposed language. This commentary
column indicates the numbered objective from the draft TSP as well as any changes made since June
25, 2014.1 Note that many policies expand and implement the corresponding TSP objective and do
not mirror TSP language exactly; proposed language is intended to provide policy guidance for land
use and transportation decision making after the TSP is adopted.

The formatting of Table 1 numbers each goal; policy numbering reflects the associated goal for easy
reference.

Proposed Policy                                             Commentary

Goal 1: An equitable, balanced and connected multi-modal transportation system.

    Policy 1.1:    Ensure that the transportation system                     Objective 1a
                   provides equitable access to all modes and to
                   underserved and vulnerable populations.

    Policy 1.2:    Ensure that the transportation system is age-             Objective 1a
                   friendly.

    Policy 1.3:    Enhance system efficiency with new or         Objective 4c
                   improved transportation connections that give

Development Code
The following section presents draft proposed amendments to Lincoln City Municipal Code
(LCMC) Title 12 (Streets, Sidewalks and Public Places), Title 16 (Subdivisions), and Title 17
(Zoning). These amendments have been developed in response to the following:

   x   Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) requirements;

   x   Recommendations from the 2012 Lincoln City Walking and Biking Plan;

   x   Discussion at Project Management Team (PMT) Meeting #5 (June 25, 2014); and

   x   Consistency between the code and other City documents, particularly the City’s
       Transportation System Plan (TSP).

The draft amendments are presented in adoption-ready format, although the amendments will
undergo one final round of revisions before an adoption draft is prepared for the first evidentiary
hearing before the Planning Commission. Adoption-ready format means that proposed additions are
underlined and proposed deletions are struck-through. The proposed amendments are organized
sequentially by code section.

Commentary precedes each section of the code that briefly explains the proposed amendment and
includes references to the recommendations from the Code Amendments Recommendations
memorandum (July 7, 2014). The summary recommendation table from that memorandum is
included in this memorandum as Attachment A. In some cases, multiples sets of proposed
amendments apply to a single code section, accompanied by sequential commentary.

Commentary #1:

Consistent with a City request and proposed Policy 4.4, proposed requirements address minimum
clear dimensions for sidewalks.

12.04.070 Unobstructed sidewalks.

Property owners and utility providers shall keep a minimum of five feet of the sidewalk width clear of
both permanent and temporary obstructions (e.g., utility poles, sandwich signs).



Commentary #2:

The provisions in LCMC Chapter 12.28 (Vehicle Access and Circulation) currently apply to a
segment of US 101 and its approach roads. However, the provisions in this chapter are consistent
with Model Development Code for Small Cities (“model code”), require coordination with ODOT
as needed, and grant discretion to the City for implementing the stricter of the provisions (e.g., joint
or cross access, turn restrictions) when appropriate. Due to the flexibility of the existing provisions,
they can readily be expanded to apply citywide. It is recommended that minor changes be made to
these provisions to enable them to apply citywide, as there are not such regulations for vehicle
access and circulation in the city currently. In applying citywide, it is recommended that the chapter
be struck and added as a new section in LCMC Chapter 17.52 (Supplemental Regulations), shown
later in this memorandum (after Commentary #7).

                                 VEHICULAR ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

12.28.200 Vehicular access and circulation.

A. Intent and Purpose. The intent of this section is to manage access to land uses and on-site circulation,
and to preserve the transportation system in terms of safety, capacity, and function while providing
reasonable access for residents and businesses.

B. Applicability. This chapter applies to Highway 101 between SE/SW 12th Street and SE/SW 37th Street,
to all properties that abut the Highway, and to all properties within 200 feet of the Highway that abut
streets intersecting with the Highway. The standards apply when lots are created, consolidated, or
modified through a land division, partition, lot line adjustment, lot consolidation, or street vacation; and
when properties are subject to land use approval or site plan review. The requirements in this chapter
are in addition to requirements relating to properties abutting Highway 101 that are imposed by the
Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) through the provisions of Oregon Administrative Rule
734-051. Where ODOT requires more restrictive provisions than city requirements, ODOT standards
shall prevail.

C. Access Permit Required. Access to Highway 101 (e.g., a new curb cut or driveway approach) requires
an access permit from Lincoln City and a valid approach road permit from the Oregon Department of
Transportation. Access to the intersecting streets identified in subsection (B) of this section also requires
an access permit from the city. An access permit may be in the form of a letter to the applicant, or it
may be attached to a land use decision notice as a condition of approval.

D. Notice to ODOT. Written notice of the following actions shall be provided to ODOT by Lincoln City.
Said notice shall be provided when Lincoln City provides notice to other public agencies and city
departments. When notice to other public agencies and city departments is not provided, Lincoln City
shall provide written notice to ODOT at the same time and manner as public notice is provided to the
general public.

      1. Land use applications that require public hearings;

      2. Subdivision and partition applications;

      3. Other applications that affect private access to Highway 101 or the intersecting streets
      identified in subsection (B) of this section.

E. Traffic Study Requirements. The city may require a traffic impact study prepared by a qualified
professional. ODOT may require such a study for properties abutting Highway 101. The city and ODOT
will use the traffic impact study to make decisions about access, circulation, and other transportation
requirements. It is the intent of the city to coordinate its traffic impact study requirements with ODOT

                                                                                    August 4, 2015
                                                                                          Page 16



so that an applicant need complete only one such study to comply with the requirements of both
agencies.

F. Conditions of Approval. The city may require the closing or consolidation of existing curb cuts or other
vehicle access points, recording of reciprocal access easements (e.g., for shared driveways), turn
restrictions, development of a frontage street, installation of traffic control devices, and/or other
mitigation as a condition of granting an access permit, to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the
street and highway system. Installation of traffic control devices on Highway 101 must be approved by
ODOT.

G. Corner and Intersection Separation – Backing onto Public Streets. New and modified accesses shall
conform to the following standards:

      1. Property access to Highway 101 is under the concurrent jurisdiction of the Oregon Department
      of Transportation (ODOT). Access to streets intersecting with the highway shall not be permitted
      within 100 feet of the intersection unless no other reasonable access to the property is available.
      Where no other alternatives exist, the city may allow construction of an access connection at a
      point less than 100 feet from such an intersection, provided the access is as far away from the
      intersection as possible. In such cases, the city may impose turning restrictions (i.e., right in/out,
      right in only, or right out only). Access to properties with frontage on Highway 101 and other
      public roads shall be provided only from the roads other than the highway whenever reasonable
      access can be provided.

      2. Access to and from off-street parking areas shall not permit backing onto a public street, except
      for single-family dwellings.

      3. The city may reduce required separation distance of access points to city streets where they
      prove impractical due to lot dimensions, existing development, other physical features, or
      conflicting code requirements, provided all of the following requirements are met. Where the
      statewide highway access point spacing requirements in OAR 734-051 cannot be met, all the
      following requirements must be met before the city can complete the “Land Use Compatibility
      Statement for a State Highway Approach” required for a highway approach road application.

           a. Joint-use driveways and cross-access easements are provided in accordance with
           subsection (I) of this section;

           b. The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this
           section; and

           c. The property owner(s) enter in a written agreement with the city, recorded with the deed,
           that pre-existing connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of
           each side of the joint-use driveway.

                                                                                     August 4, 2015
                                                                                           Page 17



H. Site Circulation. New developments shall be required to provide a circulation system that
accommodates expected traffic on the site. Pedestrian connections on the site, including connections
through large sites, and connections between sites (as applicable) and adjacent sidewalks, must be
sufficient to safely accommodate expected pedestrian traffic to, from, within, and across the site.

I. Joint- and Cross-Access – Requirement. The number of driveway and private street intersections with
public streets should be minimized by the use of shared driveways for adjoining lots where feasible.
When necessary for traffic safety and access management purposes, or to access flag lots, the city
and/or ODOT (for access to Highway 101) may require joint access and/or shared driveways in the
following situations:

      1. For shared parking areas;

      2. For adjacent developments, where access onto an arterial or collector is proposed;

      3. For multitenant developments, and developments on multiple lots or parcels. For such joint
      accesses and shared driveways the city may require the applicant to incorporate any of the
      following, among other requirements:

           a. A continuous service drive or cross-access corridor that provides for driveway separation
           consistent with the applicable transportation authority’s access management classification
           system and standards;

           b. A design speed of 10 miles per hour and a maximum width of 24 feet, in addition to any
           parking alongside the driveway; additional driveway width or fire lanes may be approved
           when necessary to accommodate specific types of service vehicles, loading vehicles, or
           emergency service provider vehicles;

           c. Driveway stubs to property lines (for future extension) and other design features to make
           it easy to see that the abutting properties may be required with future development to
           connect to the cross-access driveway;

J. Joint- and Cross-Access – Reduction in Required Parking Allowed. When a shared driveway is provided
or required as a condition of approval, the land uses adjacent to the shared driveway may have their
minimum parking standards reduced in accordance with the shared parking provisions of
LCMC 17.56.060.

K. Joint- and Cross-Access – Easement and Use and Maintenance Agreement. Pursuant to this section,
property owners shall:

      1. Record an easement with the deed allowing cross-access to and from other properties served
      by the joint-use driveways and cross-access or service drive;

                                                                                   August 4, 2015
                                                                                         Page 18



      2. Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the roadway for the
      subject property shall be dedicated to the city and pre-existing driveways will be closed and
      eliminated after construction of the joint-use driveway;

      3. Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of
      property owners.

L. Access Connections and Driveway Design. All driveway connections to a public right-of-way (access)
and driveways shall conform to all of the following design standards:

      1. Driveways to city streets shall meet the following standards:

           a. One-way driveways (one-way in or out) shall have a minimum driveway width of 10 feet,
           and a maximum width of 12 feet, and shall have appropriate signage designating the
           driveway as a one-way connection.

           b. For two-way access, each lane shall have a minimum width of 10 feet and a maximum
           width of 12 feet.

      Driveways to Highway 101 shall meet ODOT requirements for design and construction.

      2. Driveways shall be designed and located to provide exiting vehicles with an unobstructed view
      of other vehicles and pedestrians, and to prevent vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on
      the public street or causing conflicts with on-site circulation. Construction of driveway accesses
      along acceleration or deceleration lanes or tapers should be avoided due to the potential for
      vehicular conflicts. Driveways should be located to allow for safe maneuvering in and around
      loading areas.

      3. Driveway aprons (when required) shall be constructed of concrete and shall be installed
      between the street right-of-way and the private drive, as shown in Figure 12.28.200A. Driveway
      aprons shall conform to ADA requirements for sidewalks and walkways, which generally require a
      continuous unobstructed route of travel that is not less than three feet in width, with a cross slope
      not exceeding two percent, and providing for landing areas and ramps at intersections.

M. Fire Access and Turnarounds. When required under the Uniform Fire Code, fire access lanes with
turnarounds shall be provided. Except as waived in writing by the fire marshal, a fire equipment access
drive shall be provided for any portion of an exterior wall of the first story of a building that is located
more than 150 feet from an existing public street or approved fire equipment access drive. The drive
shall contain unobstructed adequate aisle width (14 to 20 feet) and turn-around area for emergency
vehicles. The fire marshal may require that fire lanes be marked as “No Stopping/No Parking.”

N. Vertical Clearances. Driveways, private streets, aisles, turn-around areas and ramps shall have a
minimum vertical clearance of 13 feet and six inches for their entire length and width.

O. Clear Vision Areas. No visual obstruction (e.g., sign, structure, solid fence, or shrub vegetation) may
be placed in a clear vision area except in accordance with LCMC 17.52.060. The minimum clear vision
area may be modified by the city engineer with the concurrence of the planning director upon finding
that more or less sight distance is required (i.e., due to traffic speeds, roadway alignment, etc.). ODOT
shall establish clear vision requirements for Highway 101, but if the city’s clear vision requirements are

P. Construction. The following development and maintenance standards shall apply to all driveways and
private streets, except that the standards do not apply to driveways serving one single-family detached
dwelling. For properties abutting Highway 101, development and maintenance requirements
established as a part of an ODOT approach road permit also shall apply.

      1. Surface Options. Driveways, parking areas, aisles, and turnarounds may be paved with asphalt,
      concrete, or comparable surfacing, or a durable nonpaving or porous paving material may be used
      to reduce surface water runoff and protect water quality. Driveway and street materials shall be
      subject to review and approval by the city engineer.

      2. Surface Water Management. When nonporous paving is used, all driveways, parking areas,
      aisles, and turnarounds shall have on-site collection of surface waters to eliminate sheet flow of
      such waters onto public rights-of-way and abutting property. Surface water facilities shall be
      constructed in conformance with applicable engineering standards.

      3. Driveway Aprons. When driveway approaches or “aprons” are required to connect driveways to
      the public right-of-way, they shall be paved with concrete surfacing and conform to the city’s
      engineering design criteria and standard specifications. (See general illustrations in Figure
      12.28.200A.)



Commentary #3:

Proposed amendments update existing subdivision block size requirements to make them consistent
with access spacing standards established in the TSP.

Proposed modifications amend existing subdivision provisions to make pedestrian/bicycle access
ways a requirement instead of a discretionary decision by the Planning Commission. The following
proposed language provides exceptions and design specifications.

Per Recommendation 10, a reference to local street design standards in the TSP has been added in
subdivision street standards, and the minimum right-of-way and roadway table has been replaced
with this reference. A reference to the public works/engineering standards should be added if the
street design standards will be incorporated into that document.

The amendments propose deletion of language pertaining to “other sidewalks” not being required of
the subdivider or partitioner. Off-site transportation improvements, including sidewalks, may be a
condition of approval, based on the findings of the transportation impact analysis. (See
recommendation 6c in Attachment A.)

                                           DESIGN STANDARDS

16.12.170 Block sizes.

Blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length, except blocks adjacent to arterial streets or Block sizes shall
conform to the access spacing standards in the city Transportation System Plan unless the previous
adjacent layout or topographical conditions justify a variation. The recommended minimum distance
between intersections on major streets is 1,800 feet.

16.12.200 Easements – Pedestrian and bicycle access ways.

When the planning commission determines pedestrian ways to be essential for public convenience, such
ways may be required to connect two culs-de-sac between streets in long blocks between streets and
other public or semipublic lands or through major or minor greenway systems. In any block over 750
feet in length, a pedestrian way with a minimum width of eight feet or combination pedestrian way and
utility easement may be required through the middle of the block. If unusual conditions require blocks
longer than 1,200 feet, two pedestrian ways may be required. Long blocks parallel to arterial streets
may be approved without pedestrian ways if desirable in the interests of traffic safety.

A. Where applicable, pedestrian and bicycle access ways shall be provided to achieve the following
connections, as generally illustrated in the Figure 16.12.200A:

      1. from the head of a cul-de-sac to the nearest street, including cases where the nearest street is a
      segment of the same street leading to the head of the cul-de-sac where the street consists of tight
      curves;

      2. between streets on either side of a long block (more than 750 feet in length), with at least one
      access way for every 750 feet in block length;

      3. from or between other existing or approved pedestrian and bicycle access ways; and

      4. other connections as determined necessary by the planning commission.

Commentary #4:

Proposed amendments require pedestrian/bicycle access ways in subdivisions and define access way
in LCMC Chapter 17.08. (See Recommendation 6c in Attachment A.)

Proposed language also adds on-site and site-to-site pedestrian/bicycle circulation and access
requirements for uses other than commercial uses; and includes a definition for these pedestrian and
bicycle circulation and access facilities (pathways) in LCMC Chapter 17.08. (See Recommendations
6a and 6b in Attachment A.)

New definitions in 17.08 define shared streets and shared-use paths. (See Recommendation 13b in
Attachment A.)

The amendments permit transportation uses addressed in the TPR outright in the base zones in
LCMC 17.16-17.45 and add a definition for “transportation uses” is in LCMC Chapter 17.08. (See
Recommendation 1 in Attachment A.)

“Access” means the way or means by which pedestrians and vehicles enter and leave property.

”Access way” means a pedestrian and/or bicycle connection between two rights-of-way, or to achieve
other connectivity needs as determined by the planning commission. An access way conforms to city
standards and is in either an off-street public right-of-way or a public access easement on private
property.

“Accessory structure” or “accessory use” means a structure or use incidental and subordinate to the
main use of property and located on the same lot as the main use, including any required off-street
parking within 200 feet (measured in a straight line) of the building or use it is intended to serve.

[…]

“Owner” means the person in whom is vested the ownership, dominion or title of property; proprietor;
including an authorized agent of the owner.

”Pathway” means a pedestrian and/or bicycle way on private property that provides pedestrian and/or
bicycle circulation within a site and to adjacent sites and facilities.

“Perennial” means a landscape plant that persists for several years with new herbaceous growth from a
part that lives over from one growing season to another.

“Screening” means the visual shielding of one structure or use from another structure or use by fences,
walls, berms, or densely planted vegetation so as, on installation, to substantially, but not necessarily
totally, eliminate visual impacts of the shielded structure or use on the other structure or use.

“Shared street” means a low-volume and low-speed street, as designated in the city Transportation
System Plan, used by pedestrians, bicyclists, and motor vehicles, and where pedestrians have priority
over motor vehicles and bicyclists. Shared streets do not have clear division between pedestrian and
motor vehicle space (e.g., no continuous curb) and typically include such features as street furniture
(e.g., planters, street trees, benches) and areas for social interaction. Design criteria for shared streets
are included in the Transportation System Plan.

”Shared-use path” means a facility for non-motorized travel outside of the roadway, intended for
transportation and recreation or both. Typical design standards for shared-use paths are in the city
Transportation System Plan.

“Shoreline” means the boundary line between a body of water and land, measured on tidal waters at
mean high water, and on non-tidal waterways at the ordinary high water mark.

[...]

“Transitional area” means an area consisting of a lot, lots or parts of lots, within any residential district,
having side lot lines abutting a boundary of a commercial or industrial zone, and extending not more
than 100 feet from such boundary into the residential zone.

“Transportation uses” means transportation facilities, services, and improvements as identified in the
Transportation Planning Rule, OAR 660-012-0045(1), including:

        x   Operation, maintenance, and repair of existing transportation facilities identified in the city
            Transportation System Plan;

        x   Dedication of right-of-way, authorization of construction, and the construction of facilities and
            improvements, where the improvements are consistent with clear and objective dimensional
            standards; and

        x   Changes in the frequency of transit, rail, and airport services.

“Underlying zone” means the existing zone on the property at the time of application.

Commentary #5:

Additions to public infrastructure improvement standards under Supplementary Regulations (LCMC
17.52.230) refer to local street design standards in the TSP and to the public works/engineering
standards (if the street design standards are incorporated into that document). (See
Recommendation 10 in Attachment A.) Proposed provisions require transit amenities (or
easements/dedications for amenities) in coordination with Lincoln County Transit or other
applicable transit agencies. The proposed provisions are based on TPR language and language used
in several communities. (See Recommendation 7 in Attachment A.) Reflecting City direction, new
language addresses property owner responsibility for the maintenance of sidewalks, landscape strips,
and curbs. Fee in lieu provisions replace deferred improvement agreements (See Recommendation
12 in Attachment A.)

            125 percent of the cost to perform the work, as determined by the city engineer, based on
            the applicable city standards in effect at the time of application. The applicant shall pay the
            fee prior to plat recording or issuance of a building or development permit. The city shall use
            all such fees for construction, repair, or maintenance of the public infrastructure
            improvements named above within the city of Lincoln City; and […]



Commentary #6:

Recommended modifications to site plan review criteria include applying pedestrian/bicycle
circulation and access requirements to other uses in addition to commercial. The new section on
pedestrian and bicycle circulation and access addresses not only connections within and between
sites, but access to transit stops, pathway/driveway separation, pathway surface and width
specifications, and ADA compliance. (See Recommendations 6a and 6b in Attachment A.)

17.52.240 Site plan review.

A. Purpose […]

B. Site Plan Review Criteria. A site plan review application shall demonstrate that:

1. The proposed development will comply with all of the applicable requirements of this title; and

2. The arrangement of all buildings and structures, access points, parking and loading facilities,
landscaping, lighting, walls and fences, and stormwater detention, treatment, and drainage features and
facilities will avoid traffic congestion and will provide for pedestrian and vehicular safety and welfare.
See LCMC 12.28.200 for detailed requirements regarding vehicle access and circulation and LCMC
17.52.290 for detailed requirements regarding pedestrian/bicycle access and circulation.

[…]

17.52.280 Vehicle access and circulation. [This is a proposed new section presented next in this
memorandum, following Commentary #7.]

17.52.290 Pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation.

A. Purpose. This section implements city pedestrian and bicycle access and connectivity policies to
provide for safe, reasonably direct, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation within
a site and between a site and adjacent sites and facilities.

B. Applicability and standards. Developments subject to site plan review, pursuant to LCMC 17.52.240,

shall conform to all of the following standards for pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation:

      1. Continuous pathway system. A pathway system shall extend throughout the development site
      and connect to adjacent sidewalks, adjacent existing and planned transit stops, and adjacent sites
      as applicable and feasible.

      2. Safe, direct, and convenient. Pathways within a development site shall provide connections
      between primary building entrances and all adjacent parking areas, recreational areas, and public
      rights-of-way that meet all of the following criteria:

          a. The pathway is reasonably direct, following a route that does not deviate unnecessarily
          from a straight line or at minimum, does not involve a significant amount of out-of-direction
          travel;

          b. The pathway is designed primarily for pedestrian and bicyclist safety and convenience,
          meaning it is free from hazards, provides a reasonably smooth and consistent surface, and the
          route of travel between destinations minimizes vehicular-pedestrian conflict points. It has a
          three-foot landscape buffer separating pathways and adjacent parking lots or driveways to
          mitigate safety concerns.

          c. The pathway network connects to all primary building entrances, in conformance with
          applicable Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.

      3. Pathway/parking area drive aisle separation. Where a pathway abuts a parking area drive aisle,
      the drive aisle shall have a curb along the abutting edge and the sidewalk shall be six inches higher
      than the edge of the drive aisle. Alternatively, the city engineer may approve a pathway at the
      same grade as the drive aisle, if the pathway is physically separated from all vehicle maneuvering
      areas by, for example, a row of bollards (designed for use in parking areas) spaced to prevent
      vehicles from entering the pathway.

      4. Crossing parking areas and driveways. Where a pathway crosses a parking area or driveway, it
      shall be marked clearly with contrasting paving materials (e.g., pavers, light-color concrete inlay
      between asphalt, or similar contrast). The crossing may be part of a speed table to improve driver-
      visibility of pedestrians. If crossings involve grade changes, the crossing shall include ADA
      accessible ramps. Painted striping, thermo-plastic striping, and similar types of non-permanent
      applications are not as desirable, but may be approved for lower-volume crossings of 24 feet or
      less.

      5. Pathway surface and width. Pathways shall be concrete, asphalt, brick/masonry pavers, or
      another city-approved durable surface meeting ADA requirements. Pathways shall be at least four
      feet in width, except in commercial developments, where they must be at least six feet in width.
      The community development director may require wider pathways in developments likely to have
      high volumes of pedestrian and bicycle traffic that warrant wider width.

Commentary #7:

As was addressed earlier in this memorandum (Commentary #2), it is recommended that the
existing chapter regarding vehicle access and circulation be amended to apply the provisions citywide
and that the chapter be made into a new section in LCMC Chapter 17.52 (Supplemental
Regulations). While shown in underlined text to signify the addition of a new chapter, much of this
text is original (existing adopted language), with the exception of the following:

1. The subsection on traffic study requirements is proposed to be replaced with a reference to an
expanded set of requirements in LCMC 17.52.300 [new TIS section].

2. Corner and intersection separation (spacing) standards in Subsection G have been updated to
include the standards table from the Draft TSP.

3. A reference to the new section regarding pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation (LCMC
17.52.290) has been added to the site circulation subsection (Subsection H).

17.52.280 Vehicle access and circulation

A. Intent and Purpose. The intent of this section is to manage access to land uses and on-site circulation,
and to preserve the transportation system in terms of safety, capacity, and function while providing
reasonable access for residents and businesses.

B. Applicability. The standards of this section apply to lots created, consolidated, or modified through a
land division, partition, lot line adjustment, lot consolidation, or street vacation; and to properties
subject to land use approval or site plan review. The requirements in this chapter are in addition to
requirements relating to properties abutting Highway 101 that are imposed by the Oregon Department
of Transportation (ODOT) through the provisions of Oregon Administrative Rule 734-051. Where ODOT
requires more restrictive provisions than city requirements, ODOT standards shall prevail.

C. Access Permit Required. Access (e.g., a new curb cut or driveway approach) to Highway 101 requires
an access permit from Lincoln City and a valid approach road permit from the Oregon Department of
Transportation. Access to other streets in the city requires an access permit from the city or Lincoln
County as appropriate. An access permit may be in the form of a letter to the applicant, or it may be
attached to a land use decision notice as a condition of approval.

D. Notice to ODOT. Written notice of the following actions shall be provided to ODOT by Lincoln City.
Said notice shall be provided when Lincoln City provides notice to other public agencies and city
departments. When notice to other public agencies and city departments is not provided, Lincoln City
shall provide written notice to ODOT at the same time and manner as public notice is provided to the
general public.

                                                                                           Page 40



      1. Land use applications that require public hearings;

      2. Subdivision and partition applications;

      3. Other applications that affect private access to Highway 101 or the intersecting streets
      identified in subsection (B) of this section.

E. Traffic Impact Study (TIS) Requirements. The city may require a traffic impact study prepared by a
qualified professional, pursuant to requirements in LCMC 17.52.300. ODOT may require such a study for
properties abutting Highway 101 or relying on this facility for access. The city and ODOT will use the TIS
to make decisions about access, circulation, and other transportation requirements. The city will
coordinate its traffic impact study requirements with ODOT, so that an applicant need complete only
one such study to comply with the requirements of both agencies.

F. Conditions of Approval. The city may require the closing or consolidation of existing curb cuts or other
vehicle access points, recording of reciprocal access easements (e.g., for shared driveways), turn
restrictions, development of a frontage street, installation of traffic control devices, and/or other
mitigation as a condition of granting an access permit, to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the
street and highway system. Installation of traffic control devices on Highway 101 must be approved by
ODOT.

G. Corner and Intersection Separation – Backing onto Public Streets. New and modified accesses shall
conform to the following standards:

      1. Property access to Highway 101 shall comply with ODOT standards. New access to local streets
      intersecting with the highway shall be consistent with access spacing standards in Table
      17.52.280A below. Where no other alternative exists for property access, the city may allow
      construction of an access connection at a point less than the distance required below, provided
      the access is as far away from the intersection as possible. In such cases, the city may impose
      turning restrictions (i.e., right in/out, right in only, or right out only). For properties with frontage
      both on Highway 101 and another public street, access shall be from the local street wherever
      reasonable.

      2. Access to and from off-street parking areas, except those for single-family dwellings, shall not
      permit backing onto a public street.

      3. The city may reduce required separation distance of access points to city streets where they
      prove impractical due to lot dimensions, existing development, other physical features, or
      conflicting code requirements, provided all of the following requirements are met.

      3. The city may reduce required separation distance of access points to city streets where they
      prove impractical due to lot dimensions, existing development, other physical features, or
      conflicting code requirements, provided all of the following requirements are met. Where the
      statewide highway access point spacing requirements in OAR 734-051 cannot be met, all the
      following requirements must be met before the city can complete the “Land Use Compatibility
      Statement for a State Highway Approach” required for a highway approach road application.

           a. Joint-use driveways and cross-access easements are provided in accordance with
           subsection (I) of this section;

           b. The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this
           section; and

           c. The property owner(s) enter in a written agreement with the city, recorded with the deed,
           that pre-existing connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of
           each side of the joint-use driveway.

H. Site Circulation. New developments shall provide a circulation system that accommodates expected
traffic on the site. Pedestrian connections on the site, including connections through large sites, and
connections between sites (as applicable) and adjacent sidewalks must be sufficient to accommodate
expected pedestrian traffic safely to, from, within, and across the site. See LCMC 17.52.290 for more
detailed requirements regarding pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation.

I. Joint- and Cross-Access – Requirement. The number of driveway and private street intersections with
public streets should be minimized by the use of shared driveways for adjoining lots where feasible.
When necessary for traffic safety and access management purposes, or to access flag lots, the city
and/or ODOT (for access to Highway 101) may require joint access and/or shared driveways in the
following situations:

      1. For shared parking areas;

      2. For adjacent developments, where access onto an arterial or collector is proposed;

                                                                                   August 4, 2015
                                                                                         Page 42



      3. For multitenant developments, and developments on multiple lots or parcels. For such joint
      accesses and shared driveways the city may require the applicant to incorporate any of the
      following, among other requirements:

           a. A continuous service drive or cross-access corridor that provides for driveway separation
           consistent with the applicable transportation authority’s access management classification
           system and standards;

           b. A design speed of 10 miles per hour and a maximum width of 24 feet, in addition to any
           parking alongside the driveway; additional driveway width or fire lanes may be approved
           when necessary to accommodate specific types of service vehicles, loading vehicles, or
           emergency service provider vehicles;

           c. Driveway stubs to property lines (for future extension) and other design features to make
           it easy to see that the abutting properties may be required with future development to
           connect to the cross-access driveway;

J. Joint- and Cross-Access – Reduction in Required Parking Allowed. When a shared driveway is provided
or required as a condition of approval, the land uses adjacent to the shared driveway may have their
minimum parking standards reduced in accordance with the shared parking provisions of
LCMC 17.56.060.

K. Joint- and Cross-Access – Easement and Use and Maintenance Agreement. Pursuant to this section,
property owners shall:

      1. Record an easement with the deed allowing cross-access to and from other properties served
      by the joint-use driveways and cross-access or service drive;

      2. Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the roadway for the
      subject property shall be dedicated to the city and pre-existing driveways will be closed and
      eliminated after construction of the joint-use driveway;

      3. Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of
      property owners.

L. Access Connections and Driveway Design. All driveway connections to a public right-of-way (access)
and driveways shall conform to all of the following design standards:

      1. Driveways to city streets shall meet the following standards:

           a. One-way driveways (one-way in or out) shall have a minimum driveway width of 10 feet,
           and a maximum width of 12 feet, and shall have appropriate signage designating the
           driveway as a one-way connection.

     b. For two-way access, each lane shall have a minimum width of 10 feet and a maximum
     width of 12 feet.

Driveways to Highway 101 shall meet ODOT requirements for design and construction.

2. Driveways shall be designed and located to provide exiting vehicles with an unobstructed view
of other vehicles and pedestrians, and to prevent vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on
the public street or causing conflicts with on-site circulation. Construction of driveway accesses
along acceleration or deceleration lanes or tapers should be avoided due to the potential for
vehicular conflicts. Driveways should be located to allow for safe maneuvering in and around
loading areas.

3. Driveway aprons (when required) shall be constructed of concrete and shall be installed
between the street right-of-way and the private drive, as shown in Figure 17.52.280A. Driveway
aprons shall conform to ADA requirements for sidewalks and walkways, which generally require a
continuous unobstructed route of travel that is not less than three feet in width, with a cross slope
not exceeding two percent, and providing for landing areas and ramps at intersections.

M. Fire Access and Turnarounds. When required under the Uniform Fire Code, fire access lanes with
turnarounds shall be provided. Except as waived in writing by the fire marshal, a fire equipment access
drive shall be provided for any portion of an exterior wall of the first story of a building that is located
more than 150 feet from an existing public street or approved fire equipment access drive. The drive
shall contain unobstructed adequate aisle width (14 to 20 feet) and turn-around area for emergency
vehicles. The fire marshal may require that fire lanes be marked as “No Stopping/No Parking.”

N. Vertical Clearances. Driveways, private streets, aisles, turn-around areas and ramps shall have a
minimum vertical clearance of 13 feet and six inches for their entire length and width.

O. Clear Vision Areas. No visual obstruction (e.g., sign, structure, solid fence, or shrub vegetation) may
be placed in a clear vision area except in accordance with LCMC 17.52.060. The minimum clear vision
area may be modified by the city engineer with the concurrence of the planning director upon finding
that more or less sight distance is required (i.e., due to traffic speeds, roadway alignment, etc.). ODOT
shall establish clear vision requirements for Highway 101, but if the city’s clear vision requirements are
more restrictive, the city’s requirements shall prevail.

P. Construction. The following development and maintenance standards shall apply to all driveways and
private streets, except that the standards do not apply to driveways serving one single-family detached
dwelling. For properties abutting Highway 101, development and maintenance requirements
established as a part of an ODOT approach road permit also shall apply.

      1. Surface Options. Driveways, parking areas, aisles, and turnarounds may be paved with asphalt,
      concrete, or comparable surfacing, or a durable nonpaving or porous paving material may be used
      to reduce surface water runoff and protect water quality. Driveway and street materials shall be
      subject to review and approval by the city engineer.

      2. Surface Water Management. When nonporous paving is used, all driveways, parking areas,
      aisles, and turnarounds shall have on-site collection of surface waters to eliminate sheet flow of
      such waters onto public rights-of-way and abutting property. Surface water facilities shall be
      constructed in conformance with applicable engineering standards.

3. Driveway Aprons. When driveway approaches or “aprons” are required to connect driveways to the
public right-of-way, they shall be paved with concrete surfacing and conform to the city’s engineering
design criteria and standard specifications. (See general illustrations in Figure 17.52.280A.)



Commentary #8:

Amendments expand upon existing traffic study requirements in 12.28.200(E.) with provisions
regarding applicability, general preparation, and approval criteria. Requirements are based on
language from the State model code and from code recently developed for other small- and

medium-sized jurisdictions in Oregon. Mobility standards for local streets established in the TSP are
in the proposed approval criteria provisions. (See Recommendations 3a and 3b in Attachment A.)

15.52.300 Traffic Impact Study (TIS) Requirements.

    1. Purpose. The purpose of traffic impact study (TIS) requirements is to implement Sections 660-
    012-0045(2)(b) and (e) of the Oregon Transportation Planning Rule that require the city to adopt
    standards and a process to protect the future operations of roadways and transit corridors. This
    section establishes when a land use application requires a TIS to determine improvements needed
    to minimize impacts to transportation facilities and the section establishes approval criteria to
    ensure adequate facilities for both motorized and non-motorized modes of transportation.

    The city and ODOT will use the TIS to make decisions about access, circulation, and other
    transportation requirements. The city will coordinate its traffic impact study requirements with
    ODOT, so that an applicant need complete only one such study to comply with the requirements of
    both agencies.

    2. Applicability. A TIS shall accompany a land use application at the request of the city engineer, if
    the proposal involves one or more of the following:

        a. An amendment to the Lincoln City Comprehensive Plan or zoning map.

        b. A new direct property approach road to US 101.

        c. Likely generation of 50 or more PM peak-hour trips on US 101, or 100 or more PM peak-hour
        trips on the local transportation system, according to (source).

        d. An increase in use of any adjacent street or direct property approach road to US 101 by 10
        vehicles or more per day that exceed 20,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.

        e. An existing or proposed access driveway that does not meet minimum spacing or sight
        distance requirements, or a driveway located where vehicles entering or leaving the property
        are restricted, or such vehicles are likely to queue or hesitate at an approach or access
        connection, thereby creating a safety hazard.

        f. A change in internal traffic patterns that may cause safety problems, such as back-up onto
        the highway or traffic crashes in the approach area.

3. Preparation. An Oregon registered professional engineer qualified to perform traffic
engineering analysis shall prepare the TIS at the applicant’s expense. The city engineer and ODOT
staff, as appropriate, shall determine whether the contents of the TIS is sufficient.

4. Approval Criteria.

    a. The study complies with the content requirements set forth by the city engineer and ODOT
    staff as appropriate;

    b. The study demonstrates that adequate transportation facilities exist to serve the proposed
    land use action or identifies mitigation measures that resolve identified traffic safety problems
    in a manner that is satisfactory to the city engineer and, if State facilities are affected, to ODOT;

    c. For affected city facilities, the TIS demonstrates the project meets mobility and other
    applicable performance standards established in the adopted city Transportation System Plan
    have been met; and

    d. Proposed design and construction of transportation improvements are in accordance with
    the street design standards and the access spacing standards specified in the Transportation
    System Plan.

Commentary #9:

Proposed requirements allow transit-related uses in off-street parking areas so long as the lots
continue to meet minimum parking requirements. (See Recommendation 9 in Attachment A.)

Preferential carpool and vanpool parking provisions, added to parking lot development standards,
apply to parking lots over a specified size or number of parking spaces. Proposed language could
incentivize the use of van pool/car pools in the future, especially for large employers. (See
Recommendation 8 in Attachment A.)

Bicycle parking requirements proposed for addition to LCMC 17.56 apply to all uses, except for
housing with fewer than four units. The proposed requirements for the number of bicycle parking
spaces are based on those recommended in the State model code; the use categories for these
requirements are derived from those used for the city’s vehicle parking requirements. The model
code provides basic bicycle parking location and design requirements, and these requirements are
recommended for Lincoln City. (See Recommendation 5 in Attachment A.) City staff requested that
provisions also be proposed for allowing reductions in off-street vehicle parking requirements based
on bicycle parking spaces being provided.

A. Areas needed to meet the parking requirements of a particular building or use shall not be
transformed or changed to another type of use, or transferred to meet the parking requirements of
another building or use, until the parking required for the original user of said parking area is provided at
another location. Such required parking shall be available for the parking of operable passenger vehicles
of residents, customers, patrons and employees only, and shall not be used for the storage of vehicles or
materials, or for the parking of trucks used in the conduct of the business or use.

B. Portions of off-street parking areas may be developed or redeveloped for transit-related uses such as
transit shelters or park-and-ride lots, subject to meeting all other applicable standards.

M. Preferential Carpool/Vanpool Parking. Parking lots for uses with designated employee parking and
with more than 20 parking spaces shall provide at least 5% of these spaces as preferential long-term
carpool and vanpool parking spaces, with a minimum of one space and rounding up fractions of spaces.
Preferential carpool and vanpool parking spaces shall be closer to the primary employee entrance of the
building than other parking spaces, with the exception of ADA accessible parking spaces, and shall be
marked as preferential carpool and vanpool parking.

17.56.120 Reductions in Parking Requirements. Reductions in the minimum required vehicle parking
standards in LCMC 17.56.50 may be granted by the community development director as part of the
development permit application review and approval process.

A. A reduction of one vehicle parking space per two bicycle parking spaces may be permitted, up to a
maximum reduction of 10% of the minimum required vehicle parking spaces.

17.56.130 Bicycle Parking.

At a minimum, required bicycle parking shall be consistent with the following standards:

A. Location. All bicycle parking shall be within 100 feet of the primary building entrance; located within a
well-lighted area; and clearly visible from the primary building entrance. Where necessary, a sign shall

  Traffic Calming
  Chicanes reduce vehicle speeds by creating a
  winding street pattern. These are typically
  appropriate on low volume streets.

                                                              Chokers reduce the roadway width through curb
                                                              extensions. These are typically appropriate on low
                                                              volume streets with on-street parking.

  Raised Crosswalks act as speed
  humps by vertically deflecting
  vehicles. These are typically
  appropriate at midblock
  pedestrian crossings. This
  treatment can be found on SW
  Jetty Avenue in Cutler.

Raised Intersections are
intersections elevated to the
curb height, thus vertically
deflecting vehicles as they
approach intersection
crosswalks.

                                  Speed Feedback Signs are roadside signs that read vehicle speeds and
                                  present the approaching motorist with a message. Messages can tell a
                                  motorist how fast he/she is driving, the speed limit, to slow down, or other
                                  programmable messages. These signs can be effective on higher speed
                                  roadways where horizontal and vertical deflection is not an appropriate
                                  measure.

Speed Humps are highly effective at slowing motorists. However, consideration should be given to driver
discomfort. Speed humps are not appropriate along common routes for emergency vehicles.



Speed Tables are flat and longer than speed
humps. While they are not as effective at slowing
motorists, they are more comfortable to drive
over.

Stop Signs can be used at intersections to break up long stretches of unimpedied roadway, effectively slowing
motorists and discouraging through-traffic on local roadways.



Street Closures reduce traffic
volumes on local roadways by
placing a physical barrier across
the roadway, effectively
preveneting through-travel .
Barriers should be designed to
allow for pedestrian and bicycle
travel. Street closures can be
designed to allow for emergency
through-travel.

                                                           Traffic Circles are raised, circular islands placed in the
                                                           center of an intersection. Careful consideration must
                                                           be given when choosing this device as this it may

                                                           intersection, and it can be difficult for larger vehicles to
                                                           maneuver around it.

Street Crossings
Project C1. New Crossing Between NW 39th Street and NW 36th Street

                                                     Begin add lane just north of
                                                     the median refuge island

                                             as a left turn lane

Closest alternative crossings:

x   NW Logan Road – signalized, 650 feet to the north.
x   Mid-block crossing between NW 34th Street and NW 33rd Street – flashing yellow beacon and median refuge
    island, 1,125 feet to the south.

Recommendations:

x   Begin the 2nd northbound travel lane just north of NW 39th Street. Absorb the 2nd northbound lane south of
    NW 39th Street into the two-way left-turn lane. Just would allow for both pedestrian and southbound left
    turning refuge. This could impact northbound queuing at the NW Logan Road intersection.
x   Continental crosswalk markings.
x   Pedestrian-activated flashing yellow beacons.
x   Pedestrian crosswalk signs.
x   Advanced stop bars.
x   Advanced flashing yellow beacons and warning signs may be needed due to the curvature of the highway.

                                                       Extended No-Parking Zones




Closest alternative crossings:

x   NW 21st Street – unsignalized with median refuge island, 825 feet to the north of NW 18th Street.
x   NW 17th Street – signalized, 175 feet to the south of NW 18th Street and 200 feet to the north of NW 16th
    Street.
x   NW 15th Street – unsignalized, 225 feet to the south of NW 16th Street.

Recommendations:

x   Expand no-parking zones to extend from the crosswalk to the advanced stop bars (this would extend the no-
    parking zones from 20 feet to 30 feet).
x   Consider pedestrian crossing signs at stop bars if they can be clearly seen by motorists, and would not block
    the existing crossing signs at the crossing.

There are currently marked unsignalized crosswalks at NW 15th Street, NW 13th Street, NW 12th Street, and NE
11th Street. Signalized crosswalks are provided at NW 14th Street.
Closest alternative crossings to this segment of highway:

x   NW 16th Street – unsignalized, 225 feet to the north.
x   NW 6th Drive – signalized, 850 feet to the south.

Recommendations:

x   Expand no-parking zones around NW 15th Street and NW 13th Street to extend from the crosswalk to the
    advanced stop bars (this would extend the no-parking zones from 20 feet to 30 feet).
x   Median refuge island on north approach of the intersection with NE 11th Street, aligning with existing
    crosswalk (southbound left turn traffic could no longer use the center left turn lane and would need to use
    the turn lane at NE 12th Street or NE 10th Street).
x   Pedestrian crosswalk signs at stop bars.
x   A PAC member expressed concern regarding the angled crossing. The east wheelchair ramp is slightly north
    of the intersection, likely due to the location of the storm drain. The west wheelchair ramp is at the
    intersection, as preferred. Overall, straightening the crossing would not provide a clear safety benefit due to
    driver expectancy of pedestrian crossings.

Closest alternative crossings:

x   SE 1st Street – signalized, 825 feet to the north.
x   City Hall/Library – signalized, 1,400 feet to the south.

Closest alternative crossings:

x   SE East Devils Lake Road – signalized, 1,625 feet to the north.
x   Planned crossing at SW 29th Street - unsignalized with median refuge island, 3,400 feet to the south (part of
    upcoming ODOT project currently under design).

Recommendations:

x   Median refuge island between SW Bard Road and SE 19th Street (this may require restricting the left turn
    movement out of SW Bard Road, with vehicles required to detour north up SW Harbor Avenue).
x   Construct curb extension on west side of US 101 at north corner of SW Bard Street (uses space currently
    striped as shoulder and likely used as de facto right turn lane).
x   Continental crosswalk markings.
x   Pedestrian crosswalk signs.
x   Advanced stop bars.
x   A PAC member expressed concern regarding motorists speeding for position for the southbound lane drop,
    and suggested moving the crossing north. However, moving the crossing north would impact the
    southbound left movement, which is a high demand movement, and it would locate the crossing far from
    SW Bard Road. If this conflict is an issue, the lane drop could be move north of the crossing.

Recommendations:

x   Median refuge island, mid-block south of SE High School Drive and north of the next driveways.
x   Continental crosswalk markings.
x   Pedestrian crosswalk signs.
x   Advanced stop bars.
x   The PAC agreed that a crossing improvement is not needed at this location.

x   SW 51st Street – signalized, 300 feet to the south

Recommendations:

x   Change crosswalk striping to continental markings.
x   Consider straightening the crossing to avoid confusion for the vision impaired (will require minor shortening
    of bus pullout on east side).
x   Advanced stop bar in northbound direction (explore options to include advanced stop bar in southbound
    direction without conflicting with SW 51st Street intersection approach).
x   Pedestrian crosswalk signs at stop bars.
x   Install downward arrow rider signs under existing pedestrian crossing warning signs. Relocate the existing
    northbound crossing sign near the relocated wheelchair ramp if the crossing is straightened.

Time:         2:00 PM to 4:00 PM

Location:     City Hall 801 SW Highway 101

Purpose:      The purpose of this meeting is to provide a brief introduction to the project and review and discuss
              existing and future baseline transportation conditions in Lincoln City (Technical Memoranda #6, #7,
              and #8). An overview of key findings will be provided and the consultant will lead a discussion of
              potential options for addressing transportation needs. A new draft of the TSP vision, goals, and
              objectives (Technical Memorandum #5) has been developed based on PAC input and will be briefly
              discussed.


I. Sign-in, Introductions, and Agenda Overview
The project team introduced the project schedule to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and noted that the
next TAC meeting would likely be in late August or early September. The TAC was asked if they would prefer
doing joint meetings with the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) in the future. Overall, the TAC felt it would help
stimulate the conversations and felt it would be a good idea.


II. Project/Process Introduction
The project team gave a brief overview of the project to the TAC. Most TAC members noted they were familiar
with the Transportation System Plan update process.


III. Revised Transportation Vision, Goals, and Objectives
The following draft vision statement was presented to the TAC. It was developed from input provided at the first
PAC meeting:

     All transportation modes flow smoothly and safely to and throughout the city, meeting the needs of
     residents, businesses, visitors, and people of all physical and financial conditions. Connectivity is improved to
     support travel within and between the pearls, where mixed-use development is complemented by enhanced
     walking and biking environments. Environmental resources are protected, right of way is used wisely, and
     healthy lifestyles are promoted.

The following goals were also developed from input at the November 13th PAC meeting.

       Goal 1: Provide for efficient motor vehicle travel to and through the city.
       Goal 2: Increase the convenience and availability of pedestrian and bicycle modes.
       Goal 3: Provide transit service and amenities that encourage a higher level of ridership.
Technical Advisory Committee Meeting #1 Summary

    Goal 4: Provide an equitable, balanced and connected multi-modal transportation system.
    Goal 5: Enhance the health and safety of residents.
    Goal 6: Foster a sustainable transportation system.
    Goal 7: Ensure the transportation system supports a prosperous and competitive economy.
    Goal 8: Coordinate with local and state agencies and transportation plans.
The project team noted that the goals are not in order of priority and are intended to provide direction for the
development of transportation system solutions.

The TAC wanted to ensure tsunami was included as an objective under one of the goals. The project team
noted it was an objective under Goal 5. The TAC questioned where a north to south arterial route adjacent to
US 101 would be. The project team suggested that it would be disconnected, with the Nelscott area, D River
Bridge, and Schooner Creek Bridges as limitations to the connection. The TAC questioned how specific street
extensions would get. The project team noted the potential alignment wouldn’t be property specific unless the
corridor was constrained.


IV. Existing and Future Baseline Transportation Conditions
The project team went over existing and future baseline (2035) transportation conditions. The city’s population
is currently 8,000, with up to 20,000 additional tourists visiting the city during the summer. Those 65 and older
make up more than 20 percent of the population, while most residents (72 percent) commute to work via single
occupant vehicles.

Today, the highest walking and biking activity generally occurs near beach access and shopping. Typically more
walking activity than biking occurs in the city. Transit service is provided via the OXO Connector accessing NW
Oregon, Rose Lodge to Newport, LINC IntraCity Loop and Dial-a-Ride Service. Few north-to-south driving
alternatives exist to US 101, which varies from 2 to 5 lanes through the city.

The TAC noted that bike riding seems low compared to similar sized cities in Oregon. They also noted that
working hours vary by person, so limited transit frequency makes transit inconvenient. It is not flexible enough
for most workers, with driving generally being a shorter trip than transit.

The TAC questioned how flooding on East Devils Lake Road impacts US 101. A TAC member noted that a
planned project for the County will raise the street 6 inches, with another long-term (unfunded) solution to
raise the street 3 to 4 feet to mitigate some of the flooding impacts. The TAC was concerned about the
flooding since this route provides the only northern bypass to US 101, and only additional highway alternative
route if the D-River Bridge is lost.

A TAC member noted that the Casino has a bus route that was not identified. They also noted that the North
by NW connector was missing from the existing inventory in Technical memorandum #6.
Technical Advisory Committee Meeting #1 Summary

Page 3 of 4
Most pedestrian and bicycle crashes occur along US 101, with 5 pedestrians hit between NW 18th to NW 15th
and 3 bicyclists hit between NW 40th and NW 39th. Three pedestrian fatalities and 1 bicycle fatality have
occurred since 2007.

The TAC noted that the high collision location near Logan Road has a median opening. The TAC noted that
biking is the city is dangerous, and that there are generally no safe biking areas. The terrain is also a
challenge.

Household growth through 2035 is expected to be highest at the north end of the city, near Roads End.
Employment growth through 2035 is expected to be highest near the Casino and at the south end of the city
near Taft. During the summer peaks of 2035, 6 signalized intersections and 7 unsignalized intersections will
experience long delays. Peak congestion will spread over multiple hours. On average weekday peaks in 2035, 2
signalized intersections and 3 unsignalized intersections will experience long delays. New growth areas will be
underserved by transit in 2035, including the Roads End area. Many sidewalk and bike lane gaps will also exist in
2035.

The TAC noted that transportation solutions should not be limited to areas within the city. System
management solutions near Highway 18 could optimize travel to and through Lincoln City.

The TAC noted that visitors in vacation rentals do not know any other route besides US 101.The TAC
questioned how the trip patterns were adjusted between these uses and full-time single family homes. The
project team noted that local property management firms were contracted to help with the adjustments.

V. Discussion of types of potential solutions
The project team went over a toolbox of potential transportation solutions with TAC members. TAC members
noted the following transportation solutions are needed:

    Improved frequency of the Lincoln City Loop                  Comprehensive way-finding system
    Improved parking for bikes and vehicles                      Transit signal priority
    Remote parking with a shuttle for special                    Shared streets for walking and biking with
     events                                                        pavement markings
    Trolley service for tourists                                 Note deficiencies in TSP for critical link bridges
    Traveler information for parking
The TAC noted that the city should consider funding a Trolley some other way besides through tax payers. The
TAC suggested having it funded by local hotels, motels and businesses. The TAC mentioned the Trolley will
note help with transportation system congestion, but will make getting around the city more convenient.

VI. Next Steps/Adjourn
The project team will develop initial evaluation criteria to provide a point-based technical rating method that
will be used to evaluate how well proposed design alternatives meet the measure of effectiveness criteria. The
project team will also begin the process of identifying transportation solutions to address the identified system

gaps and deficiencies. At our next meeting we will discuss the project evaluation criteria and initial
transportation solutions. In the meantime, please visit the project website http://www.lincolncitytsp.org and
provide comments on the draft project deliverables.

Time:         5:30 PM to 7:30 PM

Location:     City Hall 801 SW Highway 101

Purpose:      The purpose of this meeting is to review and discuss existing and future baseline transportation
              conditions in Lincoln City (Technical Memoranda #6, #7, and #8). An overview of key findings will be
              provided and the consultant will lead a discussion of potential options for addressing transportation
              needs. A new draft of the TSP vision, goals, and objectives (Technical Memorandum #5) has been
              developed based on PAC input from meeting #1 and will be briefly discussed.


I. Sign-in, Introductions, and Agenda Overview
The project team introduced the project schedule to the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) and noted that the
next PAC meeting would likely be in late August or early September. The PAC was asked what they would like
the purpose of their next meeting to be. The PAC decided that their next meeting would focus on the
development of transportation system solutions.


II. Revised Transportation Vision, Goals, and Objectives
Members of the PAC discussed the desired transportation system in Lincoln City at the first PAC meeting. The
following draft vision statement was developed from the input provided.

     All transportation modes flow smoothly and safely to and throughout the city, meeting the needs of
     residents, businesses, visitors, and people of all physical and financial conditions. Connectivity is improved to
     support travel within and between the pearls, where mixed-use development is complemented by enhanced
     walking and biking environments. Environmental resources are protected, right of way is used wisely, and
     healthy lifestyles are promoted.

The following goals were also developed from input at the November 13th PAC meeting.

       Goal 1: Provide for efficient motor vehicle travel to and through the city.
       Goal 2: Increase the convenience and availability of pedestrian and bicycle modes.
       Goal 3: Provide transit service and amenities that encourage a higher level of ridership.
       Goal 4: Provide an equitable, balanced and connected multi-modal transportation system.
       Goal 5: Enhance the health and safety of residents.
       Goal 6: Foster a sustainable transportation system.
       Goal 7: Ensure the transportation system supports a prosperous and competitive economy.

    Goal 8: Coordinate with local and state agencies and transportation plans.
The project team noted that the goals are not in order of priority and are intended to provide direction for the
development of transportation system solutions. The project team asked the PAC if they were satisfied with the
updated goals and objectives. The PAC was satisfied, with the following requested additions to the project
objectives:

    Ensure the transportation system improves air and water quality.
    Ensure that freight deliveries are accommodated.

The project team went over existing and future baseline (2035) transportation conditions. The city’s population
is currently 8,000, with up to 20,000 additional tourists visiting the city during the summer. Those 65 and older
make up more than 20 percent of the population, while most residents (72 percent) commute to work via single
occupant vehicles.

The PAC questioned how the work commute modes compared to similar cities. The project team noted that
they are similar to Newport, with walking being higher in Lincoln City and biking higher in Newport.

Today, the highest walking and biking activity generally occurs near beach access and shopping. Typically more
walking activity than biking occurs in the city. Transit service is provided via the OXO Connector accessing NW
Oregon, Rose Lodge to Newport, LINC IntraCity Loop and Dial-a-Ride Service. Few north-to-south driving
alternatives exist to US 101, which varies from 2 to 5 lanes through the city.

The PAC noted that walking is nearly impossible in Roads End today. The PAC questioned how much through
traffic travels along us 101 through Lincoln City. The project team noted it is about 10 percent northbound and
12 percent southbound.

Most pedestrian and bicycle crashes occur along US 101, with 5 pedestrians hit between NW 18th to NW 15th
and 3 bicyclists hit between NW 40th and NW 39th. Three pedestrian fatalities and 1 bicycle fatality have
occurred since 2007.

The project team noted that the existing walking and biking counts were collected on different days. PAC
members generally feel it is easier to walk than bike in Lincoln City. PAC members also feel that travel speeds
are too high along US 101. PAC members noted that more police enforcement is needed at street crossings
along US 101. They also noted that the streets look large, and make drivers feel like they can drive faster. The
PAC suggested adding visual cues to the street to encourage more people to driver slower.

Household growth through 2035 is expected to be highest at the north end of the city, near Roads End.
Employment growth through 2035 is expected to be highest near the Casino and at the south end of the city
near Taft. During the summer peaks of 2035, 6 signalized intersections and 7 unsignalized intersections will
experience long delays. Peak congestion will spread over multiple hours. On average weekday peaks in 2035, 2
signalized intersections and 3 unsignalized intersections will experience long delays. New growth areas will be

underserved by transit in 2035, including the Roads End area. Many sidewalk and bikelane gaps will also exist in
2035.

The PAC questioned what the percent of growth was between today and 2035. The project team noted that
housing is expected to increase 13 percent and employment 42 percent. The PAC was surprised that more
traffic does not utilize East Devils Lake Road. The project team noted that it was just not that attractive of a
route for through traffic. The PAC noted that the left turn to and from East Devils Lake Road is difficult.

IV. Discussion of types of potential solutions
The project team went over a toolbox of potential transportation solutions with PAC members. PAC members
noted the following transportation solutions are needed:

    Bike parking                                                 Audible crosswalks
    Sidewalks on US 101                                          Curb ramps/retrofits
    Off-street parking locations and availability                Covered transit stops
     information need to be more readily available
                                                                  Sharrows on local streets rather than signage
     (wayfinding)
                                                                  Trolley
    Environmentally friendly off-street parking
                                                                  Zoning changes to allow mixed-uses
    Handicapped parking spaces on US 101
                                                                  LED lighting
    Consistent posted speeds along US 101
                                                                  Transportation demand management with
    Traffic calming measures
                                                                   large employers
    Pedestrian countdown signals

V. Questions/Comments from Public Attendees
No questions or comments were received from non-PAC members.

VI. Next Steps/Adjourn
The project team will develop initial evaluation criteria to provide a point-based technical rating method that
will be used to evaluate how well proposed design alternatives meet the measure of effectiveness criteria. The
project team will also begin the process of identifying transportation solutions to address the identified system
gaps and deficiencies. At our next meeting we will discuss the project evaluation criteria and initial
transportation solutions. In the meantime, please visit the project website http://www.lincolncitytsp.org and
provide comments on the draft project deliverables.

The project team held an open house to solicit public
input on the draft set of recommended transportation
solutions. The event was held during the farmer’s
market and attracted approximately 15 members of the
public.

Several posters were on display, and handouts were
provided. Those in attendance were asked to mark on
posters which projects they felt should be prioritized along the US 101 corridor, and were asked to mark on the
handout which city-funded projects they felt should be prioritized with the funding anticipated to be available.
Posters presented at the open house are attached at the end of this summary.

Public Event #2 Summary

The City’s transportaƟon funding expectaƟons were presented to the public prior to starƟng the exercise. They
were told to expect about $2 million in funding over the next 20 years. However, instead of limiƟng them to a
budget of $2 million, the public was allowed to go over budget by up to $4 million, under the assumpƟon that
the remainder would need to be made up through the use of new revenue streams. With a total of $18.6 million
worth of improvements selected by the public, the average individual spent $3.1 million on improvements ($1.1
million more than budgeted).

The public was to select which highway cross-section option they preferred for implementation in the
Oceanlake Pearl (NW 21st to NW 13th).
A need to improve conditions in the Oceanlake Pearl from NW 21st to NW 13th had previously been expressed by
many members of the public. Several options for reconfiguring the use of the available right-of-way between the
existing buildings were presented for discussion. Among the comments received, every member of the public
expressed their interest in removing parking so bike lanes could be included on the highway. Two members of
the public preferred Option 3A (remove parking/curb extensions for bike lanes) and five members of the public
preferred Option 3B (remove parking/curb extensions for bike lanes and reduce lane widths to provide a center
buffer). No one expressed interest in Option 2 (remove parking/curb extensions for a center turn lane).

The Cost of Transportation                                                          Lincoln City TSP


Maintaining and operating the city street network requires most of the revenue the city is able to
generate for transportation uses. These costs will continue to increase over time, leaving fewer
dollars available for the construction of new roads, sidewalks, bike lanes, and transit service.

Over the next 20 years, Lincoln City will          Funding for Improvements: $2 million
use nearly all its transportation funding
maintain existing infrastructure.

The City can expect ODOT to fund some
improvements to state highways, the
County to fund some projects on their
roads, and developers to construct roads
with new development.                                 Lincoln City’s current transportation
                                                                revenue sources
                                                       System Development Charges   Traffic Impact Fees
                                                               Federal Highway


                                                          State Gas Tax                          Transient Room Tax




How would you spend $2 million on the city transportation
system?
You will be given a handout with all the projects on the city transportation system. These projects
can be viewed on the posters around the room. Identify the projects on the ledger (included with the
handout) that you would spend the $2 million on the city transportation system.



What if more money were available?
If the City could increase funding for transportation in the future, how would you want to spend it?

Examples of new revenue sources are:

     Transportation Utility Fee: A small ($1-$10) monthly fee included on all resident and business
     water bills (every $1 charged could raise $100,000 annually – or $2 million over 20 years)
     Local Fuel Tax: A small (1 to 5 cents per gallon), voter-approved tax applied to gasoline sales in
     the city (potential to raise $100,000 annually – or $2 million over 20 years)
     Local Improvement Districts: Voter-approved assessment on properties, paid through
     property taxes, to pay for specific projects that directly benefit those properties

If you think the city should raise additional revenue, identify your additional priorities on the project
ledger beyond the $2 million. Remember we are only focusing on the city transportation system.

Oceanlake Highway Design Options
US 101 through Oceanlake is heavily congested in the summer. Lack of turn lanes and
bike lanes, and the presence of on-street parking restricts mobility and causes conflicts          Option 3A: Remove Parking/Curb Extensions for Bike Lanes
between cars, bikes, and pedestrians. The corridor is fully occupied with no room for widening.
Any changes in Oceanlake would require removal of the on-street parking.

Do you think changes should be made to US 101 in Oceanlake? If so, which option do you prefer?

Converting the outside lanes on the highway to comfortable bike
lanes could transform Taft into a complete multi-modal environment,
encouraging more bicycle activity in the area. It would require
low-cost painting and would complement the streetscape
improvements already in place. Congestion would increase for drivers,
but this area would continue to be one of the least congested
segments of highway in the city.                                                                                                                                    Painted Buffer

Date:         Sunday, August 9, 2015

Time:         Advertised as 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM (City staff were present 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM)

Location:     Farmer’s Market at the Lincoln City Cultural Center, 540 NE Highway 101

The project team held an open house to
solicit public input on the draft
Transportation System Plan project list. The
event was held concurrently with the
farmer’s market. Not all attendees
completed a comment form or signed in for
the event, but participation is estimated to
be 45 to 50 people.

Several posters were on display and
handouts were provided. The materials
were also made available via the project
website. Those in attendance were asked
to either place a marker on the poster or fill
out a comment form, letting us know what
projects were most important to them. Posters presented at the open house are attached at the end of this
summary.

HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS
The public was asked if we included the right projects in Package 1. Package 1 includes the highest priority
projects that we believe could be funded over the next 20 years. Available funding is assumed to include
about $2.5 million in local funds and from $5 to 10 million in state funds for projects benefiting Highway 101.
The following is a summary of the changes they would like to see to Package 1:

       Four people suggested that Project T2 (Improved LINC Transit Service Hours) be included. It was
        specifically mentioned that Lincoln City needs improved transit for seniors, and better access to senior
        services outside Lincoln City. They further suggested that evening and Sunday service is needed.
       Project T5 (Improved County Transit) should be included.
       Two people suggested that Project T3 (Seasonal Trolley Feasibility Study) should be removed from
        Package 1.

Lincoln City Transportation System Plan
Public Event #3

What is the Transportation System Plan?
Lincoln City’s Transportation System Plan (TSP) will include investment and management strategies to
meet transportation needs within the city over the next 20 years. This includes recommended projects
to improve the safety, connectivity, and efficiency for driving, walking, biking, and riding transit.
Having an adopted TSP will help Lincoln City make the best use of limited resources and compete for
state and federal funding.

Transportation funding affects
It is estimated that the city will have around $2.5 million to spend on transportation projects over the
next 20 years. In addition to this, there could be as much as $5 to $10 million available from state
sources for investments that would benefit the Highway 101 corridor. However, the full TSP project list
includes more than 120 projects, totaling an estimated $254 million worth of investments.

Because funding is very limited, identifying the highest priority projects that could be constructed with
anticipated funding will be important. This is also a good time to consider if the city should explore
new revenue streams to help fund transportation improvements in the future.

So what projects are most important to you?
The Draft TSP groups projects into four packages, which are indicators of priorities.

      Package 1 includes the highest priority projects that could be funded with the $2.5 million worth
       of city funds, and $5 to $10 million in state funds that may be available.

      Packages 2 and 3 each require a new revenue stream capable of yielding another $2.5 million.

      Package 4 includes all other projects in the TSP.

The city is not required to construct projects in this order. It is simply a guide to help identify which
projects may be of highest value considering the amount of funding expected to be available. The city
can always change priorities over time as transportation needs change and opportunities arise.

The tables on the following pages provide descriptions of all projects recommended in the Draft TSP,
including estimated costs and the package in which they should be included. The project numbers in
the left hand column correspond with the projects illustrated on the maps. Please take some time to
review these and fill out a comment form, letting us know what projects are most important to you.

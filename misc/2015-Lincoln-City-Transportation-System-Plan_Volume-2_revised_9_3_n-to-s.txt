            Alternative Mobility Targets                                                             P11086-010


It is important for a Transportation System Plan (TSP) to identify a full range of transportation system projects
and services that would address the deficiencies that would exist at the end of a 20-year planning horizon if the
community grows in accordance with its existing adopted land use plan and no additional improvements are
made during that period of time.

However, it is also important for a TSP to realistically identify which transportation projects and services are
reasonably likely to be implemented over the 20-year planning horizon, based on financial or other constraints.
This exercise enables the community and, as appropriate, the state to establish realistic expectations for how
that transportation system will likely operate at the end of the 20-year planning horizon.

Because of the financial and other constraints that have been faced by state and local governments over the last
20 years and which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future, it is often the case that the local
and/or state roadways will not be improved to the extent that they will be able meet local level-of-service (LOS)
standards or, in the case of ODOT, roadway volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio based mobility targets, at the end of
the 20-year planning horizon if the community grows in accordance with its existing, adopted land use plan.
This is particularly common in larger communities or in those with roadways that experience higher travel
demands. In these cases, it is appropriate to adjust roadway performance expectations, as expressed through
local LOS standards or state mobility targets, to match the performance that is actually forecasted to exist at the
end of the 20-year planning horizon, through the adoption of alternative standards or mobility targets.

In other words, in these situations, adopting alternative standards or mobility targets is simply an exercise in
adjusting roadway performance expectations to match realistic expectations for how the roadways are actually
forecasted to operate, taking into account financial and other constraints and assuming implementation of the
existing, adopted local land use plan. In addition to establishing realistic expectations for future system
performance, this process will help reduce the potential for state and local investment needs by not continuing
to require compliance with standards or targets that both parties acknowledge cannot likely be achieved,
assuming that the community continues to grow in accordance with its existing, adopted land use plan.
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets
August 22, 2014
Page 2 of 12

In Lincoln City, the transportation system analysis has revealed that portions of US 101 are not expected to be
able to meet ODOT’s existing adopted mobility targets at the end of the 20-year planning horizon, based on the
transportation impact associated with the population and employment growth expected through
implementation of the City’s existing, adopted land use plan and the transportation system performance that
would result, assuming implementation of only those projects and services that have been identified as
reasonably likely to be funded during the 20-year planning horizon. This memorandum documents the need for
developing alternative mobility targets for US 101 through Lincoln City and describes the proposed new targets.
Included is a summary of the methodology and results, and the recommended alternative mobility targets for
the highway.

Background
The segment of US 101 under
consideration, shown in Figure
1, is bounded by the urban
growth boundary (near Clancy
Road to the north and near SW
63rd Street to the south). US 101
is the major transportation
route through Lincoln City,
running north to south bisecting
the city. The Pacific Ocean, Siletz
Bay, Devils Lake, D River, and
hilly topography- limit
continuous north to south
routes parallel to US 101. At
several locations, US 101 is the
only north-south street, forcing
most drivers to use it for trips
within the city.

Within Lincoln City, US 101 is
classified as a Statewide
Highway. Statewide Highways
typically provide inter-urban
and inter-regional mobility and
provide connections to larger
urban areas, ports, and major        Figure 1: US 101 Segment Under Consideration for Alternative Mobility Targets
recreation areas that are not
directly served by Interstate Highways. A secondary function is to provide connections for intra-urban and intra-
regional trips. The management objective is to provide safe and efficient, high-speed, continuous-flow
operation. In addition, US 101 through Lincoln City is part of the National Highway System and Strategic
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets

National Defense Highway Network (STRAHNET), and is a designated Federal truck route, Scenic Byway, and a
Tier 1 Lifeline Route.

A portion of US 101 within the Taft district (475 feet north of SW Fleet Avenue to 250 feet south of SW/SE 51st
Street) also has a Special Transportation Area (STA) designation. The primary objective of a STA is to provide
access to and circulation amongst community activities, businesses, and residences and to accommodate
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit movement along and across the highway. Although motor vehicle traffic moves
through an STA and automobiles may play an important role in accessing an STA, convenience of movement
within an STA focuses upon pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes. It encourages direct street connections and
shared on-street parking. Local auto, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit movements to the area are generally as
important as the through movement of traffic. Because of this, ODOT’s mobility targets and design standards in
STA’s are intended to allow for lower speed operations.

The Need for Alternative Mobility Targets
Prior to exploring alternatives to the current mobility targets, evaluation of the disparity between the current
targets and forecasted traffic operations confirmed the need for assessing the potential to mitigate conditions
through other means. The findings of that evaluation are described below.

Existing and Future Highway Operations
A comparison of existing (year 2012) and future (year 2035) traffic operations along US 101 to adopted mobility
targets during summer traffic conditions (30 HV) shows that most intersections operate well today, but traffic
demand in the summer p.m. peak period at many intersections will exceed capacity by 2035. Table 2
summarizes the results of this analysis, along with both the Highway Design Manual (HDM) and existing OHP
Mobility Targets. Typically, the Highway Design Manual mobility standard is applied to the evaluation of highway
construction improvements and the existing OHP Mobility Targets are used in the assessment of development
proposals and planning projects. As shown, most of the intersections would fail to comply with both standards
by 2035.

The Transportation System Plan (TSP) development process considered a range of improvement options for US
101. This included widening the highway corridor to add capacity, making spot improvements at intersections,
enhancing the transit system, expanding the cycling and walking networks, strategies to help manage peak
travel demands, and improvements to maximize the efficiency of the existing street network. Widening the
highway to five lanes through the city would add a significant amount of capacity and would allow nearly all
intersections to comply with current mobility targets. However, the impact to existing development would be
significant considering the surrounding environment and constrained right-of-way (both built environment and
physical constraints). Additionally, the cost of such widening (in total or for any segment that currently does not
have five lanes) is well beyond any reasonably likely expectation for funding during the 20-year based on current
ODOT funding capabilities. Therefore, the highway-widening improvements were not recommended for
implementation within the 20-year planning horizon.

Widening US 101 to a uniform five-lane cross-section will be identified as a possibility for the timeframe beyond
the 20-year planning horizon, with the benefits, costs, and constraints duly noted. If strong a community
interest in pursuing highway widening develops and significant (currently unanticipated) funding to implement
widening of one or more highway segments during the current 20-year planning horizon is secured, ODOT will
work with the City to amend the TSP and highway performance expectations accordingly. Absent that
development, ODOT and the City will manage US 101 with the expectation that no highway widening projects
will be developed during the 20-year planning horizon. Without highway widening, the management approach
for US 101 is to maximize the safety and efficiency of the overall transportation system and increase accessibility
and availability of transit, walking and biking facilities, recognizing that it is not currently financially feasible or
practical from either a community impact or physical constraint perspective (or both) to construct additional
highway capacity on US 101 to reduce congestion.

Table 2 shows how US 101 intersections are expected to operate in 2035 during the summer peak with the
recommended improvements from the Lincoln City TSP in place. Congestion on the highway is not expected to
significantly improve over the “No Build” condition, with peak hour demand near or exceeding capacity at most
signalized intersections. Given that highway widening would be required to meet existing OHP Mobility Targets,
it is clear that it will not be possible to meet them along US 101 in Lincoln City by the end of the 20-year
planning horizon.

Factors Limiting the Ability to Meet Existing Mobility Targets
Several factors combine to make compliance with the current mobility targets along US 101 difficult. They
include:

       Competition from Multiple Users
        The importance of US 101 to statewide, regional, and local traffic creates significant demands for both
        short and long trips along the corridor. These competing users include:

           Motorists making local trips to homes, work, and shopping
           Motorists making regional trips through Lincoln City between other cities along the coast
           Freight traveling to and through Lincoln City (US 101 is a Federal Truck Route)
           Tourists driving along the coast, many with large recreational vehicles, and stopping in Lincoln City
            to shop, dine, and enjoy the attractions
           Transit, including movement and access – most of the local transit routes are along US 101
           Bicyclists- US 101 is a major touring bike route as well as a means of transportation for locals
           Pedestrians using the most direct route, in some places the only route, connecting their residences
            with community facilities, employment, and shopping

       Financial Factors
        As is true for most agencies, funding for City and ODOT transportation improvements is limited. Even if
        all forecasted state and local transportation revenue for projects in Lincoln City over the next 20 years
        were spent on highway capacity improvements, it would still fall well short of enabling current mobility
        targets to be met (and would likely be insufficient to widen even one of the existing non-five lane
        segments).

       Existing Development Patterns
        In many areas along US 101, adjacent development constrains the ability to widen the highway right-of-
        way. Obtaining needed right-of-way for highway widening would require acquisition and removal of
        such development, which would be very expensive and undesirable to the community.

       Environmental Factors
        The Pacific Ocean, Siletz Bay, Devils Lake, D River, and hilly topography (particularly at Spanish Head)
        limits options to provide an effective, connected transportation system, especially along US 101, which
        is the primary transportation corridor through the city. These factors provide a challenging environment
        for transportation and make the construction or expansion of transportation facilities potentially cost
        prohibitive.

Other Strategies Being Applied to Enhance Mobility
Recognizing that mobility along US 101 will be constrained, the City’s Transportation System Plan includes
several actions to help relieve congestion:

       Improvements to local streets to allow the city street network to operate at a Level of Service “E” or
        better through the year 2035. Maintaining good performance of the local streets will help to provide
        attractive travel alternatives to US 101 for local trips, where practical.
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets
August 22, 2014
Page 7 of 12

       Expand the city’s local street network, especially in the north and southeast parts of the city, to improve
        connectivity and create alternate routes to US 101 for local trips, removing them from the highway.

       Use an array of Transportation System Management (TSM) strategies, including adaptive signal timing
        on US 101 (currently being implemented), displaying traveler information at city gateways, improved
        connectivity of local streets, and improved parking management for visitors (in addition to access
        management regulations already in place).

       Enhance the transit system to improve services and provide attractive travel options as funding allows.
        This includes upgrading transit stop accessibility and amenities, working to secure funding to implement
        a seasonal trolley service, expanding LINC service hours, implementing park and ride facilities, and
        coordinating with Lincoln County to improve county-funded transit service.

       Fill facility gaps in the pedestrian and bicycle network and improve crossing opportunities along US 101,
        improving safety and providing access to major activity generators.

However, even with these actions in place, traffic operations along US 101 will not meet existing OHP Mobility
Targets at the end of the 20-year planning horizon. The implementation of these actions, along with the OTC
adoption of alternative mobility targets for US 101 into the OHP that reflect ODOT and the City’s mutual,
realistic highway performance expectations, constitutes ODOT’s US 101 management strategy in Lincoln City
through the 20-year planning horizon.

Proposed Alternative Mobility Targets
The approach to developing alternative mobility targets for US 101 through Lincoln City included the following:

       The replacement of the 30th highest annual hour of traffic analysis time period with the average annual
        weekday peak hour.

       New maximum v/c ratio thresholds that reflect ODOT and City US 101 highway performance
        expectations based on the expected growth associated with implementation of the City’s existing
        adopted land use plan, regional US 101 traffic growth, and state and local transportation facility and
        service improvements that have been identified and reasonably likely to be implemented during the 20-
        year planning horizon with identified funding constraints.

This section describes the proposed alternative mobility targets in detail, including the process used to develop
them and the associated analysis methodology.

Applying the Average Annual Weekday Peak Hour
One characteristic of the current mobility target that makes it difficult to comply with through Lincoln City is the
requirement to use the 30th highest annual hour of traffic as the design period. In many larger urbanized areas,
this time period is roughly equivalent to the average weekday p.m. peak hour at virtually any time during the
year. However, along the Oregon Coast, and in this area in particular, US 101 also serves significant seasonal
demand from recreational trips. Therefore, the 30th highest annual hour of traffic occurs on a summer Friday
evening, when local commuting traffic peaks coincide with recreational traffic peaks. Because it will not be
Technical Memorandum—Alternative Mobility Targets
August 22, 2014
Page 8 of 12

possible to meet, or even stay below actual facility one-hour capacity using ODOT’s standard analysis
methodology during the 30th highest hour, the approach to establish a new mobility target for US 101 through
Lincoln City begins with using a design period that is more representative of travel that does not take place
during the peak summer tourist season.

Figure 2 illustrates the
difference in traffic volumes on
US 101 during an average
weekday compared to the
summer peak (30 HV). During
an average weekday (typically
during late May and early
September), volumes are
generally 20 percent lower
than those along the highway
during the summer. In fact, for
at least eight months out of
the year, traffic volumes are
often well below the annual
average.
                                             Figure 2: Summer volumes on US 101 in Lincoln City are generally 20
                                           percent higher than those along the highway during an average weekday
Since the average annual
weekday p.m. peak hour is more representative of travel on US 101 through Lincoln City for the majority of any
given year than the 30th highest annual hour, this time period is recommended for the analysis methodology
used to develop the US 101 alternative mobility target(s). This would shift the corridor management emphasis
away from accommodating summer recreational trips through the city and refocus it on conditions that are
more representative of every day travel. Furthermore, the 20 percent allowance for additional traffic that could
result from using that time period negates the roughly 30 percent disparity between the current targets and
projected operations in the future.

Assigning New Maximum v/c Ratio Thresholds
As noted above, using the average annual weekday p.m. peak hour as the basis for defining facility performance
instead of the 30th highest annual hour is more consistent with the conditions that exist on US 101 throughout
the majority of any given year. However, even with this methodology adjustment, several intersections still
exceed the OHP v/c ratio values that apply to US 101.

The OHP v/c ratio thresholds for US 101 in Lincoln City range from 0.80 to 0.95. Raising the v/c ratio threshold in
order to match the forecasted roadway performance based on the implementation of the City’s existing,
adopted land use plan and implementation of the identified financially constrained projects along the corridor is
also needed in several areas, in addition to changing the analysis time period as described above.

Alternative Mobility Target Process
Figure 3 shows the ODOT Region 2 methodology for determining
alternative mobility targets. Table 3 summaries the assessment
of each study intersection along US 101 using the methodology.
Refer to Technical Memorandum #8 (Future Transportation
Conditions) for summer and average weekday 2035 p.m. peak
hour motor vehicle volumes used for this methodology.

Step 1: Eight of the twenty-four study intersections (but only
two of the twelve signalized intersections) would be expected to
meet existing OHP mobility targets during the summer of 2035,
after recommended improvements described earlier. To be
compliant, Lincoln City would need alternative mobility targets
for 16 of the twenty-four study intersections.

Step 2: Of the 16 study intersections that would not meet
current mobility targets during the summer of 2035, four (all
signalized) would be expected to operate with v/c ratios less
than 1.0.

Step 3: Of the 12 study intersections expected to operate with a
v/c ratio over 1.0 during the summer of 2035, two would be
expected to operate with v/c ratios less than 1.0 after assuming
a peak hour factor of 1.0.1

Step 4: Of the 10 study intersections expected to operate with a
v/c ratio over 1.0 during the summer of 2035 after assuming a
1.0 peak hour factor, only two (signalized intersection of US
101/SW 32nd Street and unsignalized intersection of US 101/SE        Figure 3: Alternative Mobility Target Methodology
14th Street) would be expected to also operate with a v/c ratio over 1.0 during an average weekday in 2035.

Step 5: Technical Memorandum #10 (Transportation System Solutions) documents the analysis referred to as
“hours of congestion.” The analysis applied to the soon to be signalized SW 32nd Street intersection, shows the
intersection will exceed capacity for approximately eight consecutive hours during an average weekday in 2035.
The hours of congestion analysis was not reviewed for the unsignalized US 101/SE 14th Street intersection
because the over-capacity condition was related to high delays experienced by a small number of projected
vehicles attempting to turn out of the side street onto US 101. It is likely that under such conditions, these
drivers will avoid the area and reroute to the nearest signalized intersection.

1
 Peak hour factors (PHF) are used to account for the non-uniformity of traffic flow within the peak hour by converting hourly volumes to
peak flow rates associated with a selected interval of time within the peak hour. The most common interval of time selected for traffic
analysis is the peak 15 minutes. A PHF of 1.0 assumes uniform traffic flow within the four 15-minutes periods of the peak hour.

August 22, 2014
Page 11 of 12

Recommended Alternative Mobility Targets
Because the newly signalized intersection at US 101 and 32nd is the only signalized intersection that is forecasted
to exceed the existing OHP Mobility Target values once the analysis methodology is adjusted to assess the
average annual condition, it is the only existing adopted OHP target value that requires an alternative mobility
standard (the intersection at US 101 and NE 22nd also exceeds the adopted target value, but only by 0.01, so it
does not merit any adjustment). In this location, an alternative OHP Mobility Target v/c ratio of 1.0 (an “at full
capacity” condition) for 8 hours per average weekday is recommended for adoption by the Oregon
Transportation Commission (OTC). OTC adoption of the alternative analysis methodology that assesses the
average annual weekday traffic conditions is also recommended for all of US 101 in Lincoln City.

A number of unsignalized intersections on US 101 are also expected to operate above the existing OHP Mobility
Target values at the end of the 20-year planning horizon. The segment where these conditions are expected
runs from the intersection of US 101 and NE Holmes Rd to the intersection of US 101 and SE 29th Street. In this
segment, an alternative OHP Mobility Target v/c ratio of 0.95 for the major street approaches at these
intersections is recommended for adoption by the Oregon Transportation Commission (OTC).

As previously noted, the minor approach at US 101 and SE 14th Street was also forecasted to have demands that
would exceed capacity for multiple hours per average weekday. However, because this forecasted over-
capacity condition is related to high delays experienced by a very small number of vehicles attempting to turn
out of the side street, an alternative OHP Mobility Target for these minor street movements (turns from the
local street onto US 101) is not recommended. It is likely that under such conditions, the few drivers that were
theoretically assigned to use this intersection through the analysis process will, in reality, avoid this intersection
during peak travel periods and reroute to the nearby signalized intersection at US 101 and 12th Street (meaning
that the forecasted operating condition is likely overstated).

US 101 Operations under the Recommended Alternative Mobility Targets
Table 4 compares US 101 traffic operations under the average weekday peak hour to the previously reported
30th highest annual hour. It shows that most intersections would be able to comply with either the existing,
adopted OHP Mobility Targets or the alternative OHP Mobility Targets that are recommended for OTC adoption
through 2035 with implementation of transportation projects identified in the Lincoln City TSP.

FROM:         Darci Rudzinski and Shayna Rehberg, Angelo Planning Group

SUBJECT:      Lincoln City Transportation System Plan (TSP) Update
              Revised Proposed Policy and Code Amendments (Task 6.2)


This memorandum presents draft policy and code amendments for implementing the updated City
of Lincoln City Transportation System Plan (TSP). The proposed amendments in subsequent
sections of this memorandum are based primarily on the following sources:

   x   Draft 2015 Lincoln City Transportation System Plan, TSP Goals;

   x   Recommendations from the 2012 Lincoln City Walking and Biking Plan;

   x   Discussion at Project Management Team (PMT) Meeting #5 (June 25, 2014);

   x   Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) requirements; and

   x   The code and other City documents, particularly the City’s draft update of its Transportation
       System Plan (TSP).

City Planning Commission and City Council will review the draft amendments;. a revised set of
proposed amendments will be considered during the public adoption hearings for the updated TSP.

Transportation Goals and Policies

 The TSP update proposes a new set of transportation policies to include in Lincoln City’s
Comprehensive Plan. The new policies are based on the goals and objectives in the draft TSP. The
Project Management Team (PMT) and the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) have vetted the
policies, which reflect recommendations in the 2012 Lincoln City Walking and Biking Plan, as well
as issues raised at PMT Meeting #5 (June 25, 2014).

Table 1 presents draft policy language. The right-hand column provides the source of the draft
policy language and other information that helps explain the proposed language. This commentary
column indicates the numbered objective from the draft TSP as well as any changes made since June
25, 2014.1 Note that many policies expand and implement the corresponding TSP objective and do
not mirror TSP language exactly; proposed language is intended to provide policy guidance for land
use and transportation decision making after the TSP is adopted.

The formatting of Table 1 numbers each goal; policy numbering reflects the associated goal for easy
reference.

Proposed Policy                                             Commentary

Goal 1: An equitable, balanced and connected multi-modal transportation system.

    Policy 1.1:    Ensure that the transportation system                     Objective 1a
                   provides equitable access to all modes and to
                   underserved and vulnerable populations.

    Policy 1.2:    Ensure that the transportation system is age-             Objective 1a
                   friendly.

    Policy 1.3:    Enhance system efficiency with new or         Objective 4c
                   improved transportation connections that give

Development Code
The following section presents draft proposed amendments to Lincoln City Municipal Code
(LCMC) Title 12 (Streets, Sidewalks and Public Places), Title 16 (Subdivisions), and Title 17
(Zoning). These amendments have been developed in response to the following:

   x   Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) requirements;

   x   Recommendations from the 2012 Lincoln City Walking and Biking Plan;

   x   Discussion at Project Management Team (PMT) Meeting #5 (June 25, 2014); and

   x   Consistency between the code and other City documents, particularly the City’s
       Transportation System Plan (TSP).

The draft amendments are presented in adoption-ready format, although the amendments will
undergo one final round of revisions before an adoption draft is prepared for the first evidentiary
hearing before the Planning Commission. Adoption-ready format means that proposed additions are
underlined and proposed deletions are struck-through. The proposed amendments are organized
sequentially by code section.

Commentary precedes each section of the code that briefly explains the proposed amendment and
includes references to the recommendations from the Code Amendments Recommendations
memorandum (July 7, 2014). The summary recommendation table from that memorandum is
included in this memorandum as Attachment A. In some cases, multiples sets of proposed
amendments apply to a single code section, accompanied by sequential commentary.

Commentary #1:

Consistent with a City request and proposed Policy 4.4, proposed requirements address minimum
clear dimensions for sidewalks.

12.04.070 Unobstructed sidewalks.

Property owners and utility providers shall keep a minimum of five feet of the sidewalk width clear of
both permanent and temporary obstructions (e.g., utility poles, sandwich signs).



Commentary #2:

The provisions in LCMC Chapter 12.28 (Vehicle Access and Circulation) currently apply to a
segment of US 101 and its approach roads. However, the provisions in this chapter are consistent
with Model Development Code for Small Cities (“model code”), require coordination with ODOT
as needed, and grant discretion to the City for implementing the stricter of the provisions (e.g., joint
or cross access, turn restrictions) when appropriate. Due to the flexibility of the existing provisions,
they can readily be expanded to apply citywide. It is recommended that minor changes be made to
these provisions to enable them to apply citywide, as there are not such regulations for vehicle
access and circulation in the city currently. In applying citywide, it is recommended that the chapter
be struck and added as a new section in LCMC Chapter 17.52 (Supplemental Regulations), shown
later in this memorandum (after Commentary #7).

                                 VEHICULAR ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

12.28.200 Vehicular access and circulation.

A. Intent and Purpose. The intent of this section is to manage access to land uses and on-site circulation,
and to preserve the transportation system in terms of safety, capacity, and function while providing
reasonable access for residents and businesses.

B. Applicability. This chapter applies to Highway 101 between SE/SW 12th Street and SE/SW 37th Street,
to all properties that abut the Highway, and to all properties within 200 feet of the Highway that abut
streets intersecting with the Highway. The standards apply when lots are created, consolidated, or
modified through a land division, partition, lot line adjustment, lot consolidation, or street vacation; and
when properties are subject to land use approval or site plan review. The requirements in this chapter
are in addition to requirements relating to properties abutting Highway 101 that are imposed by the
Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) through the provisions of Oregon Administrative Rule
734-051. Where ODOT requires more restrictive provisions than city requirements, ODOT standards
shall prevail.

C. Access Permit Required. Access to Highway 101 (e.g., a new curb cut or driveway approach) requires
an access permit from Lincoln City and a valid approach road permit from the Oregon Department of
Transportation. Access to the intersecting streets identified in subsection (B) of this section also requires
an access permit from the city. An access permit may be in the form of a letter to the applicant, or it
may be attached to a land use decision notice as a condition of approval.

D. Notice to ODOT. Written notice of the following actions shall be provided to ODOT by Lincoln City.
Said notice shall be provided when Lincoln City provides notice to other public agencies and city
departments. When notice to other public agencies and city departments is not provided, Lincoln City
shall provide written notice to ODOT at the same time and manner as public notice is provided to the
general public.

      1. Land use applications that require public hearings;

      2. Subdivision and partition applications;

      3. Other applications that affect private access to Highway 101 or the intersecting streets
      identified in subsection (B) of this section.

E. Traffic Study Requirements. The city may require a traffic impact study prepared by a qualified
professional. ODOT may require such a study for properties abutting Highway 101. The city and ODOT
will use the traffic impact study to make decisions about access, circulation, and other transportation
requirements. It is the intent of the city to coordinate its traffic impact study requirements with ODOT

                                                                                    August 4, 2015
                                                                                          Page 16



so that an applicant need complete only one such study to comply with the requirements of both
agencies.

F. Conditions of Approval. The city may require the closing or consolidation of existing curb cuts or other
vehicle access points, recording of reciprocal access easements (e.g., for shared driveways), turn
restrictions, development of a frontage street, installation of traffic control devices, and/or other
mitigation as a condition of granting an access permit, to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the
street and highway system. Installation of traffic control devices on Highway 101 must be approved by
ODOT.

G. Corner and Intersection Separation – Backing onto Public Streets. New and modified accesses shall
conform to the following standards:

      1. Property access to Highway 101 is under the concurrent jurisdiction of the Oregon Department
      of Transportation (ODOT). Access to streets intersecting with the highway shall not be permitted
      within 100 feet of the intersection unless no other reasonable access to the property is available.
      Where no other alternatives exist, the city may allow construction of an access connection at a
      point less than 100 feet from such an intersection, provided the access is as far away from the
      intersection as possible. In such cases, the city may impose turning restrictions (i.e., right in/out,
      right in only, or right out only). Access to properties with frontage on Highway 101 and other
      public roads shall be provided only from the roads other than the highway whenever reasonable
      access can be provided.

      2. Access to and from off-street parking areas shall not permit backing onto a public street, except
      for single-family dwellings.

      3. The city may reduce required separation distance of access points to city streets where they
      prove impractical due to lot dimensions, existing development, other physical features, or
      conflicting code requirements, provided all of the following requirements are met. Where the
      statewide highway access point spacing requirements in OAR 734-051 cannot be met, all the
      following requirements must be met before the city can complete the “Land Use Compatibility
      Statement for a State Highway Approach” required for a highway approach road application.

           a. Joint-use driveways and cross-access easements are provided in accordance with
           subsection (I) of this section;

           b. The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this
           section; and

           c. The property owner(s) enter in a written agreement with the city, recorded with the deed,
           that pre-existing connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of
           each side of the joint-use driveway.

                                                                                     August 4, 2015
                                                                                           Page 17



H. Site Circulation. New developments shall be required to provide a circulation system that
accommodates expected traffic on the site. Pedestrian connections on the site, including connections
through large sites, and connections between sites (as applicable) and adjacent sidewalks, must be
sufficient to safely accommodate expected pedestrian traffic to, from, within, and across the site.

I. Joint- and Cross-Access – Requirement. The number of driveway and private street intersections with
public streets should be minimized by the use of shared driveways for adjoining lots where feasible.
When necessary for traffic safety and access management purposes, or to access flag lots, the city
and/or ODOT (for access to Highway 101) may require joint access and/or shared driveways in the
following situations:

      1. For shared parking areas;

      2. For adjacent developments, where access onto an arterial or collector is proposed;

      3. For multitenant developments, and developments on multiple lots or parcels. For such joint
      accesses and shared driveways the city may require the applicant to incorporate any of the
      following, among other requirements:

           a. A continuous service drive or cross-access corridor that provides for driveway separation
           consistent with the applicable transportation authority’s access management classification
           system and standards;

           b. A design speed of 10 miles per hour and a maximum width of 24 feet, in addition to any
           parking alongside the driveway; additional driveway width or fire lanes may be approved
           when necessary to accommodate specific types of service vehicles, loading vehicles, or
           emergency service provider vehicles;

           c. Driveway stubs to property lines (for future extension) and other design features to make
           it easy to see that the abutting properties may be required with future development to
           connect to the cross-access driveway;

J. Joint- and Cross-Access – Reduction in Required Parking Allowed. When a shared driveway is provided
or required as a condition of approval, the land uses adjacent to the shared driveway may have their
minimum parking standards reduced in accordance with the shared parking provisions of
LCMC 17.56.060.

K. Joint- and Cross-Access – Easement and Use and Maintenance Agreement. Pursuant to this section,
property owners shall:

      1. Record an easement with the deed allowing cross-access to and from other properties served
      by the joint-use driveways and cross-access or service drive;

                                                                                   August 4, 2015
                                                                                         Page 18



      2. Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the roadway for the
      subject property shall be dedicated to the city and pre-existing driveways will be closed and
      eliminated after construction of the joint-use driveway;

      3. Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of
      property owners.

L. Access Connections and Driveway Design. All driveway connections to a public right-of-way (access)
and driveways shall conform to all of the following design standards:

      1. Driveways to city streets shall meet the following standards:

           a. One-way driveways (one-way in or out) shall have a minimum driveway width of 10 feet,
           and a maximum width of 12 feet, and shall have appropriate signage designating the
           driveway as a one-way connection.

           b. For two-way access, each lane shall have a minimum width of 10 feet and a maximum
           width of 12 feet.

      Driveways to Highway 101 shall meet ODOT requirements for design and construction.

      2. Driveways shall be designed and located to provide exiting vehicles with an unobstructed view
      of other vehicles and pedestrians, and to prevent vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on
      the public street or causing conflicts with on-site circulation. Construction of driveway accesses
      along acceleration or deceleration lanes or tapers should be avoided due to the potential for
      vehicular conflicts. Driveways should be located to allow for safe maneuvering in and around
      loading areas.

      3. Driveway aprons (when required) shall be constructed of concrete and shall be installed
      between the street right-of-way and the private drive, as shown in Figure 12.28.200A. Driveway
      aprons shall conform to ADA requirements for sidewalks and walkways, which generally require a
      continuous unobstructed route of travel that is not less than three feet in width, with a cross slope
      not exceeding two percent, and providing for landing areas and ramps at intersections.

M. Fire Access and Turnarounds. When required under the Uniform Fire Code, fire access lanes with
turnarounds shall be provided. Except as waived in writing by the fire marshal, a fire equipment access
drive shall be provided for any portion of an exterior wall of the first story of a building that is located
more than 150 feet from an existing public street or approved fire equipment access drive. The drive
shall contain unobstructed adequate aisle width (14 to 20 feet) and turn-around area for emergency
vehicles. The fire marshal may require that fire lanes be marked as “No Stopping/No Parking.”

N. Vertical Clearances. Driveways, private streets, aisles, turn-around areas and ramps shall have a
minimum vertical clearance of 13 feet and six inches for their entire length and width.

O. Clear Vision Areas. No visual obstruction (e.g., sign, structure, solid fence, or shrub vegetation) may
be placed in a clear vision area except in accordance with LCMC 17.52.060. The minimum clear vision
area may be modified by the city engineer with the concurrence of the planning director upon finding
that more or less sight distance is required (i.e., due to traffic speeds, roadway alignment, etc.). ODOT
shall establish clear vision requirements for Highway 101, but if the city’s clear vision requirements are

P. Construction. The following development and maintenance standards shall apply to all driveways and
private streets, except that the standards do not apply to driveways serving one single-family detached
dwelling. For properties abutting Highway 101, development and maintenance requirements
established as a part of an ODOT approach road permit also shall apply.

      1. Surface Options. Driveways, parking areas, aisles, and turnarounds may be paved with asphalt,
      concrete, or comparable surfacing, or a durable nonpaving or porous paving material may be used
      to reduce surface water runoff and protect water quality. Driveway and street materials shall be
      subject to review and approval by the city engineer.

      2. Surface Water Management. When nonporous paving is used, all driveways, parking areas,
      aisles, and turnarounds shall have on-site collection of surface waters to eliminate sheet flow of
      such waters onto public rights-of-way and abutting property. Surface water facilities shall be
      constructed in conformance with applicable engineering standards.

      3. Driveway Aprons. When driveway approaches or “aprons” are required to connect driveways to
      the public right-of-way, they shall be paved with concrete surfacing and conform to the city’s
      engineering design criteria and standard specifications. (See general illustrations in Figure
      12.28.200A.)



Commentary #3:

Proposed amendments update existing subdivision block size requirements to make them consistent
with access spacing standards established in the TSP.

Proposed modifications amend existing subdivision provisions to make pedestrian/bicycle access
ways a requirement instead of a discretionary decision by the Planning Commission. The following
proposed language provides exceptions and design specifications.

Per Recommendation 10, a reference to local street design standards in the TSP has been added in
subdivision street standards, and the minimum right-of-way and roadway table has been replaced
with this reference. A reference to the public works/engineering standards should be added if the
street design standards will be incorporated into that document.

The amendments propose deletion of language pertaining to “other sidewalks” not being required of
the subdivider or partitioner. Off-site transportation improvements, including sidewalks, may be a
condition of approval, based on the findings of the transportation impact analysis. (See
recommendation 6c in Attachment A.)

                                           DESIGN STANDARDS

16.12.170 Block sizes.

Blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length, except blocks adjacent to arterial streets or Block sizes shall
conform to the access spacing standards in the city Transportation System Plan unless the previous
adjacent layout or topographical conditions justify a variation. The recommended minimum distance
between intersections on major streets is 1,800 feet.

16.12.200 Easements – Pedestrian and bicycle access ways.

When the planning commission determines pedestrian ways to be essential for public convenience, such
ways may be required to connect two culs-de-sac between streets in long blocks between streets and
other public or semipublic lands or through major or minor greenway systems. In any block over 750
feet in length, a pedestrian way with a minimum width of eight feet or combination pedestrian way and
utility easement may be required through the middle of the block. If unusual conditions require blocks
longer than 1,200 feet, two pedestrian ways may be required. Long blocks parallel to arterial streets
may be approved without pedestrian ways if desirable in the interests of traffic safety.

A. Where applicable, pedestrian and bicycle access ways shall be provided to achieve the following
connections, as generally illustrated in the Figure 16.12.200A:

      1. from the head of a cul-de-sac to the nearest street, including cases where the nearest street is a
      segment of the same street leading to the head of the cul-de-sac where the street consists of tight
      curves;

      2. between streets on either side of a long block (more than 750 feet in length), with at least one
      access way for every 750 feet in block length;

      3. from or between other existing or approved pedestrian and bicycle access ways; and

      4. other connections as determined necessary by the planning commission.

Commentary #4:

Proposed amendments require pedestrian/bicycle access ways in subdivisions and define access way
in LCMC Chapter 17.08. (See Recommendation 6c in Attachment A.)

Proposed language also adds on-site and site-to-site pedestrian/bicycle circulation and access
requirements for uses other than commercial uses; and includes a definition for these pedestrian and
bicycle circulation and access facilities (pathways) in LCMC Chapter 17.08. (See Recommendations
6a and 6b in Attachment A.)

New definitions in 17.08 define shared streets and shared-use paths. (See Recommendation 13b in
Attachment A.)

The amendments permit transportation uses addressed in the TPR outright in the base zones in
LCMC 17.16-17.45 and add a definition for “transportation uses” is in LCMC Chapter 17.08. (See
Recommendation 1 in Attachment A.)

“Access” means the way or means by which pedestrians and vehicles enter and leave property.

”Access way” means a pedestrian and/or bicycle connection between two rights-of-way, or to achieve
other connectivity needs as determined by the planning commission. An access way conforms to city
standards and is in either an off-street public right-of-way or a public access easement on private
property.

“Accessory structure” or “accessory use” means a structure or use incidental and subordinate to the
main use of property and located on the same lot as the main use, including any required off-street
parking within 200 feet (measured in a straight line) of the building or use it is intended to serve.

[…]

“Owner” means the person in whom is vested the ownership, dominion or title of property; proprietor;
including an authorized agent of the owner.

”Pathway” means a pedestrian and/or bicycle way on private property that provides pedestrian and/or
bicycle circulation within a site and to adjacent sites and facilities.

“Perennial” means a landscape plant that persists for several years with new herbaceous growth from a
part that lives over from one growing season to another.

“Screening” means the visual shielding of one structure or use from another structure or use by fences,
walls, berms, or densely planted vegetation so as, on installation, to substantially, but not necessarily
totally, eliminate visual impacts of the shielded structure or use on the other structure or use.

“Shared street” means a low-volume and low-speed street, as designated in the city Transportation
System Plan, used by pedestrians, bicyclists, and motor vehicles, and where pedestrians have priority
over motor vehicles and bicyclists. Shared streets do not have clear division between pedestrian and
motor vehicle space (e.g., no continuous curb) and typically include such features as street furniture
(e.g., planters, street trees, benches) and areas for social interaction. Design criteria for shared streets
are included in the Transportation System Plan.

”Shared-use path” means a facility for non-motorized travel outside of the roadway, intended for
transportation and recreation or both. Typical design standards for shared-use paths are in the city
Transportation System Plan.

“Shoreline” means the boundary line between a body of water and land, measured on tidal waters at
mean high water, and on non-tidal waterways at the ordinary high water mark.

[...]

“Transitional area” means an area consisting of a lot, lots or parts of lots, within any residential district,
having side lot lines abutting a boundary of a commercial or industrial zone, and extending not more
than 100 feet from such boundary into the residential zone.

“Transportation uses” means transportation facilities, services, and improvements as identified in the
Transportation Planning Rule, OAR 660-012-0045(1), including:

        x   Operation, maintenance, and repair of existing transportation facilities identified in the city
            Transportation System Plan;

        x   Dedication of right-of-way, authorization of construction, and the construction of facilities and
            improvements, where the improvements are consistent with clear and objective dimensional
            standards; and

        x   Changes in the frequency of transit, rail, and airport services.

“Underlying zone” means the existing zone on the property at the time of application.

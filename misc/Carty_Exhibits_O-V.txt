  O.1      INTRODUCTION

  OAR 345-021-0010(1)(o) Information about anticipated water use during construction and
  operation of the proposed facility.

  Response: This exhibit provides details regarding uses of water, the source of water used, and the
  avenues of water loss and output from the Carty Generating Station. OAR 345-021-
  0010(1)(o)(D) is satisfied by Figure O-1­ Water Mass Balance Average Annual Conditions and
  Figure O-2 ­ Water Mass Balance Summer Condition. OAR 345-021-0010(1)(o)(E) applies
  only if the proposed facility would not need a groundwater permit, a surface water permit, or a
  water right transfer; since the Carty Generating Station would need a secondary use permit,
  Subsection E is not applicable. Information regarding the secondary use permit can be found in
  Section O.5. Mitigation measures for adverse impacts of water use are presented in O.6.

  Portland General Electric Company (PGE) anticipates using approximately 10,000,000 gallons
  of water from Carty Reservoir during construction of each block (total of 20,000,000 gallons of
  water). During operation the Carty Generating Station, under annual average conditions, would
  use approximately 2,300 gallons per minute (gpm) from the Carty Reservoir and approximately 1
  gpm from an existing well. Water would be withdrawn from Carty Reservoir under a secondary
  use permit. Potential adverse impacts related to water use would be mitigated by reusing
  wastewater from the Carty Generating Station internally and by operating Carty Reservoir at a
  slightly higher elevation during the winter months than current operation, but well under the
  maximum pool elevation level.



O.2        Water Uses and Sources

  operation of the proposed facility.

  OAR 345-021-0010(1)(o)(B) A description of each source of water and the applicant's estimate
  of the amount of water the facility will need during construction and during operation from each
  source under annual average and worst-case conditions.

  Response:

  O.2.1 Construction

  During construction, water would be used for dust abatement, washing equipment and vehicles,
  washing concrete trucks after delivery of concrete loads, fire suppression during construction,
  and water supply for testing and commissioning. PGE anticipates using approximately
  10,000,000 gallons during the construction period for each block (total of 20,000,000 gallons of

  Exhibit O                                                                                 Final 2011
water). A majority of the water would be used in the later phases of construction to support
commissioning activities.

All non-potable water used for construction activities would be obtained from Carty Reservoir.
Temporary pumps and piping may be required to support initial construction activities until the
permanent pumps and piping are installed. Carty Reservoir has a maximum surface area of
approximately 1,450 acres and contains approximately 38,000 acre feet of water (12 billion
gallons) at a maximum pool elevation of 677 feet above mean sea level (MSL). The average
pool elevation for the reservoir since 1990 has been approximately 667 to 668 feet above MSL.
At this elevation, the reservoir surface area is approximately 1,100 acres and contains
approximately 26,000 acre feet of water (8.5 billion gallons). An Oregon Water Resources
Department secondary use permit application (for general industrial use) for use of the existing
water rights held by PGE (Certificates of Water Right Nos. 86056 and 86057) is included in this
ASC as Appendix O-2 ­ Application for a Permit to Use Surface Water and was directly
submitted to the Oregon Water Resources Department. This category allows for use of water for
construction purposes. This water right is sufficient for all water needs during construction of
the proposed Carty Generating Station.

Potable water would be obtained from a temporary tie in with the Boardman Plant potable water
system or hauled in from nearby potable water systems. Boardman Plant potable water is
obtained from an existing well located 750 feet northwest of the existing Boardman Plant.
Potable water would be required for items such as ice machines, coolers, and sinks for
construction facilities to support construction personnel.

O.2.2 Operation

The primary uses of water during operation of the Carty Generating Station would be steam
generation and cooling tower makeup water. Water would also be used for demineralized water
production, potable water, service water, and fire water tank supply. Figures O-1 and O-2
provide the water mass balance for average annual and summer conditions (worst case).
Average annual conditions are the average annual temperature and humidity for the site based on
the nearest recording weather station. There are not necessarily a certain numbers of days when
this average temperature would occur; rather, the average of the temperatures for the entire year
will be equally this temperature. As used in the preliminary Application for Site Certificate,
summer conditions, which are the worst case for water use, are the American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 1% warm season temperature. It is anticipated
that worst case conditions would prevail for no more than 1% of the days per year.

Using average annual conditions without duct firing provides for the best estimate of the total
water usage. More water than indicated in the average annual case would be used when it is
hotter and the unit is at base load or the unit is at base load plus some amount of duct firing.
Less water would be used when it is cooler or when the unit is run at less than base load or is off
line for routine scheduled maintenance.


Application for Site Certificate            O-2                               Carty Generating Station
Exhibit O                                                                                  Final 2011
The proposed locations of pipelines to transport water to the Carty Generating station are shown
on Figure B-5 in Exhibit B. A description of the existing and proposed water supply
infrastructure is also provided in Section B.4, subsection Interconnection Water Pipelines. Since
existing intake and discharge structures would be used, there would be no construction along the
shoreline of Carty Reservoir.

Potable water would be obtained from the existing Boardman potable water system, which
obtains its water from an existing well located 750 feet northwest of the existing Boardman
Plant. All other operational uses of water would use raw water from Carty Reservoir. Table
O.2-1 provides the anticipated amount of water the Carty Generating Station would need during
operation from each source under annual average and summer conditions. Anticipated water use
and water loss, presented in Tables O.2-1 and O.3-1, were derived from Figures O-1 and O-2.
Gallons per minute from Figures O-1 and O-2 are rounded in the tables. The original unrounded
numbers from Figures O-1 and O-2 were multiplied by a conversion of 1,440 minutes per day
and then rounded to produce the gallons per day values in the tables. Since the gallons per
minute and the gallons per day in the table both start with the unrounded numbers from the
figures, multiplying the gallons per minute in the table by 1,440 minutes per day will not result
in the same gallons per day presented in the table. In any event, the rounding or un-rounding
does not have a material impact on the analysis.

The gallon per day usage estimate for potable water and sanitary systems is dependent on the
number of permanent staff and will vary from 800 to 1,440 gallons per day.

Water from Carty Reservoir is also used for irrigation by Three Mile Canyon Farms. Reservoir
Permit No. R-6276 includes an addendum to PGE's Reservoir Permit Application No. R-51520,
which outlines the planned use of Carty Reservoir for irrigation. The addendum states that the
maximum pool elevation allows for a 10-foot drawdown for irrigation, resulting in a storage
capacity of approximately 11,000 acre-feet for irrigation. Water is withdrawn from Carty

Reservoir by Three Mile Canyon Farms in accordance with a water right permit issued by the
Oregon Water Resources Department (WRD) (Permit No. S-41645). The water right permit, as
amended, authorizes use of Carty Reservoir water on up to 6,833.7 acres. The specific
acreage/location of use allowed under the water right is specified in a Final Order issued by
WRD on February 28, 2001 (Special Order v. 55, p. 212). Copies of the permits and
amendments noted above are available in Appendix O-1.



O.3      Water Losses

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(o)(C) A description of each avenue of water loss or output from the
facility site for the uses described in (A), the applicant's estimate of the amount of water in each
avenue under annual average and worst-case conditions and the final disposition of all
wastewater

Response: Permanent water losses at the Carty Generating Station would occur primarily as
evaporative loss from cooling tower evaporation and drift, combustion turbine evaporative
cooling (seasonal), evaporation from the lined evaporation ponds (if they are constructed as a
wastewater disposal option), non-recoverable losses from the heat recovery steam generator
(HRSG) and discharge of sanitary sewage. Losses attributed to miscellaneous plant drains,
combustion turbine evaporative cooler blowdown, cooling tower blowdown, mixed bed spent
chemical regenerant, and media filter backwash would be sent back to Carty Reservoir or to on-
site lined evaporation ponds. Exhibit V provides additional information regarding process water
handling options. Water losses that may be recovered would be reused within the facility as
well. These include HRSG blowdown and blowdown quench water and reject water from the
reverse osmosis treatment equipment. These losses would be recovered and used as makeup to
the cooling tower. Table O.3-1 provides the anticipated amount of water losses at the Carty
Generating Station during operation under annual average and summer conditions.

O.4      Secondary Use Permit

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(o)(F) If the proposed facility would need a groundwater permit, a
surface water permit or a water right transfer, information to support a determination by the
Council that the Water Resources Department should issue the permit or transfer of a water use,
including information in the form required by the Water Resources Department under OAR
Chapter 690, Divisions 310 and 380.

Response: PGE has an existing water use permit for storage in Carty Reservoir. PGE has
provided the information necessary to support a determination by the Energy Facility Siting
Council that the WRD should issue a secondary water right permit authorizing the use of stored
water from Carty Reservoir at the Carty Generating Station in Appendix O-2 ­ Application for a
Permit to Use Surface Water; this application has also been directly submitted, with fees, to the
WRD. In addition, PGE has changed the use of water under the existing water right Certificates
86056 and 86057 from the specific industrial use of "thermal power generation facility" to
general industrial use. Appendix O-3 contains a letter from the Oregon WRD to Martha Pagel of
Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt regarding the Oregon WRD's acceptance of the change in water
use.



O.5      Mitigation

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(o)(G) A description of proposed actions to mitigate the adverse impacts
of water use on affected resources.

Response: Generally, potential adverse impacts related to water use could include impacts to
recreation if the water was taken from a recreational water source or transported across a
recreational or environmentally sensitive area; impacts to surrounding domestic or irrigation
wells if significant amounts of water were withdrawn from groundwater; and impacts to local
service providers to supply water to users. All non-potable water required for Carty Generating
Station construction and operation would be supplied from the Carty Reservoir under a WRD
secondary use permit and the volume of water required for the Carty Generating Station would
not require an increase in the existing permitted reservoir volume. In addition, the Carty
Reservoir is not used for recreation and is located immediately adjacent to the Carty Generating
Station, so there would be no impacts to recreation or from the transportation of water across
recreational areas or environmentally sensitive areas. Water stored within the Carty Reservoir is
not used by local service providers and therefore water use would not affect service providers'
ability to provide water to their users. Water from the reservoir is also used for irrigation;
however, the existing permitted reservoir volume is sufficient to meet the volume requirements
of the irrigation, Boardman Plant and Carty Generating Station uses. The Carty Generating
Station would also reuse water internally, which would further reduce potential impacts. There
are no adverse impacts on affected resources identified; therefore PGE is not proposing any
mitigation measures.

P.1      INTRODUCTION

OAR 345-021-0010(1)(p) Information about the fish and wildlife habitat and the fish and
wildlife species, other than the species addressed in subsection OAR 345-02100010(1)(q), that
could be affected by the proposed facility, providing evidence to support a finding by the Council
as required by OAR 345-022-0060.

OAR 345-022-0060 To issue a site certificate, the Council must find that the design,
construction, and operation of the facility, taking into account mitigation, are consistent with the
fish and wildlife habitat mitigation goals and standards of OAR 635-415-0025, in effect as of
September 1, 2000.

Response: Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) goals and standards to mitigate
impacts to fish and wildlife habitat caused by land and water development actions are
incorporated under OAR 635-415-0000 through OAR 635-415-0025. The Energy Facility Siting
Council (EFSC) requires compliance with these habitat mitigation rules; this exhibit addresses
the requirements of these rules.

This exhibit addresses potentially affected fish and wildlife habitat and species. An associated
wildlife and habitat mitigation and restoration plan will be submitted separately.



P.2      SUMMARY

This exhibit identifies eight wildlife habitat types and 13 state sensitive and/or federal species of
concern (collectively referred to as "sensitive" species), which are known to occur or potentially
occur within the project analysis area. Species identified as federal and/or state listed threatened,
endangered, or candidate species are discussed in Exhibit Q. One species without sensitive
status, but given special consideration under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and
Golden Eagle Protection Act, is also identified. The project analysis area for evaluating fish and
wildlife habitat included the following area during the 2009 study period: (1) approximately
5,490 acres, consisting of the 4,090-acre 2009 Energy Facility Survey Area, which will
encompass the Carty Generating Station, and a 1,400-acre transmission line right-of-way (ROW)
located west of the Energy Facility Survey Area and (2) raptor nest surveys were conducted
within the Energy Facility Survey Area and an additional 1-mile buffer around the proposed site
boundary and the 18-mile long transmission line corridor boundary (Figure P-1). In the context
of this analysis, "raptor nest" means any nest site for birds of prey, such as eagles, ospreys,
hawks, falcons, and owls. The project analysis area during the 2010 study period included
approximately 2,817 acres, consisting of the 1,000-acre 2010 Energy Facility Survey Area, the
1,400 acre Transmission Line Survey Area, and the additional 417 acres of the 2010 Ground
Squirrel Survey Area that extended outside the site boundary.

Exhibit P                                                                                   Final 2011
For discussion purposes, this document occasionally distinguishes between the analysis area for
the power plant and the analysis area for the transmission line. The power plant analysis area
includes the plant footprint (including access roads), laydown area, switchyard, and evaporation
ponds, as well as surrounding areas within the Site Boundary that are not within the transmission
line corridor and is referred to as the Energy Facility Survey Area. Figure P-1 presents the
survey areas. Figure P-2 presents observations within the Energy Facility Survey Area. The
analysis area for the proposed transmission line includes the existing power line corridor that
extends from the Energy Facility Survey Area to the Slatt substation. Figures P-2 and P-3
present observations within the transmission corridor.

To avoid significant potential impacts of construction, operation, and maintenance on sensitive
or otherwise important wildlife species, Portland General Electric Company (PGE) proposes to
monitor for potential raptor nest sites within 1 mile of the project (2 miles of the Energy Facility
Site) prior to construction and implement avoidance actions as necessary. To minimize
significant potential impacts to wildlife habitat, the following mitigation measures are proposed:
(1) use of best management practices (BMPs) and erosion and sediment control techniques to
minimize impacts to water quality and wetlands; (2) placement of transmission towers outside
wetlands to the extent practical; (3) use of existing roads for construction and maintenance of the
transmission line to the greatest extent practical; (4) re-seeding areas of unavoidable soil
disturbance and implementing a revegetation plan that includes monitoring and established
success criteria (details in Appendix P-4); and (5) implementing appropriate actions to prevent
spills and waste materials from entering waterways or wetlands.



P.3      FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS

The fish and wildlife habitat mitigation recommendations described in OAR 635-415-0025
prioritize fish and wildlife habitats. OAR 635-415-0025 defines six habitat categories and
establishes mitigation goals and recommendations for each category. The six habitat categories
and corresponding mitigation goals and recommendations are described below:

"Habitat Category 1" is irreplaceable, essential habitat for a fish or wildlife species, population,
or a unique assemblage of species and is limited on either a physiographic province or site-
specific basis, depending on the individual species, population or unique assemblage. The
mitigation goal for Category 1 habitat is no loss of either habitat quantity or quality. ODFW
recommends or requires avoidance of impacts to Category 1 habitat through alternatives to the
proposed development action or no authorization of the proposed development action if impacts
cannot be avoided.

"Habitat Category 2" is essential habitat for a fish or wildlife species, population, or unique
assemblage of species and is limited either on a physiographic province or site-specific basis
depending on the individual species, population, or unique assemblage. The mitigation goal, if
impacts are unavoidable, is no net loss of either habitat quantity or quality and to provide a net

benefit of habitat quantity or quality. ODFW recommends or requires avoidance of impacts to
Category 2 habitat through alternatives to the proposed development action; or mitigation of
impacts, if unavoidable, through reliable in-kind, in-proximity habitat mitigation to achieve no
net loss of either pre-development habitat quantity or quality. In addition, a net benefit of habitat
quantity or quality must be provided. Progress towards achieving the mitigation goals and
standards shall be reported on a schedule agreed to in the mitigation plan performance measures.
The fish and wildlife mitigation measures shall be implemented and completed either prior to or
concurrent with the development action. If neither avoidance of impacts nor mitigation can be
achieved, ODFW shall recommend against or shall not authorize the proposed development
action.

"Habitat Category 3" is essential habitat for fish and wildlife, or important habitat for fish and
wildlife that is limited either on a physiographic province or site-specific basis, depending on the
individual species or population. The mitigation goal is no net loss of either habitat quantity or
quality. ODFW recommends or requires avoidance of impacts to Category 3 habitat through
alternatives to the proposed development action, or mitigation of impacts, if unavoidable,
through reliable in-kind, in-proximity habitat mitigation to achieve no net loss in either pre-
development habitat quantity or quality. Progress towards achieving the mitigation goals and
standards shall be reported on a schedule agreed to in the mitigation plan performance measures.
The fish and wildlife mitigation measures shall be implemented and completed either prior to or
concurrent with the development action. If neither avoidance of impacts nor mitigation can be
achieved, ODFW shall recommend against or shall not authorize the proposed development
action.

"Habitat Category 4" is important habitat for fish and wildlife species. The mitigation goal is no
net loss in either existing habitat quantity or quality. ODFW recommends or requires avoidance
of impacts to Category 4 habitat through alternatives to the proposed development action; or
mitigation of impacts, if unavoidable, through reliable in-kind or out-of-kind, in-proximity or
off-proximity habitat mitigation to achieve no net loss in either pre-development habitat quantity
or quality. Progress towards achieving the mitigation goals and standards shall be reported on a
schedule agreed to in the mitigation plan performance measures. The fish and wildlife
mitigation measures shall be implemented and completed either prior to or concurrent with the
development action. If neither avoidance of impacts nor mitigation can be achieved, ODFW
shall recommend against or shall not authorize the proposed development action.

"Habitat Category 5" is habitat for fish and wildlife having high potential to become either
essential or important habitat. The mitigation goal, if impacts are unavoidable, is to provide a
net benefit in habitat quantity or quality. ODFW recommends or requires avoidance of impacts
to Category 5 habitat through alternatives to the proposed development action, or mitigation of
impacts, if unavoidable, through actions that contribute to essential or important habitat. If
neither avoidance of impacts nor mitigation can be achieved, ODFW shall recommend against or
shall not authorize the proposed development action.

"Habitat Category 6" is habitat that has low potential to become essential or important habitat for
fish and wildlife. The mitigation goal is to minimize impacts. ODFW recommends or requires
actions that minimize direct habitat loss and avoid impacts to off-site habitat.



P.4      DESCRIPTION OF BIOLOGICAL AND BOTANICAL SURVEYS PERFORMED

OAR 345-21-0010(1)(p)(A) A description of biological and botanical surveys performed that
support the information in this exhibit, including a discussion of the timing and scope of each
survey.

Response: Representatives from the ODFW, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Oregon
Department of Agriculture (ODA), and the Oregon Department of Natural Heritage Information
Center (ORNHIC) were consulted informally by PGE at the outset of the investigation. During
consultations, PGE requested data for specific information about important habitats and
threatened and endangered and other sensitive species within and in the vicinity of the proposed
Energy Facility Site and transmission line ROW. Existing literature and scientific data were also
reviewed to determine species range and habitat requirements. Ongoing consultation with
ODFW and USFWS has been conducted during the field surveys and preparation of the
supporting documents, which are available as appendices to Exhibits P and Q.

P.4.1 Survey Methods

The following is a description of the methods used to survey and map habitat, vegetation,
wetlands, and wildlife.

Habitat

Aerial photos, GAP analysis data, and on-site field truthing were used to map habitat within the
Energy Facility Survey Area and Transmission Line Survey Area. A habitat classification
system (vegetation cover types) was developed for the overall project analysis area using the
following procedures. Habitat types within the Energy Facility Survey Area and Transmission
Line Survey Area were validated during field surveys conducted in May and June of 2009 and
May of 2010. Habitat was surveyed within the project analysis area by walking transects on foot
and from a vehicle where accessible. Habitat was characterized according to dominant
vegetation and overall condition of the vegetation community, and included consideration of
surrounding land uses. Habitat types were then digitized, using aerial photos and field collected
data, into a geographic information systems (GIS) database. The GIS database was then used to
produce habitat maps and acreage estimates for each habitat type.

Each habitat type was assigned to a specific category based on the ODFW fish and wildlife
habitat mitigation goals and standards defined in OAR 635-415-0025. The habitat categories
resulting from this investigation are identified in Table P-1.

Exhibit P                                                                                  Final 2011
Vegetation

ORNHIC provided a list of threatened, endangered and candidate plant species that potentially
occur within the analysis area (ORNHIC 2009) (Figure P-4). ORNHIC furnished a list of known
locations of listed and sensitive plant occurrences within a 5-mile radius of the proposed project.
This information and a review of the current habitats within the project analysis area were used
to develop a list of target species for field surveys. Sensitive plant surveys were conducted
concurrently with Washington ground squirrel (Spermophilus washingtoni) transect surveys,
wetland and stream surveys, and general habitat characterization in May and June 2009 by
experienced botanists familiar with listed and candidate species. Habitat specific sensitive plant
species surveys were conducted in areas where suitable conditions existed to support any of the
target sensitive plant species. No sensitive plant species were observed in the project analysis
area.

Wetlands

See Exhibit J for a complete description of the wetland information review and field survey
methodology.

Wildlife

USFWS, ODFW, and ORNHIC provided information on threatened, endangered, and sensitive
fish and wildlife species known to occur or potentially to occur in the vicinity of the proposed
project (ORNHIC 2009) (Appendices Q-1 and Q-2, Exhibit Q). ORNHIC also identified several
other species of importance for this investigation that do not have formal status as threatened,
endangered, or sensitive species (Figure P-6).

Field surveys were conducted in the project analysis area by qualified wildlife biologists during
the spring and summer of 2009 (May 4­June 26) and spring of 2010 (May 4­May 28). Ground
surveys were conducted over the entire analysis area in 2009 for sensitive species, avian species,
and raptor nests. Ground surveys in 2010 were conducted in the 2010 Ground Squirrel Survey
Area and the 2010 Energy Facility Survey Area (Figure P-1). Surveys were conducted on foot
and by vehicle where access was possible. Survey protocols were developed in coordination
with ODFW. Field biologists documented all wildlife observed in the analysis area, and
recorded all sensitive species and wildlife breeding sites using a Global Positioning System
(GPS) unit.

Sensitive Species Surveys
Surveys for sensitive species known to occur or potentially to occur within the analysis area were
conducted by qualified wildlife biologists. At the request of ODFW, sensitive species surveys
focused on the Washington ground squirrel, which is currently considered a candidate species for
listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by the USFWS and is a state-listed endangered
species under the Oregon Endangered Species Act of 1987. Visual and aural surveys for the
other sensitive species potentially occurring in the analysis area were conducted concurrently

with the Washington ground squirrel surveys. Sensitive species identified during other wildlife
surveys also were recorded. Surveys for Washington ground squirrels were conducted on May
4­9 and June 22­26 in 2009 and on May 4­28 in 2010. Further details of the Washington
ground squirrel survey results are available in the 2010 Biological Field Survey Report for the
Carty Generating Station (Appendix P-2) and in Exhibit Q. At locations where the project
analysis area overlapped potential occurrence areas of sensitive species, as identified through
review of the ORNHIC database, the boundaries of the 2009 survey area were expanded an
additional 1,000 feet from the potential occurrence area. In areas where potential Washington
ground squirrel habitat occurred, qualified wildlife biologists walked transects spaced 50 meters
apart looking for burrows, fresh scat, or individual Washington ground squirrels and listened for
auditory calls. The 2010 surveys for Washington ground squirrels were conducted in locations
according to the 2009 survey results (Appendix P-2 contains a detailed discussion of the 2010
survey area, and is the area shown in Figure P-1). Surveys for other sensitive wildlife species
outside of Washington ground squirrel habitat were conducted on foot and by vehicle, where
access was possible. Appendix P-2 2010 Biological Field Survey Report, Appendix B contains a
copy of the work plan used to conducted field surveys.

Avian Species and Raptor Nest Surveys
Ground surveys for avian species and raptor nests occurring within the analysis area were
conducted concurrently with Washington ground squirrel surveys on May 5­8 and June 22­25,
2009 and May 4­28 in 2010. The 2009 surveys, focusing on raptors and sensitive species, were
conducted within the project area and within an additional 1-mile buffer around the Site
Boundary. All bird species seen or observed during the course of the surveys were recorded.

Biologists experienced in bird identification used high-powered optics to perform surveys on
foot and in a four-wheel drive vehicle. The biologists examined the entire project area in 2009;
however, efforts were intensified in areas where suitable raptor nesting substrates (i.e., trees,
rock ledges, cavities, and power line poles) occurred. All raptor nests and individual birds were
documented with a GPS unit and standardized data form, noting bird behavior and nest
characteristics. Photographs of the nests were taken to help illustrate nest shape, condition, and
substrate. Common Raven (Corvus corax) nests also were recorded because some raptor species
use established nests interchangeably with Common Ravens from year to year. This appears to
be the case for the nest located in an existing transmission line tower approximately 0.75 miles
east of the Slatt substation. This nest has been documented by ODFW as a historic golden eagle
nest and although during 2009 it was occupied by ravens, it may have been used by golden
eagles as recent as 2005.

PGE plans to conduct aerial raptor nest surveys by two experienced avian ecologists, along with
a pilot experienced in wildlife surveys, encompassing a 2-mile radius of the Energy Facility Site
and 1-mile radius of the transmission line ROW between April 15 and June 15, 2011. Aerial
nest surveys will be conducted for all raptor nests within 0.5 miles of the Site Boundary. The
survey will be extended to areas of suitable Golden Eagle nesting habitat extending 2 miles from
the Site Boundary. All raptor nests encountered during surveys of suitable golden eagle habitat

will be documented. Recommendations provided in the Interim Golden Eagle Inventory and
Monitoring Protocols (Pagel et al. 2010) for aerial surveys will be followed (i.e., minimal
hovering no longer than 30 seconds, no closer than 20 meters from a cliff/nest site). The
inclusion of aerial surveys in addition to the ground effort will increase the rate of detection that
would be achieved by using only one of these methods. Nests recorded in 2009 will be revisited
to determine their activity level and species of occupancy. New nests documented during aerial
surveys will be recorded in the same manner as nests were documented during ground efforts. A
laser rangefinder will allow surveyors to record nest coordinates from a distance, minimizing
disturbance. . If a nest's location makes it difficult to confirm species identity, the nest will later
be ground-truthed.



P.5      IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITATS
         IN THE ANALYSIS AREA

OAR 345-21-0010(1)(p)(B) Identification of all fish and wildlife habitat in the analysis area,
classified by the habitat categories as set forth in OAR 635-415-0025 and a description of the
characteristics and condition of that habitat in the analysis area.

Response: The eastern portion of the project area contains shrub-steppe habitat, agriculture
cropland, and some riparian areas and wetlands. Approximately one-fifth of this area in the
eastern portion, including the Boardman conservation area, was burned by a fire that occurred in
2008. Areas of the shrub-steppe that were not impacted by fire are dominated by big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentate), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Sandberg bluegrass
(Poa secunda), cheat grass (Bromus tectorum), and rabbit brush (Chrysothamnus sp.). The
western portion of this area consists of irrigated agriculture crops and a riparian zone with mixed
upland and water tolerant plants. Wetland areas are dominated by Russian olive Elaeagnus
angustifolia, Pacific willow (Salix lasiandra), Canada goldenrod (Solidago Canadensis) and
Amaranth (Amaranth sp.). Table P-1 lists ODFW habitat categories associated with habitats
found within the project analysis area. Table P-2 lists approximate acreages of each habitat
category temporarily or permanently affected. Table P-3 lists sensitive species observed or
having the potential to occur within the project analysis area. Figures P-2 and P-3 show habitat
types and categories found on site and detailed field observations are provided in Appendices P-1
and P-2, which contain the 2009 and 2010 Biological Survey Reports for the Carty Generating
Station.


P.5.1 Category 1 Habitat Description

Upland ­ Shrub-Steppe (Washington Ground Squirrel)

Category 1 designations are made for habitat that is considered "irreplaceable, essential, and
limited" and includes any habitat containing active Washington ground squirrel burrows and
active raptor nest sites. By applying a 785-foot buffer to the Washington ground squirrel

observations recorded during 2010 surveys, in addition to data collected by The Nature
Conservancy in 2009, an area was designated Category 1 where the Washington ground squirrel
occurs. This area consists of approximately 90 acres within the Site Boundary. A modification
to the standard 785-foot buffer was made where Tower Road crosses within the buffer at 630 feet
from an occupied squirrel burrow. In consultation with ODFW, it was determined that Tower
Road presents a significant boundary and therefore limits the southwest extent of the buffer for
that burrow to the edge of the road. The Carty Energy Facility Site would not impact Category 1
habitat. This habitat category type was not found in the transmission line survey area.

P.5.2 Category 2 Habitat Description

Upland ­ Shrub-Steppe (Potential Washington Ground Squirrel)

Category 2 habitats were identified within the project analysis area. The area is defined as
habitat adjacent to a Washington ground squirrel colony, but not occupied by any squirrels either
for burrowing or foraging, which is of a habitat type and quality similar to the area occupied by
the squirrels. A 785-foot buffer was placed around point locations of historically active
Washington ground squirrel burrows recorded over the past 8 years. This area has the highest
potential to provide habitat for squirrels. Approximately 16 acres of Category 2 habitat is within
the Site Boundary. The Carty Energy Generating Project would not impact Category 2 habitat.
This habitat category type was not found in the transmission line survey area.

P.5.3 Category 3 Habitat Description

Perennial Stream (Willow Creek)

Category 3 perennial/intermittent stream habitat is generally defined as essential habitat for fish
and wildlife, or important habitat for fish and wildlife that is limited either on a physiographic
province or site-specific basis, depending on the individual species or population. The Willow
watershed is reported habitat for the ODFW listed vulnerable inland Columbia redband trout.
Willow Creek is a perennial stream located within this watershed. The proposed transmission
line ROW would cross Willow Creek. No poles or equipment would be placed within the creek,
and equipment vehicles would cross using an existing bridge. Impacts to Willow Creek and the
Columbia redband trout would be avoided.

Wetlands

Three classes of wetlands were observed in the project analysis area: palustrine forested,
palustrine scrub-shrub, and palustrine emergent. Four wetlands were located within the Energy
Facility Survey Area; 2.2 acres of palustrine forested, 0.5 acres of palustrine scrub-shrub, and 0.2
acre of palustrine emergent. Impacts to wetlands within the Energy Facility Survey Area would
be avoided. No sensitive plant or wildlife species were observed in these habitats during field
surveys.

The analysis area for the proposed transmission line includes two palustrine emergent wetlands
comprising approximately 1.1 acres. Clearing of the ROW and construction of the transmission
line is not expected to affect these wetlands. Clearing and construction activities would be
conducted along existing roads where possible, new roads would avoid wetlands, and towers for
the transmission line would be placed outside the wetlands. Wetlands are addressed in detail in
Exhibit J.

P.5.4 Category 4 Habitat Description

Category 4 habitats include a variety of intermittent streams, and developed/disturbed mixed
with shrub-steppe and agricultural cropland. Though many of these habitats display evidence of
previous disturbance, most are important habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species.
Species observed in these habitats during field surveys include Red-tailed Hawk, coyote,
Burrowing Owl, nesting Long-billed Curlew, Golden Eagle nest, Mule deer, western rattlesnake,
western fence lizard, and white-tailed jackrabbit.

Shrub-steppe

Category 4 shrub-steppe habitat is composed of existing transmission line and dirt access road
with portions of agricultural cropland and weed dominated shrub-steppe, and a paved access
road. Areas of this habitat type may be important to some wildlife species, but it is not
considered limited. Approximately 884 acres of this habitat type is located in the Transmission
Line Survey Area. The Energy Facility Survey Area includes approximately 420 acres of

Category 4 disturbed habitat. Installation of lattice transmission towers and line stringing would
temporarily impact approximately 82 acres and permanently impact less than approximately 0.1
acres (3300 square feet) of this habitat type. New access roads would permanently impact
approximately 1 acre and temporary impact 32 acres of this habitat type. For the Energy Facility
Site, impacts from building structures, evaporation ponds, the Grassland Switchyard, and
construction areas total approximately 40 acres of temporary impact, and approximately 90 acres
of permanent impact would occur to Category 4 habitat. Mitigation for impacts to Category 4
would be conducted according to ODFW standards; details are included in Appendix P-3.


Intermittent Streams

Category 4 intermittent/ephemeral streams include the Sixmile Canyon and Eightmile Canyon
Drainages. Eightmile Canyon Creek is a highly disturbed (due to livestock grazing) ephemeral
drainage located along the transmission line ROW and west of Willow Creek. An existing
crossing would be used for Eightmile Canyon Creek, and the Rhea Road bridge would be used to
cross Willow Creek. Sixmile Canyon drainage is located within the Energy Facility Survey
Area. This feature appears to have been artificially altered and is crossed by an existing access
road. Equipment would not be installed in these areas, and vehicles would cross during the dry
season; therefore, impacts would be avoided. No sensitive plant or wildlife species were
observed in these habitats.

P.5.5 Category 5 Habitat Description

No Category 5 habitats were identified within the project analysis area.

P.5.6 Category 6 Habitat Description

There are two types of Category 6 habitat in the project analysis area: agricultural cropland and
agriculture/weedy shrub ROW. No sensitive species are known or expected to occur in the
Category 6 agriculture cropland. Observations of two raptor species and a raptor nest that was
occupied by a Corvid were identified in the Category 6 agriculture/weedy shrub ROW habitat.

Agricultural Cropland and Agriculture/Weedy Shrub ROW

Category 6 agriculture cropland and agriculture/weedy shrub ROW habitat is composed of
existing transmission line and dirt access roads, with portions of agricultural cropland and weed
dominated shrub-steppe. Areas of this habitat type may be important to some wildlife species,
but this habitat is not considered limited. Approximately 444 acres of agriculture cropland
habitat is located in the Energy Facility Survey Area. The Transmission Line Survey Area
encompasses approximately 429 acres of agricultural/weedy shrub ROW. Construction and
operation of the Carty Generating Station are not expected to affect this habitat type, although
installation of lattice transmission towers, line stringing, and new access roads would temporarily

No sensitive species were observed in this habitat type.

P.7      IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL STATE SENSITIVE SPECIES PRESENT
         IN THE ANALYSIS AREA AND DISCUSSION OF SITE-SPECIFIC ISSUES

OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(D) Based on consultation with ODFW and appropriate field study
and literature review, identification of all State Sensitive Species that might be present in the
analysis area and a discussion of any site-specific issues of concern to ODFW.

Response: Based on consultations with ODFW, USFWS, and ORNHIC, a Draft Biological
Survey Work Plan was prepared and submitted to ODFW in April 2009 to address the potential
for threatened, endangered, or sensitive species to occur within the project analysis area.
Nineteen threatened, endangered, or sensitive species were identified. Of these 19, 13 are listed
as state sensitive or federal species of concern (Table P-3). The six federal and state threatened
or endangered species are addressed in Exhibit Q.



P.8      DESCRIPTION OF BASELINE SURVEYS OF STATE SENSITIVE SPECIES

OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(E) A baseline survey of the use of habitat in the analysis area by
species identified in OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(D) performed according to a protocol approved
by the Department and ODFW.

Response: At the request of ODFW, sensitive species surveys focused on the Washington
ground squirrel, which is currently considered a candidate species for listing under the ESA by
the USFWS and is a state listed endangered species under the Oregon Endangered Species Act of
1987. Ground surveys for avian species, raptor nests, and other sensitive wildlife species
occurring within the analysis area were conducted concurrently with Washington ground squirrel
surveys in May and June 2009 and May 2010. Raptor and avian surveys are described in P.4.1 ­
Survey Methods. Washington ground squirrel surveys are described in Exhibit Q.

Sage-grouse have been extirpated from the area, and there are no active leks within the project
analysis area (Schultz 2009a); therefore, site-specific surveys for this species were not
conducted. No sage-grouse were observed during 2009 or 2010 surveys.

Raptor Nest Habitat

Two raptor nests were documented on the western side of Carty Reservoir within one-half mile
south of the proposed Energy Facility Site. The nests included an active Red-tailed Hawk nest
on a transmission tower and an active Great Horned Owl stick nest in a tree (Figure P-2). Four
nests were observed in the vicinity of the transmission line ROW. The nests included a
Burrowing Owl colony active in 2009, two stick nests in transmission towers that were occupied
by Common Raven in 2010, and an inactive stick nest on a rocky ledge. Additionally, an
artificial Osprey nesting platform is present on the central western shore of Carty Reservoir. It
was not actively being used for nesting during 2009 or 2010. Burrowing Owls are designated as
a state sensitive species by ODFW. The Burrowing Owl colony is located approximately one-

quarter mile north of the proposed transmission line (Figure P-3). No evidence of occupation
was observed during 2010 surveys, despite several visits. One of the Common Raven nests was
located in a transmission tower at the west end of the project area (Figure P-3). This nest has
been historically occupied by Golden Eagles (Cherry 2009). Raptor species documented in the
project analysis area included the American Kestrel, Golden Eagle, Northern Harrier, Prairie
Falcon, Red-tailed Hawk, Osprey, Great Horned Owl, and Swainson's Hawk, a sensitive species,
but no evidence of breeding was observed for any of these species, other than the active Great
Horned Owl and Red-tailed Hawk nests described above.

The Ferruginous Hawk, a sensitive species, was identified by the ORNHIC as occurring within 5
miles of the proposed transmission line, but was not observed in the analysis area during field
surveys.

PGE has performed raptor surveys annually for the past 13 years (1997­2009) in and near the
Project area (PGE 2010). These surveys were conducted primarily in the vicinity of the Carty
Reservoir and the Boardman Plant. Nineteen species of raptors have been documented,
including four sensitive species (Swainson's Hawk, Ferruginous Hawk, Burrowing Owl, and
Bald Eagle). PGE has observed several raptor species nesting in or near Carty Reservoir and
the Boardman Plant, including Swainson's Hawk, Osprey, Burrowing Owl, Red-tailed Hawk,
and Great Horned Owl.

Sensitive Species

Sensitive species observed during 2009 and 2010 field surveys within the transmission line
survey area included the Swainson's Hawk, Golden Eagle, Long-billed Curlew, and Burrowing
Owl. Several occurrences of Long-Billed Curlews were documented within the analysis area
during field surveys concentrated in two specific areas. A breeding pair with at least one
fledgling was observed in the area north of the Boardman Plant along the northern edge of the
2009 project survey area in habitat designated Category 1 for the Washington ground squirrel
(Figure P-2). The other area was located along the transmission line corridor approximately one
mile west of Willow Creek, where observations included a nest and a few individuals (Figure P-
3). When discovered on May 6, 2009, the nest contained three eggs. On a follow-up visit on
June 23, the adults were not observed and the nest contained only egg shell fragments and two
dead chicks, which were early in their post-hatching development. Long-billed Curlews were
also identified by the ORNHIC as occurring in the vicinity of the project area; however, all
observations were greater than one-half mile from the proposed Carty Generating Station.

The Grasshopper Sparrow was identified by the ORNHIC as occurring greater than two miles
east of the proposed Carty Generating Station, and no Grasshopper Sparrows were identified
during field surveys.

PGE has identified seven sensitive species in its annual breeding bird and raptor surveys over the
past 13 years (1997­2009) in and around the Project area (PGE 2010). These surveys were
conducted primarily in the vicinity of the Carty Reservoir and the Boardman Plant. Sensitive

Curlew, Grasshopper Sparrow, Burrowing Owl, Bald Eagle, Ferruginous Hawk, and Swainson's
Hawk. Loggerhead Shrike, Long-billed Curlew, Burrowing Owl, and Swainson's Hawk are
documented breeders in the project area.



P.9      DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS

OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(F) A description of the nature, extent and duration of potential
adverse impacts on the habitat identified in OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(B) and species identified
in OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(D) that could result from construction, operation, and retirement of
the proposed facility.

Response: This section contains a description of potential adverse impacts of the proposed
facility to habitats and wildlife. The nature, extent, and duration of potential adverse impacts
that could result from construction, operation, and retirement of the facility were identified,
based on the existing values of each site that would be directly or indirectly impacted by the
proposed energy facility and transmission line. Impacts identified include temporary and/or
long-term habitat loss or alteration and disturbance from equipment and people during
construction.

Raptor Nests

Construction of the Carty Generating Station, which is expected to occur over a three- to five-
year period, could cause disturbance to the Red-tailed Hawks over three to five nesting seasons.
Operation of the Carty Generating Station would likely continue to be a disturbance factor;
however, Red-tailed Hawks are generally tolerant of land development and easily habituate to
human activity (Poole et al. 2002). This is evidenced further by the hawks' persistence
regardless of the active nest's close proximity to the Boardman Plant. The Great Horned Owl
nest could also be disturbed by construction and operation of the Carty Generating Station,
although a large stand of trees and a portion of the Carty reservoir provide a buffer that could act
to decrease the potential effect of construction and operation of the facility on the nest.

Construction of the transmission line, which is expected to occur over a two-year period, would
result in potential disturbance to the two Corvid nests located in the existing transmission towers
over two nesting seasons. One of these nests is a historic Golden Eagle Nest, and there is
potential for disturbance from construction if it were occupied by a breeding pair during the
construction period. Operation of the transmission line would be unlikely to disturb the nests, as
the new transmission line would be constructed along an existing corridor, and any habitat
disturbance from construction would be temporary.

Construction and operation of the Carty Generating Station and proposed transmission line
would likely only have minor impacts to individuals of these species, as they do not appear to

Exhibit P                                                                                   Final 2011
currently breed in the analysis area, or they are currently exposed to disturbance from the
existing Boardman Plant.

Sensitive Species

Construction of the transmission line, which is expected to occur over a two-year period, could
potentially disturb the Burrowing Owl nesting colony over two nesting seasons; however, the
Burrowing Owls' tolerance of human activity, combined with the distance of the colony from the
project area would likely only cause minimal disturbance. Additionally, the colony did not
appear to be occupied during 2010 surveys. Operation of the transmission line would be unlikely
to disturb the nesting colony, as the new transmission line would be constructed along an
existing corridor, and any habitat disturbance from construction would be temporary. The
inactive raptor nest approximately one-quarter-mile southwest of the proposed transmission line
would not be disturbed from construction or operation of the transmission line if it remains
inactive. However, if the species that constructed the nest returns to use the same nest or builds a
new nest in the immediate vicinity, construction of the transmission line could cause a
disturbance. Operation of the transmission line would be unlikely to cause a disturbance ,as the
new transmission line would be constructed along an existing corridor, and any habitat
disturbance from construction would be temporary.

Long-billed Curlews are somewhat tolerant of human disturbance resulting in minor habitat
degradation; however, excessive disturbance can result in nest abandonment and disruption of
parental behaviors (Dugger and Dugger 2002). Construction of the Carty Generating Station and
transmission line would likely disturb Long-billed Curlews nesting in close proximity and could
result in nest abandonment. Future operation of the Generating Station would likely continue to
be a disturbance factor for breeding Long-billed Curlews. Operation of the transmission line
would likely not cause continued disturbance to nesting curlews

Construction of the Carty Generating Station and transmission line could disturb Swainson's
Hawks in the vicinity, although it would not likely result in significant impacts because the
raptors could easily avoid the construction area, and any disturbance would be temporary.
Operation of the Carty Generating Station and transmission line would not likely disturb
Swainson's Hawks.

The white-tailed jackrabbit could potentially be disturbed by construction of the Carty
Generating Station and transmission line, although construction impacts would be temporary.
Operation is not likely to adversely affect this species because the project would be constructed
adjacent to an existing energy generation facility and transmission line which the white-tailed
jackrabbit currently persists near.

One Loggerhead Shrike was observed in the transmission line survey area during 2010 surveys.
Construction could potentially disturb this species, although it is unlikely because disturbance
would be temporary. It is unlikely that operation of the energy generating facility or the

transmission line would adversely affect this species because they are being constructed adjacent
to an existing energy generation facility and transmission line.

Construction and operation of the proposed Carty Generating Station and transmission line
would likely have no impact on the Grasshopper Sparrow. The Greater Sage-grouse and Sage
Sparrow were not identified as occurring in the analysis area through review of the ORNHIC
database and were not documented during field surveys; therefore, construction and operation of
the proposed Carty Generating Station and transmission line would likely have no impact on
these species.

Avian Species

A total of 36 avian species were documented during 2009 and 2010 field surveys of the Energy
Facility (20 species) and transmission line (26 species) survey areas (Table P-5). Construction of
the Generating Station would result in a permanent loss of habitat for most of the species
identified in the project area (see section P-7 for discussions of raptors and sensitive species).
Species such as the Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica), that readily nest in human structures
(Brown and Brown 1999) may benefit from the construction of structures for the Carty
Generating Station. Operation of the Carty Generating Station would also likely cause continued
disturbance to avian species in the immediate vicinity of the facility. Avian habitat impacts from
construction of the transmission line would likely be short-term, with disturbed areas expected to
resemble adjacent undisturbed areas in three to five growing seasons. With the exception of the
sensitive species described above, the avian species identified within the analysis area are
relatively common and would likely utilize surrounding habitats during the construction phase
and repopulate the transmission line corridor as the area revegetates. Operation of the
transmission line would likely cause no disturbance to avian species, as the new transmission
lines would be adjacent to an existing transmission line.

Transmission Lines and Avian Electrocution

Concerns with power lines and raptors are typically associated with electrocution. Raptors are
electrocuted when they contact two energized conductors or an energized conductor and
grounded hardware (APLIC 1996). Among avian species, raptors are at greatest risk of
electrocution because of their large wingspans and tendency to perch on power poles.
Transmission lines generally carry greater than 69 kilovolts (kV) and are designed to transmit
large blocks of energy long distances. Electrocution from transmission lines is very rare because
the distances between conductors, and between conductors and grounded hardware, are greater
than the wingspan of any raptor (APLIC 1996). The 500-kV transmission line proposed in this
application does not represent an electrocution risk for raptors. A wildlife and habitat mitigation
and restoration plan that includes avian protection measures has been developed in consultation
with ODFW and USFWS and includes an Avian Protection Plan. This document is included in
Appendix P-3.

P.10     MITIGATION MEASURES

OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(G) A description of any measures proposed by the applicant to avoid,
reduce, or mitigate the potential adverse impacts described in OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(F) in
accordance with the ODFW mitigation goals described in OAR 635-415-0025 and a discussion
of how the proposed measures would achieve those goals.

Response: Avoidance and minimization of significant potential impacts that were employed in
the project design include the following: (1) siting the proposed power plant at a site intended for
energy generation projects and adjacent to an existing power plant; (2) aligning the proposed
transmission line so that it uses an existing ROW; (3) prohibiting equipment from entering
perennial and intermittent streams; (4) siting the construction laydown area on an already
developed/disturbed site; (5) utilizing existing water intake structures to provide process water
for the power plant, rather than constructing a separate new facility. For the impacts that could
not be avoided or minimized, mitigation was developed to provide compensation, using reliable
methods, and in compliance with the ODFW habitat mitigation goals and standards (OAR 635-
415-0025). A wildlife and habitat mitigation and monitoring plan is included in Appendix P-3.

Raptor Nests

If determined necessary in coordination with ODFW, the existing Osprey nest platform located
on the western side of the reservoir could be relocated prior to construction. Moving the
platform to the southern end of the reservoir would increase the distance from the Carty
Generating Station from less than one-half mile to approximately 1 mile. The nest platform
would be moved outside of the nesting season (between October 1 and March 30).

Impacts at other raptor nests would be avoided by: (1) conducting pre-construction surveys to
determine location of active raptor nests within the project analysis area, and (2) avoiding
construction within a species appropriate buffer around raptor nests during the nesting season.
PGE will work with ODFW to establish species appropriate buffer distances around raptor nests.
If avoidance is not practical, PGE will complete a mitigation project approved by ODFW that
meets the requirements of the Habitat Mitigation Policy for "no net loss." Details regarding the
buffer distances are available in Appendix P-3.

Sensitive Species

Aside from raptors, the Long-billed Curlew, Loggerhead Shrike, and white-tailed jackrabbit were
the only sensitive species identified as occurring in the project analysis area. To avoid impacts,
pre-construction surveys for nesting Long-Billed curlews and Loggerhead Shrike will be
conducted in appropriate habitat. If nesting of either species is documented, ODFW will be
consulted to determine what action, if any, is necessary to avoid adverse impacts. Impacts to
Long-billed Curlew habitat, short-grass or mixed-prairie with flat to rolling topography (Dugger
and Dugger 2002), through construction of the Carty Generating Station will be avoided through
siting of the facility. Unavoidable impacts to Long-billed Curlew habitat at the Carty Generating

Station project area would be mitigated through on-site habitat restoration or creation.
Disturbance to long-billed curlew habitat during construction of the transmission line would be
avoided, if possible. If habitat disturbance is unavoidable during construction, the area will be
seeded and returned to its natural state after the construction is complete. Perching for raptor
predatory practices would be discouraged either by custom design of the uppermost horizontal
members of the tower or by addition of an anti-perching device, such as the Mini-Zena Perch
Preventer or similar equipment, attached to uppermost horizontal members. Perching hindrance
devices would also be attached to transmission line towers where they are located within 1000
feet of occupied Washington ground squirrel habitat (Category 1 habitat), although currently no
towers are planned within this range.

Avian Species

Impacts to high quality avian habitat would be avoided through siting of the Carty Generating
Station. Unavoidable impacts to high quality avian habitat at the Carty Generating Station
project area would be mitigated through on-site habitat restoration or creation. Disturbance to
high quality avian habitat during construction of the transmission line would be avoided, if
possible. If habitat disturbance is unavoidable during construction, the area will be seeded and
returned to its natural state after the construction is complete. To minimize impacts on avian
species resulting from operation of the transmission line, ROW maintenance (e.g., vegetation
removal/herbicide application) would be avoided during the breeding season (late spring/early
summer).



P.11     MONITORING PROGRAM

OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(H) A description of the applicant's proposed monitoring plans to
evaluate the success of the measures described in OAR-345-021-0010(1)(p)(G).

Response: Monitoring is described above in section P.8, and would consist of the following:

    Monitoring to identify potential new raptor nest sites prior to construction;

    Monitoring to identify the location of Washington ground squirrel burrows prior to
    construction;

    Monitoring to quantify the success of revegetation measures; details of the revegetation
    measures are available in the Revegetation and Noxious Weed Control Plan, which is
    included in Appendix P-4 ;

    Monitoring to identify the potential establishment or spread of exotic and invasive plant
    species; and

1                  Introduction
Portland General Electric Company (PGE) is proposing to construct and operate an up to
900 megawatt (MW) combined-cycle natural gas-fired power generating facility, the Carty
Generating Station, and an associated new 18-mile transmission line. The Carty Generating
Station will be located approximately 13 miles southwest of Boardman, Oregon, adjacent to
the existing Boardman Plant and Carty Reservoir in Morrow County, Oregon. The
transmission line will originate at the Carty Generating Station and head west, along an
existing transmission line corridor, approximately 18 miles to the Bonneville Power
Administration's (BPA's) Slatt substation located in Gilliam County, Oregon.

Through out this survey report, the term "Site" includes any proposed location of the energy
facility and its related or supporting facilities; "Site Boundary" is the perimeter of the Site.
Between the preparation of the Notice of Intent (NOI) and Application for a Site Certificate
(ASC) the Site and Site Boundary were reduced in size multiple times; therefore, the Site
Boundary surveyed in spring and early summer of 2009 is larger than the final Site Boundary
submitted in the ASC. In addition, an intermediate Site Boundary was defined in October
2009 which was smaller than the NOI Site Boundary but larger than the ASC Site Boundary.
Unless otherwise noted, within this report the term Site and Site Boundary refer to the larger
Site and Site Boundary which was defined at the time of the spring and early summer field
surveys. The term "Study Area" includes the Site and the buffers set forth in the Biological
Survey Work Plan (Work Plan). The term "Energy Facility Site" refers to approximately 90
acres of the Site near the Carty Reservoir that includes fenced areas that would enclose
proposed buildings and structures, and areas containing evaporation ponds and a
switchyard.

Biological survey work was conducted in the Study Area during the spring and early summer
                th                 th
of 2009 (May 4 through June 26 ). Surveys were conducted according to the Work Plan
which was developed in coordination with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife
(ODFW). Details of the survey protocols are explained in the Work Plan; this plan is
currently under development to reflect minor modification to survey procedures for the 2010
survey and will be provided upon completion, expected to be by February 28, 2010. The
work was undertaken to comply with the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council (EFSC)
requirements, Oregon Threatened and Endangered Species Act of 1987, ODFW Habitat
Mitigation Policy, and the Federal Endangered Species Act of 1973. The purpose of the
surveys was to identify wildlife and plant resources including special status species, and
wetlands and waters of Oregon and the United States that may be present within the Study
Area. Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of this Introduction describe the purpose and status of the
surveys including agency coordination for the biological surveys, and provide general site
and habitat descriptions. Section two of this report presents an overview of the project. The

remainder of this Survey Report presents the results of biological resources survey effort, as
listed below:

         Habitat Mapping and Sensitive or Noxious Plants;
         Avian and Wildlife, including raptor nests;
         Threatened and Endangered Species: Washington ground squirrel; and
         Wetlands and Waters of the United States.


1.1      Field Surveys - Purpose and Status
During the spring of 2009, Ecology & Environment, Inc. (E & E) conducted surveys for
sensitive plant species, noxious weeds, raptor nests and Washington ground squirrels within
the Study Area. The ODFW was consulted for comment on the survey protocol proposed in
the Draft Work Plan. Their input is being incorporated into the Final Work Plan. Surveys
were conducted on foot and by vehicle where access was possible; incidental wildlife
occurrences were also recorded during the effort.

The following sensitive species surveys were conducted concurrent with the transects for the
Washington ground squirrel (Spermophilus washingtoni): Greater sage-grouse
(Centrocercus urophasianus), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Sage
Sparrow (Amphispiza belli), Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus), Loggerheaded
Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), Burrowing Owl (Anthene cunicularia), Northern Sagebrush
Lizard (Sceloporus graciosus), and White-tailed Jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii). Washington
ground squirrel surveys were conducted concurrently with recording habitat and dominant
plant species. Raptor nest surveys were also conducted during Washington ground squirrel
surveys. However, additional raptor nest, avian point count, and Washington ground squirrel
surveys will take place separately during the spring of 2010.


1.2      Habitat and Ecology
Dominant plant communities were recorded across the Study Area during surveys for
sensitive species and, where encountered, noxious weed infestations were identified.
Suitable habitat for targets species was covered by walking transects within the Study Area.

The Washington ground squirrel is a small ground squirrel occurring in grassland and
shrubland habitats of the Columbia Plateau, east and south of the Columbia River in
Washington and Oregon. The Washington ground squirrel is currently considered a
candidate species for listing under the Federal Endangered Species Act by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and is a state listed endangered species under the
Oregon Endangered Species Act of 1987.

Washington ground squirrels may be found in native grassland and shrub-steppe habitats
over silty loam soils, particularly Warden and Sagehill soils. Washington ground squirrels
can also be found in some areas replanted to grassland under the Conservation Reserve
                                                                                      December 2009

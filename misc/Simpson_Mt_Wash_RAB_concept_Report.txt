Introduction

WHPacific and Kittelson & Associates, Inc. were chosen to prepare an analysis of the existing
intersection of Mt. Washington Drive and Simpson Avenue, with a resulting conceptual roundabout
design. The purpose of this report is to prepare a conceptual design for review by the City of bend and
the Broken Top Community, the two stakeholders for this project.
WHPacific, the City of Bend and Kittelson met and discussed the goals of the project. The goals were
defined as:

    1.) Implementing the City's new Roundabout Design Guidelines and getting feedback.

    2.) Provide a Concept Design for a roundabout at the intersection of NW Simpson Ave. and Mt.
        Washington Drive. Identify potential property acquisition requirements.

    3.) Provide good sight line improvements for the intersection per AASHTO guidelines.

    4.) Provide a reasonably accurate construction cost estimate for the conceptual roundabout.

    5.) Determine if the trees are to be removed along the frontage of the property at the NW corner if
        the intersection.


WHPacific, the City and Kittelson have worked together to prepare a conceptual design utilizing the
City's adopted "Roundabout Design Consistency Guidelines " prepared by Kittelson & Associates, Inc.
WHPacific prepared a conceptual design using the new guidelines and provided comments for the City
and Kittelson & Associates, Inc. to review within this report. The following report is a compilation of the
efforts made by this team to prepare a conceptual design for the Mt. Washington and Simpson Avenue
intersection.



The first goal of the project was to provide some feedback on the City's new Roundabout Design
Guidelines. WHPacific applied the new guidelines for this conceptual design and have a few additions to
the guidelines we would recommend. Most of our comments involve some construction
recommendations.


    1.) Page 9, exhibit 7: Recommend concrete surfacing at the bike ingress and egress areas. AC
        paving would be difficult in these areas to maintain proper drainage. The concrete apron would
        provide a straight edge to pave against as well and avoid the possible compaction issues with
        the area at the base of the bike ramp.

    2.) Center Island curb: We recommend a 12" thick by 16" high strength concrete curb in the Center
        Island. This curb receives the most abuse from large trucks. We have been using a bigger curb
    in our designs in the last couple of years and have seen curbs withstand impacts from trucks and
    other vehicles. High strength curb involves the use of fiber reinforcement additive to the
    concrete mix.

3.) Mountable curb and outer curb reinforcement: We recommend the use of high strength curb
    for the mountable center island curb and the outer curbs within the circle. W have been
    specifying high strength curb from cross walk to cross walk on each quadrant curb.
    These curbs along with the enter island curbs take the abuse from large trucks rolling over them
    when the trucks do not navigate the roundabout correctly. The reinforcement adds the
    strength and durability to make the curbs last longer than curbs without fiber reinforcement.

SCOPE OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES:

Task 1: Project Management

WHPacific will create a Project Charter to include the following:

    1.1 Roles and responsibilities of project team members.

    1.2 Project goal and objectives

    1.3 Project timeline to include Schedule, Tasks and the Budget.

    1.4 Prepare monthly invoices and progress reports. (Assume three months)

    1.5 Review Project Charter with City staff.


Task 2: Review previous work and confirmation of traffic assumptions.

    2.1 WHPacific will provide comments and feedback on the Roundabout Design Guidelines prepared
          by KAI.
    2.2 Provide previous concept sketches prepared by KAI to the project team.

    2.3 Collect existing weekday AM(7-9 AM) and PM (2:30-6:30 PM) peak period turning movement
         counts at the study intersection.

    2.4 Conduct intersection analysis of existing weekday AM and PM peak periods.

    2.5 Conduct one site visit.

    2.6 Coordinate with City staff to develop appropriate design volumes.
   2.7 Conduct analysis of up to two time periods using the City's new Roundabout Operational
        Analysis Guidelines.

   2.8 Prepare a technical memorandum summarizing the findings of Task 2, including historical crash
         data, previous traffic volumes and roundabout analysis, revised traffic volumes and roundabout
         analysis, and resulting lane numbers and configurations.


Task 3: Conduct Concept Design



   3.1 Attend a design kick-off meeting with the project team and City staff to discuss findings of Task
        2 and directions regarding the concept design.

   3.2 Our analysis will also include a look at other agency master plans for the immediate area to
        determine their needs and possible plans for future development which may impact intersection
        improvements. If issues are identified, the City will assume the lead role in coordination.
        Coordination regarding any issues with adjacent developments is excluded from this scope.

   3.3 Utilize the City of Bend provided aerial photos and topographic survey for the base plans. The
        normal accuracy of an aerial survey should be sufficient for the conceptual design and more
        cost effective at this point. City to provide Simpson Avenue as-builts for reference.
        WHPacific to locate Mt. Washington Drive design files to help provide a better base drawing.

   3.4 Provide a rough vertical analysis of the approach legs and inner circle.


   3.5 Prepare a scaled, hand-sketched roundabout design concept at the study intersection that refines
         the previous conceptual roundabout design based on findings from Task 2, the City's new
         Roundabout Design Guidelines, and direction from City staff. Sketches will depict critical
         roundabout features and geometric design considerations including:

              Roundabout location and size relative to right-of-way and geometric constraints

              Horizontal alignment of approach treatments

              Pedestrian and bicycle features

              Local access impacts

              Geometric principles of channelization

              Conceptual striping

   3.6 Conduct speed path checks and design vehicle checks on the concept design and make revisions
        as appropriate.

   3.7 Provide scaled design exhibits and electronic copies of the conceptual design sketch overlaid on
         an aerial.
       Concept design layout and location (not 30% design)
       Cost estimate (City estimate work sheets)
       Sight line easements as necessary
       Identify right of way and easements with a range of cost estimates


Task 4: Prepare Final Design Report and Conduct Stakeholder Meeting



    4.1 KAI and WHPacific will incorporate City Staff review comments from the final concept design
         report and prepare a draft and final design report which will include the following:

               The Project Charter completed in Task 1.
               Agenda and minutes from meetings.
               A summary of the technical information and recommended next steps.
               Cost estimate (City cost estimate form) completed in Task 3.
               Location and layout of the proposed roundabout using the City Roundabout Guidelines
                completed in Task 3.
               Crash and volume data compiled in Task 2.

    4.2 WHPacific and KAI will then conduct a meeting with the City and the Broken Top Community
         Association to present the final design report and discuss the findings and recommendations.


Budget:

This scope of work proposal is intended to be done on a time and materials basis to an estimated
maximum of $36,600. As the work continues, the City of Bend and WHPacific will have the opportunity
to mutually revise the scope of work to match the level of effort required to exactly meet the needs of the
City of Bend.
    3.8 Prepare a conceptual CAD layout of the roundabout based on the hand sketch prepared by KAI.

    3.9 Prepare a refined conceptual design of the roundabout using the new City of Bend Guidelines
          prepared by KAI.

    3.10 Look at sight lines through the intersection identifying easements as needed.

    3.11 Prepare an exhibit to identify the right of way needs and any easements needed for sight
         distance and slopes.

    3.12 As part of this concept design, WHPacific will prepare a preliminary assessment of possible
         storm drainage facilities needed for the roundabout construction. Asses possible use of center
         island for storm water retention.

    3.13 Review CAD file(s) of the concept design and provide comments on up to two iterations. The
         concept design review will include an assessment of the following:

               Fastest path, natural path, and design vehicle checks

               Pedestrian and bicycle features

               Horizontal alignment of approach treatments

               Vertical alignment of approaches

               Conceptual signing and striping

    3.14 Conduct one design review meeting with the project team.

    3.15 Prepare a cost estimate for the intersection using the City of Bend's template cost estimate
         worksheets.

    3.16 Prepare and provide a draft concept design report for City review.

    3.17 Refine concept design report based on City review comments.


A final concept design report will be provided at the end of this task for City staff review. This report
will include the technical findings for the final report excluding summary and recommendations. The
purpose of the report is to review the technical data and conceptual design with the City staff prior to
finalizing the report. The report will include:

    Notes: WHPacific and Kittelson Associates met with the City of Bend to review the conceptual report and
           roundabout plans. Fred and Scott reviewed the data and plans with Robin and Nick who had a few
           comments during the meeting.

            The City would like to see the taper on the south side moved to the north of the Condo entrance on
            Mt. Washington Drive. WHPacific will shorten the taper to the North.

            Provide wide bull nose on the North, East and South legs. Provide full width median for the length of
            the median. WHPacific will adjust the Medians.

            Provide score pattern at the points where the bike ramps and sidewalks meet. Score patterns to
            distinguish the two paths from each other. WHPacific will provide the scoring on the next version of
            the plans.

            Provide stamped patterns on the sidewalk with different color on areas of the sidewalk adjacent to the
            circular roadway. WHPacific to provide separation of sidewalk and curb.

            WHPacific shall show slope/cut on the plans.

            The City requested WHPacific to research with Pacificorp the moving of one of their vaults near the NE
            sector of the project.

            The City noted legal descriptions will be needed for the proposed Right of Way takes.

            The City requested dimensions on the temporary sight distance measures in the NE quadrant of the
            existing intersection. WHPacific will add dimensions to plans for next review.

            Robin will review the need for analyzing the WB-67 Vehicle. Robin asked if it would be possible to
            make the central island bigger and decrease the size of the truck apron or push the truck apron out
            and decrease the drive lane width. WHPacific will review Robin's request.

            The City asked WHPacific and Kittelson to review the possibility of reducing the inside curve radii on
            the exits and approaches. WHPacific and Kittelson will review and make changes to the plans per the
            City's direction. Kittelson will adjust their speed calculations to verify if speeds dropped.

            Robin and Nick received a copy of the plans to review and summary of the conceptual design
            information.

This meeting was an informal meeting to update Broken Top on the conceptual design report. The City of Bend
and WHPacific discussed the status of the report and opened the discussion up to Broken Top to discuss their
questions and comments.

Broken Top would like to get an exhibit to show the sight distance and vision clearance for the west leg of the
current intersection of Mt. Washington Dr. and Simpson Ave. The exhibit is to show the sight distance and the
future right of way take for the proposed roundabout. The City and WHPacific will prepare a change order for
the work and prepare and exhibit for Broken Top.

The City also requested a change order for survey services to survey the existing right of way and prepare a
record of survey and legal description for the land in the NE quadrant of the intersection.

Broken Top started a discussion on the 30% costs of the project and wanted to know if there were any cost
saving that could be done at this time. Nick Arnis (COB) explained the 30% costs are very conservative at this
time and designed to be that way. Broken Top asked if the prices would go up from the estimates. The City and

WHPacific stated the prices would only go up if there was an unforeseen issue arise but most of the issues
should be covered in the contingencies.
Broken Top stated they had estimated lower than the prepared estimates but were willing to revisit their
estimates and would like to see the total cost around $1.25 M to make the project work for them.

The City stated with future design efforts the costs would be more refined as the design progressed. The 60%
design phase would be the next step in the process for this project. At that time costs would be adjusted to the
design again.

WHPacific and the City will determine the next steps in the process and add those to the report to finalize.
WHPacific will then finalize the report and this portion of the contract will be finished except the exhibits for the
right of way takes and an additional meeting with the City of Bend and Broken Top HMA.

Next steps for the intersection would be to implement the interim adjustments to improve sight distance at the
intersection.

Intersection Operational Analysis
The  purpose  of  the  operational  analysis  was  to  determine  the  roundabout  lane  configurations 
necessary  to  adequately  accommodate  the  weekday  a.m.  and  p.m.  peak  hour  traffic  conditions 
under  forecast  year  traffic  conditions  at  the  Mt.  Washington  Drive/Simpson  Avenue  intersection. 
The following objectives guided this analysis:   

    o    VolumetoCapacity  Ratios:  Volumetocapacity  (v/c)  ratios  were  the  primary  measure  of 
         effectiveness  for  developing  the  roundabout  lane  numbers  and  assignments.  The  analysis 
         was  based  on  a  target  v/c  ratio  of  0.85  for  each  approach  or  the  critical  lane  for  multilane 
         approaches under the forecast year traffic conditions.  

    o    95thPerecentile  Queues:  Estimates  of  95thpercentile  queues  were  developed  to  ensure 
         forecasted  queue  lengths  do  not  exceed  available  storage  between  the  study  intersection 
         and adjacent driveways and intersections.  


Operational Analysis Data and Methods


Existing Traffic Volumes (Year 2010)

KAI collected turning movement counts on February 11, 2010 during the a.m. peak period (7:00 to 
9:00  a.m.)  and  during  a  fourhour  period  in  the  afternoon  (2:30  to  6:30  p.m.).  The  afternoon  data 
collection  period  captured  potential  peaking  in  traffic  conditions  associated  with  nearby  schools 
(Miller Elementary School, Cascade Middle School, and Summit High School).  

Turning  movement  count  data  revealed  a  weekday  a.m.  peak  hour  of  7:15  to  8:15  a.m.  The 
weekday  afternoon  peak  hour  was  2:45  to  3:45  p.m.  The  total  entering  volume  (TEV)  for  the  2:45 
to  3:45  p.m.  time  period,  which  reflects  a  peak  period  associated  with  schoolrelated  traffic,  was 
1,044  vehicles  per  hour  (vph).  This  compared  with  a  TEV  of  861  vph  during  a  more  traditional 
evening  peak  period  (4:40  to  5:40  p.m.).  The  analysis  described  in  this  memorandum  was  based 
on  the  2:45  to  3:45  p.m.  peak  hour,  which  ensures  a  conservative  analysis.  Appendix  A  contains  the 
February 2010 turning movement counts. 


Forecast Traffic Volumes (Year 2030)

The  future  year  operational  analysis  considered  a  scenario  reflecting  forecast  traffic  conditions  in 
the  City's  year  2030  transportation  model.  The  year  2030  traffic  volumes  were  based  on  model 
volumes  from  the  City  of  Bend  MPO  travel  demand  model.  KAI  used  the  model's  base  and 
forecast  year  traffic  forecasts  to  determine  an  annual  growth  rate  of  3.6  percent.  Assuming  the 
percentage  of  turning  movements  does  not  shift  significantly  from  the  existing  patterns,  KAI 
applied  the  3.6  percent  annual  growth  rate  to  the  2010  base  volumes  to  obtain  the  year  2030 
forecast  volumes.  The  forecast  year  traffic  analyses  incorporated  the  same  truck  percentages 
observed  in  the  2010  counts.  Assuming  that,  with  growth,  the  traffic  volume  peaks  spread  over 
the peak periods, KAI applied a future year peak hour factor of 0.90 to all movements.

Operational Analysis Methodologies

The  existing  conditions  analysis  was  based  on  procedures  outlined  in  the  2000  Highway  Capacity 
Manual,  published  by  the  Transportation  Research  Board.  The  operational  analysis  for  the 
proposed roundabout was based on the City of Bend Roundabout Operational Analysis Guidelines. 


Existing Intersection Operations

The  operational  analysis  of  the  existing  Mt.  Washington  Drive/Simpson  Avenue  intersection  was 
completed based on the existing lane configurations and twoway stop control. Under the existing 
conditions,  the  eastbound  and  westbound  approaches  to  the  intersection  operate  at  a  level  of 
service  (LOS)  F  (average  delay  greater  than  50  seconds)  during  both  the  weekday  a.m.  and 
afternoon peak periods.  Appendix B contains the year 2010 existing conditions analysis worksheets. 


Proposed Roundabout Intersection Operations

Using  the  methodologies  outlined  in  the  City  of  Bend  Roundabout  Operational  Analysis  Guidelines, 
KAI  found  a  singlelane  roundabout  to  adequately  meet  the  stated  objectives  for  the  proposed 
roundabout  with  a  target  v/c  ratio  of  0.85  or  lower  in  the  forecast  year  of  2030  under  both 
weekday  a.m.  and  afternoon  peak  periods.  The  volumetocapacity (v/c) ratios and 95thpercentile 
queue  lengths,  rounded  to  the  nearest  25  feet,  for  each  approach  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  
Appendix C contains the year 2030 roundabout analysis worksheets.

Intersection Safety Analysis
The  purpose  of  the  safety  analysis  was  to  evaluate  the  potential  change  in  crash  frequency  and 
severity  associated  with  converting  the  Mt.  Washington  Drive/Simpson  Avenue  intersection  to  a 
singlelane  roundabout.  The  analysis  summarizes  historic  crash  data,  evaluates  crash  trends,  and 
identifies potential crash reduction factors based on national crash trends. 


Historic Crash Trends

Crash  data  was  obtained  for  the  period  from  January  1,  2001  to  December  31,  2009  from  the  City 
of  Bend.  Table  2  summarizes  the  frequency  of  crashes  reported  per  month  by  crash  severity  over 
the nineyear study period. Appendix D contains a summary of all crash data obtained.

As shown in Table 2, a total of 22 crashes were reported over the nineyear study period, which is 
equivalent  to  2.44  crashes  per  year.  The  majority  of  the  crashes  (73  percent)  resulted  in  an  injury. 
Of  the  22  crashes  reported,  12  crashes  (54  percent)  occurred  during  a  fourmonth  period  from 
May  through  August.  This  may  reflect  an  increase  in  tourists  and  nonfamiliar  drivers  visiting 
Bend in the spring/summer months.  

In  order  to  identify  trends  in  the  annual  frequency  of  crashes,  the  number  of  injury  and  Property 
Damage Only (PDO) crashes was plotted by year, as shown in Figure 2.

As  shown  in  Figure  2,  no  crashes  were  reported  in  2001.  In  2002  the  number  of  crashes  peaked  at 
seven  crashes.  This  may  reflect  a  change  in  traffic  patterns  in  this  year  or  an  increase  in  vehicular 
volume associated with an adjacent development (e.g., school, residential homes, etc.).  

The  crash  reports  also  include  a  description  of  the  presumed  crash  cause,  as  noted  by  the  police 
officer  who  filed  the  crash  report.  The  reports  indicate  that  20  of  22  crashes  (91  percent)  resulted 
from one driver's "failure to yield" rightofway to an oncoming vehicle. The other two crashes (9 
percent) were attributed to illegal passing.  

The  observed  trends  indicate  that  a  disproportionate  number  of  crashes  have  occurred  from  a 
"failure  to  yield."  While  not  all  of  these  crashes  may  have  been  correctable,  it  is  expected  that 
future crashes could be reduced by implementing a countermeasure or series of countermeasures. 
In  2010  the  City  of  Bend  installed  several  nearterm  countermeasures.  The  longterm 
countermeasure proposed at the intersection is the construction of a roundabout. 


Potential Crash Reduction Based on National Trends

The  most  current  and  comprehensive  national  beforeafter  evaluation  of  crashes  at  roundabouts 
was  conducted  by  the  National  Cooperative  Highway  Research  Program  (NCHRP)  and  is 
summarized  in  NCHRP  Report  572,  published  by  the  Transportation  Research  Board.  The  study 
included  36  sites  in  rural,  urban,  and  suburban  environments  that  were  converted  from  a  two

way  stopcontrolled  intersection  to  a  single  or  doublelane  roundabout.  The  study  found  that  the 
average  number  of  total  crashes  per  year  (all  severities,  all  types)  was  reduced  by  44  percent  (+/ 
3.8 percent) and injury crashes were reduced by 82 percent (+/ 3.2 percent). This data is consistent 
with  recommendations  for  crash  modification  factors  provided  in  the  First  Edition  of  the 
AASHTO  Highway  Safety  Manual.  These  studies  indicate  that  similar  reductions  in  total  crash 
frequency  and  injury  crash  frequency  could  be  realized  at  the  Mt.  Washington  Drive/Simpson 
Avenue roundabout.  


Conclusions and Recommendations
The unsignalized Mt. Washington Drive and Simpson Avenue intersection currently operates at a 
level  of  service  of  F  under  both  weekday  a.m.  and  afternoon  peak  periods.  The  intersection 
experienced  an  average  of  2.44  crashes  per  year  over  the  nineyear  period  from  2001  through 
2009.  A  singlelane  roundabout  adequately  accommodates  the  2030  forecast  volumes  under  the 
weekday  a.m.  and  afternoon  peak  periods  with  a  v/c  ratio  of  less  than  or  equal  to  0.85  on  all 
approaches. National data indicates that the total number of crashes per year could be reduced by 
approximately  44  percent  if  the  intersection  were  converted  to  a  roundabout.  Given  the  existing 
intersection  operations,  anticipated  safety  benefits,  and  the  City's  stated  "roundabout  first" 
policy,  KAI  recommends  the  intersection  be  considered  for  improvement  to  a  singlelane 
roundabout to accommodate the current traffic conditions as well as projected growth.

Summary of Technical Information and Recommended Next Steps

Technical Memorandum: Operational and Safety analysis.
Kittelson & Associates Technical Memorandum, dated September 6, 2010 summarizes an operational
and safety analysis conducted by Kittelson & Associates, Inc for a potential roundabout at Mt
Washington Drive and Simpson Avenue intersection in Bend, Oregon. See attached report.

Roundabout Design Technical Data

Horizontal Design
The roundabout is centered on the existing centerline to maintain the existing squared intersection
(90). A 140 ft. inscribed diameter roundabout was selected for the way if fit with the existing features,
truck movements, and drivability.

The entry legs are held at 20 feet minimum to meet City of Bend Fire Department requirements and to
try and minimize entry speeds. The entry radii were adjusted to help reduce entry speeds. The exit legs
are designed at a minimum 20 foot width, but were widened as necessary to help truck turning
movements.

Full arterial street section
Street improvements on Mt. Washington Drive and Simpson Road (East) are designed per current City of
Bend standards for minor arterial streets. The components included are 6 foot bike lanes, 12 foot travel
lanes, and a 16 foot center lane. The center lane consists of a 12 foot wide raised median with two feet
of shy distance from the raised median to the travel lane.

The ends of the median were set at 200 feet from the cross walk to provide protection for the
pedestrian and give visual cues to the driver of the intersection. The lane taper is set for 45 mph per
AASHTO standards (360 feet). The median end on the south leg of Mt. Washington Drive was reduced
to end construction prior to the first driveway south of the intersection.

The Simpson Road (West) connection is made as to match prior to the gate. The path connection on the
south side was removed to minimize the impact to the existing trees and golf course. The path on the
north side is extended to match the existing path crossing. Alignment will be set to minimize impact to
the existing trees.

The intersection improvements will place the curb within 2.5 feet of the existing fence line. The path on
the south side of Simpson Road, east of the intersection will need to be realigned to be behind the
existing gas regulator station. Review with Cascade Natural Gas during final design will be needed to
review access requirements.

The sidewalk and path on either side of the east leg of Simpson Road will be reconstructed to the
intersection SW 18th Street to follow the grade of the street improvements to maintain ADA accessible
guidelines for sidewalk grading.

Vertical Design
The vertical design of Mt. Washington Drive will match the existing profile. This is done to minimize
impact to adjacent properties, and existing utilities. The City of Bend has an existing water main in Mt.
Washington Drive which limits the ability to lower to road profile.
The profile of Simpson Road was modified to match the roundabout grades set from the Mt.
Washington Drive Profile. This raises the profile of the road at the intersection. The profile is then
adjusted east and west to gently match the existing grades.

The centerline profiles for Mt. Washington Drive and Simpson Road were designed to be less than 2%
through the cross walk areas to meet the ADA guidelines for stop controlled intersections. There have
been discussions about whether a roundabout should be considered stop controlled. We designed this
roundabout for the worst case scenario.

Drainage Designs
Where possible, the intent is to utilize the existing drainage system. Where new facilities are required,
the use of non-UIC systems will be implemented.
        Mt. Washington Drive (North Leg)
        The intent is to maintain the existing drywells for disposal and relocate the catch basins to the
        new curb line. Drywells will need to be tested for the new drainage basin. The drainage area
        will increase with the road widening and roundabout construction, but the effective drainage
        flow will not increase drastically due to the landscaping areas.

        Mt. Washington Drive (South Leg)
        The existing catch basins and drywell will need to be removed due to the proximity to the new
        roundabout. New catch basin are proposed at the cross walk to catch run-off before it runs
        across the crosswalk. This will be piped to a new detention/infiltration facility in the SE corner
        of the intersection. This facility will be sized per the Central Oregon Stormwater Manual
        method. Infiltration testing will need to be completed for final sizing of this pond.

        The existing catch basins and drywell will be maintained at the southern construction limits.

        Simpson Road (West Leg)
        Storm water will drain along the proposed curb line from the roundabout west. Rip rap
        protection will be provided at the end of the proposed curbs to prevent erosion. The run-off will
        then be handled with the existing facilities.

        Simpson Road (East Leg)
        Curb cuts with road side swales between the sidewalk/path and the curb will be used to collect,
        infiltrate and conveyance. The intent will be to construct check dams in the proposed roadside
        swales to reduce velocities and increase infiltration. Overflow will follow the natural flow
        patterns to the ponding areas on the adjacent county properties.

Paving Options
City staff has identified `rutting' and `shoving' in the asphalt of the existing roundabouts as a concern.
We were asked to review costs for using rigid pavement in this roundabout. Based upon this, we
provide the following information for your review.

Deflection Testing  Complete deflection testing on the existing roundabouts to determine the cause of
the issues. This will help isolate where the deficiency is in the current design, sub-grade, base or
asphalt, and provide information to develop a better rigid and/or flexible pavement design.
Sub-grade and Base Testing  It is recommended the City use the modified proctor (AASHTO T180) to
determine maximum density of the sub-grade and base.

Asphalt Concrete  The current City standard for asphalt on minor arterials is 4-inches of Hot-Mix
Asphalt Concrete with PG 64-28 asphalt. To help reduce the `rutting' and `shoving' issues, we
recommend increasing the asphalt thickness in the roundabout to 6-inches and use a different asphalt
mix, such as a PG 72-28 ER asphalt to replace the City standard. This is higher strength asphalt with an
elastic binder additive to help give the asphalt more elasticity and better ability to recover.

Portland Cement Concrete  We reviewed the potential to use rigid pavement for this roundabout. The
durability of rigid pavement in roundabouts is the key draw. Using this system will have more upfront
costs and present challenges for staging and constructability due to the length of time the intersection
will be closed. Sub-grade testing, pavement design, and expansion-contraction joint layout will be key
to developing a durable surface.

Right of Way Needs
Right of way acquisition will be needed on all four corners of the roundabout for construction.
Additional right of way is needed on the northeast, northwest, and southwest corners for sight lines and
on the southwest corner for drainage. The right of way needed on the north east corner to construct
the roundabout and provide sight distance will also satisfy the need for the current intersection sight
line improvements.

Additional Items
Based upon past roundabout projects, we have included the use of high strength, fiber reinforced
concrete on all curbs and aprons located within the crosswalk envelope of the roundabout. We also
include a 12" wide x 16" deep concrete curb in the inside of the truck apron. These two elements help
the service life of the roundabout concrete.

A rock gravity retaining wall is currently located at the base of the slope in the southeast corner of the
intersection. This wall should be moved to the base of the proposed slope to help provide additional
area for a drainage infiltration pond.

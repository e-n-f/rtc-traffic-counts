1.       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
proposed retail development located north of Old Charlotte Highway and east of Wesley Chapel-
Stouts Road in Indian Trail, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential
impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic generated by the
development.


The proposed retail development is being developed by Arista Development, LLC. The site is
proposed to consist of 70,288 square feet of shopping center, and a 49,533 square foot
supermarket. Three outparcels are also proposed. Through coordination with the developer, it was
assumed the outparcels would consist of a bank with 4 drive-thru lanes, a 5,000 square foot tire
store, and a 3,000 square foot fast food restaurant with drive-thru window. One site driveway is
proposed to form the fourth leg at the signalized intersection of Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and
the Sun Valley Commons driveway. A right-in / right-out driveway is proposed on Wesley
Chapel-Stouts Road north of Old Charlotte Highway. A third site driveway is proposed to form
the fourth leg at the signalized intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Sun Valley
Elementary/High School Driveway. For purposes of this study, it is assumed that the development
will be fully built out by 2017.


The study area for the TIS was determined through coordination with NCDOT and the Town of
Indian Trail and consists of the following intersections:
     1. Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
     2. Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Sun Valley Commons Driveway / Site Drive 1
     3. Old Charlotte Highway and Sun Valley Elementary/High School Driveway / Site Drive 3
     4. Old Charlotte Highway and West Hayes Road
     5. US 74 and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
     6. Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Site Drive 2
                                             The Shoppes at Hanfield Village – Traffic Impact Study

Based on coordination with NCDOT and the Town of Indian Trail, one offsite development was
determined to have an impact on the project study area. The Sun Valley Commons development is
expected to generate trips that are not accounted for in the existing traffic counts.


Sun Valley Commons is a commercial development located in the northwest quadrant of the Old
Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road intersection. Much of the development has
been built, but several outparcels remain undeveloped. It was assumed that 159,150 square feet of
shopping center would be constructed on this site by the year 2017.


Several scenarios were analyzed using traffic analysis software. Traffic operations during the AM
and PM peak hours were modeled for each scenario. The PM school peak hour was also analyzed
for the intersections of Old Charlotte Highway at Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and at Sun Valley
Elementary/High School Driveway. The results of each scenario were compared in order to
determine impacts from background traffic growth, offsite developments, and the proposed
development. The following scenarios were modeled:
      2014 Existing
      2017 No-Build (background traffic growth, offsite development trips)
      2017 Build (background traffic growth, offsite development trips, proposed site trips)


The following improvements have been identified to be constructed by the developer:


Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
      It is recommended the developer coordinate with NCDOT and the Town of Indian Trail to
       dedicate right-of-way within their property necessary for the future U-4714 project. This
       right-of-way dedication is recommended in lieu of improvements by the developer at the
       intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road.


Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Sun Valley Commons Driveway
      Construct Site Drive 1 with one left turn lane and one shared through/right lane. The left
       turn lane is recommended to have 175 feet of storage.
      Construct a southbound left turn lane with 200 feet of storage.

                                              The Shoppes at Hanfield Village – Traffic Impact Study

      Provide permitted+protected phasing for both driveway left turn movements.
      Modify the traffic signal as needed.
      Provide a crosswalk and pedestrian signals across the southbound approach and tie to the
       existing sidewalk.


Old Charlotte Highway and Sun Valley Elementary/High School Driveway
      Restripe the eastbound two-way left turn lane to indicate one eastbound left turn lane with
       100 feet of storage.
      Restripe the northbound approach to change the existing right turn lane to a shared
       through/right lane.
      Construct Site Drive 3 with one left turn lane and one shared through/right lane. The left
       turn lane is recommended to have 175 feet of storage.
      Modify the traffic signal as needed.
      Provide a crosswalk and pedestrian signals across the eastbound approach and tie to the
       existing sidewalk.


Old Charlotte Highway and West Hayes Road
      No improvements are recommended at this intersection.


US 74 and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
      No improvements are recommended at this intersection.


Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Site Drive 2
      Construct a northbound Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road right turn lane with at least 75 feet of
       storage. NCDOT may require additional storage to meet minimum turn lane length
       standards.

2.       INTRODUCTION
2.1.     Purpose of Report
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
proposed retail development located north of Old Charlotte Highway and east of Wesley Chapel-
Stouts Road in Indian Trail, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential
impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic generated by the
development.


2.2.     Study Objectives
The proposed retail development is being developed by Arista Development, LLC. The site is
proposed to consist of 70,288 square feet of shopping center, and a 49,533 square foot
supermarket. Three outparcels are also proposed. Through coordination with the developer, it was
assumed the outparcels would consist of a bank with 4 drive-thru lanes, a 5,000 square foot tire
store, and a 3,000 square foot fast food restaurant with drive-thru window. One site driveway is
proposed to form the fourth leg at the signalized intersection of Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and
the Sun Valley Commons driveway. A right-in / right-out driveway is proposed on Wesley
Chapel-Stouts Road north of Old Charlotte Highway. A third site driveway is proposed to form
the fourth leg at the signalized intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Sun Valley
Elementary/High School Driveway. For purposes of this study, it is assumed that the development
will be fully built out by 2017.


Refer to Figure 1 in Appendix A for an illustration of the site location and all other figures. Refer
to Figure 2 for the preliminary site plan. The objective of this report is to determine what
geometric improvements are necessary to mitigate traffic conditions on the transportation network
surrounding the site with the proposed development fully built out.

3.       AREA CONDITIONS
3.1.     Transportation Network Study Area
3.1.1.   Area Roadway System
The project study area for this TIS was determined through coordination with the North Carolina
Department of Transportation (NCDOT) and the Town of Indian Trail. Table 1 summarizes the

characteristics of the roadways within the study area. The NCDOT Functional Class map was used
to determine the classification of each road. Traffic Volume maps from NCDOT were used to find
the average daily traffic (ADT) volumes in vehicles per day (vpd) for the roadways. A field visit
was conducted to verify the existing cross-sections and speed limits in mph.

3.1.1.1. Existing
Existing lane configurations (number of traffic lanes on the intersection approach), storage
capacities, and other intersection and roadway information within the study area was collected
through field reconnaissance by Ramey Kemp and Associates, Inc. (RKA). Refer to Figure 3 for
the existing lane configurations and traffic control at study intersections.


3.1.1.2. Future
Based on discussions with NCDOT and the Town of Indian Trail, no roadway projects were
identified in the study area that would affect traffic operations.

3.1.2.    Study Area and Existing Traffic Volumes
The study area for the TIS was determined through coordination with NCDOT and the Town of
Indian Trail and consists of the following intersections:
    1. Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
    2. Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Sun Valley Commons Driveway / Site Drive 1

    4. Old Charlotte Highway and West Hayes Road
    5. US 74 and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
    6. Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Site Drive 2


Traffic counts at these intersections were conducted by RKA during the AM peak period (7:00-
9:00 AM) and during the PM peak period (2:00-6:00 PM). The longer count time during the PM
hours was performed in order to capture school traffic volumes. The PM School peak hour was
analyzed in addition to the PM peak hour at intersections 1 and 3. A copy of the traffic count data
can be found in Appendix B of this report. Refer to Figure 4 for an illustration of the existing peak
hour traffic volumes.

3.2.     Study Area – Adjacent Land Use
3.2.1.   Existing Land Uses
The existing site is undeveloped. The surrounding land uses primarily consist of commercial and
residential.

3.2.2.   Anticipated or Approved Future Development
Based on coordination with NCDOT and the Town of Indian Trail, one offsite development was
determined to have an impact on the project study area. The Sun Valley Commons development is
expected to generate trips that are not accounted for in the existing traffic counts.


Sun Valley Commons is a commercial development located in the northwest quadrant of the Old
Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road intersection. Much of the development has
been built, but several outparcels remain undeveloped. It was assumed that 159,150 square feet of
shopping center would be constructed on this site by the year 2017.


The Town of Indian Trail provided the TIS that was performed for the Sun Valley Commons
development and dated July 2011. The trip distribution percentages from this study along with
existing traffic patterns, location of population/employment centers, and engineering judgment
was used to develop trip distribution percentages for Sun Valley Commons development. See

Appendix C for the trip generation and distribution information. Figure 5 illustrates the
distribution percentages used for the Sun Valley Commons development.


The trip generation and peak hour volumes were calculated for the Sun Valley Commons
development. The trip generation was based on the expected land use type and density. The
average weekday daily as well as AM and PM peak hour site trips were calculated based on the
ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Trip generation for the PM School peak hour was
calculated based on Hourly Variations in Shopping Center Traffic found under land use code 820
– Shopping Center in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. See Appendix C for the trip
generation information. The trip distribution percentages were applied to the trip generation data
to calculate the new peak hour trips. Figure 6 illustrates the expected new peak hour traffic
volumes generated by the Sun Valley Commons development.


Pass-by trip assignments were also estimated for this development. Pass-by trips are the portion of
existing traffic volumes that are expected to enter and exit the site before reaching their final
destination. The trips were limited to 10% of the adjacent street traffic per NCDOT guidelines.
The pass-by trips were assigned to the study intersections based on the existing peak hour traffic
volumes. Figure 7 illustrates the pass-by trip assignments used for the Sun Valley Commons
development. This figure does not show all of the assumed pass-by trips because some are
expected to occur at intersections outside the study area.


Combining the new trips (Figure 6) with the pass-by trips (Figure 7) results in the total trip
assignment for the Sun Valley Commons development as shown in Figure 8.


4.      PROJECTED TRAFFIC
4.1.    Site Traffic
In order to determine the future traffic conditions after the proposed development is completed, an
estimate of traffic projected to travel to/from the proposed development is required. The average
weekday daily as well as AM and PM peak hour site trips for this study were calculated based on
the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Trip generation for the PM School peak hour was

                                                  The Shoppes at Hanfield Village – Traffic Impact Study

calculated based on Hourly Variations in Shopping Center Traffic found under land use code 820
– Shopping Center in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.


4.1.1.   Trip Generation
At build-out, the proposed development is expected to consist of 70,288 square feet of shopping
center, and a 49,533 square foot supermarket. Three outparcels are also proposed. Through
coordination with the developer, it was assumed the outparcels would consist of a bank with 4
drive-thru lanes, a 5,000 square foot tire store, and a 3,000 square foot fast food restaurant with
drive-thru window. Table 2 presents a summary of the trip generation calculations for the
proposed development. As stated earlier, trip generation for the PM School peak hour was
calculated based on Hourly Variations in Shopping Center Traffic found under land use code 820
– Shopping Center in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.

4.1.2.   Trip Distribution and Assignment
The trip distribution percentages were developed based on existing traffic patterns, location of
population/employment centers, and engineering judgment. See Appendix C for the trip
generation and distribution information. Refer to Figure 9 for an illustration of the trip distribution
percentages. These trip distribution percentages were applied to the trip generation data to
calculate the new peak hour trips. Figure 10 illustrates the expected new peak hour traffic volumes
generated by the proposed development.


Pass-by trip assignments were also estimated for this development. The trips were limited to 10%
of the adjacent street traffic per NCDOT guidelines. The pass-by trips were assigned to the study
intersections based on the existing peak hour traffic volumes. Figure 11 illustrates the pass-by trip
assignments used for the proposed development.


Combining the new trips (Figure 10) with the pass-by trips (Figure 11) results in the total trip
assignment for the proposed development as shown in Figure 12.


5.       TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
5.1.     Traffic Analysis Scenarios
Several scenarios were analyzed using traffic analysis software. Traffic operations during the AM
and PM peak hours were modeled for each scenario. The PM school peak hour was also analyzed
for the intersections of Old Charlotte Highway at Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and at Sun Valley
Elementary/High School Driveway. The results of each scenario were compared in order to
determine impacts from background traffic growth, offsite developments, and the proposed
development. The following scenarios were modeled:
        2014 Existing
        2017 No-Build (background traffic growth, offsite development trips)
        2017 Build (background traffic growth, offsite development trips, proposed site trips)


The 2014 Existing scenario included the traffic characteristics that currently exist in the study
area. Existing peak hour traffic volumes were used from the intersection counts. Existing signal



                                                  10
                                            The Shoppes at Hanfield Village – Traffic Impact Study

timing data was obtained from NCDOT and included in the traffic models. Refer to Appendix D
for this signal timing data. No changes to the existing lane configurations were made.


The 2017 No-Build scenario was analyzed to determine the future traffic operations when the
offsite development has been constructed. Existing peak hour traffic counts were projected to the
horizon year 2017 using a growth rate of 3% per year as approved by NCDOT and the Town of
Indian Trail. These projected volumes can be found in Figure 13. The trips expected to be
generated by the offsite development (Figure 8) were added to the projected traffic volumes
(Figure 13) resulting in the 2017 No-Build peak hour traffic volumes found in Figure 14. Existing
signal timing data was used. No changes to the existing lane configuration were made.


The 2017 Build scenario was compared to the 2017 No-Build scenario to determine expected
impacts caused by the proposed site. This scenario included the same assumptions as the 2017 No-
Build scenario. The trips expected to be generated by the proposed site (Figure 12) were added to
the 2017 No-Build peak hour volumes (Figure 14). Refer to Figure 15 for the 2017 Build peak
hour traffic volumes. Existing signal timing data was used. No changes to the existing lane
configuration were made.


5.2.    Traffic Analysis Procedure
All study intersections were analyzed using the methodology outlined in the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board. A computer software package,
Synchro (Version 7), was used to complete the analyses for all of the study area intersections.
Synchro 7 was developed by Trafficware Corporation and allows the user to input data into the
Synchro software and calculate the output based on methodologies in the HCM.


The capacity analysis for an unsignalized intersection does not provide an overall level of service
for the intersection, but rather a level of service for movements and/or approaches that have a
conflicting movement. Capacity and level of service are the design criteria for this traffic study.


The HCM defines capacity as “the maximum hourly rate at which persons or vehicles can
reasonably be expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a given


                                                 11
                                             The Shoppes at Hanfield Village – Traffic Impact Study

time period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions”. Level of service (LOS) is a
term used to represent different driving conditions, and is defined as a “qualitative measure
describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, and their perception by motorists and/or
passengers”. Level of service varies from Level “A” representing free flow, to Level “F” where
greater vehicle delays are evident.


Refer to Table 3 for HCM levels of service and related average control delay per vehicle for both
signalized and unsignalized intersections. Control delay as defined by the HCM includes “initial
deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay”. As shown in
Table 3, an average control delay of 40 seconds at a signalized intersection results in a LOS D
operation.

5.3.    Mitigation Requirements
NCDOT has guidelines for determining when improvements are needed by the developer. The
District Engineer is responsible for the final determination of the improvements. NCDOT
typically requires mitigation to be identified when developments are expected to impact the traffic
operations as described below:
       Overall intersection or approach delay increases by 25% or more.
       LOS degrades by at least one level
       LOS is F
       95th queue results are greater than the existing turn lane storage length

5.4.     Capacity and Level of Service at Study Intersections
5.4.1.   Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
The signalized intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road currently
operates at LOS D or better during all peak hours. The background traffic growth and offsite
development is expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in the 2017 No-Build
scenario. During the AM peak hour, the northbound approach is expected to degrade to LOS E.
the overall intersection is expected to remain at LOS D, but delay is expected to increase more
than 25%. During the PM school peak hour, the westbound and northbound approaches are
expected to degrade to LOS D while the southbound approach degrades from LOS D to LOS F.
The overall intersection is expected to degrade to LOS D. During the PM peak hour, the
westbound approach is expected to degrade to LOS D, while the southbound approach degrades
from LOS D to LOS F. The overall intersection is expected to remain at LOS D, but delay is
expected to increase more than 25%. Refer to Table 4 for a summary of the analysis results. Refer
to Appendix E for the Synchro reports.


The proposed development is expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in the 2017
Build scenario. Several turn movements are expected to increase delay more than 25% and/or
degrade the LOS when compared to the 2017 No-Build scenario. This indicates a need for
mitigation by the developer.


Improvements are being considered at this intersection as part of NCDOT TIP project U-4714.
This project would widen Old Charlotte Highway to a four-lane facility. However, this area of the
project is currently not funded. Four intersection improvement alternatives have been developed.
Two alternatives are typical full-access signalized intersections. The other two alternatives would
restrict certain turn movements at the intersection as part of a Superstreet or Michigan Left design.
All four alternatives include dual through lanes on Old Charlotte Highway at Wesley Chapel-
Stouts Road.


No improvements are recommended at the intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley
Chapel-Stouts Road due to the uncertainty of future improvements. It is recommended the

     developer coordinate with NCDOT and the Town of Indian Trail to dedicate right-of-way within
     their property necessary for the future U-4714 project. This right-of-way dedication is
     recommended in lieu of improvements by the developer at the intersection of Old Charlotte
     Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road.

     5.4.2.     Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Sun Valley Commons Driveway
     The signalized intersection of Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Sun Valley Commons Driveway
     currently operates at LOS A during both peak hours. All approaches currently operate at LOS B or
     better. The background traffic growth and offsite development is expected to increase delay at the
     intersection as seen in the 2017 No-Build scenario. During the AM peak hour, the westbound
     approach is expected to degrade to LOS C, with no change in the overall LOS. During the PM
     peak hour, the eastbound approach is expected to degrade to LOS C, the northbound approach is
     expected to degrade from LOS A to LOS D, and the southbound approach is expected to degrade
     to LOS B. The overall intersection is expected to degrade from LOS A to LOS C. Refer to Table 5
     for a summary of the analysis results. Refer to Appendix F for the Synchro reports.

The proposed development is expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in the 2017
Build scenario. Site Drive 1 would form the fourth leg of this existing intersection. The 2017
Build scenario was modeled with minimal changes to the existing lane configuration. The
proposed development is not expected to impact the AM peak hour of this scenario. The proposed
development is expected to increase delay on the eastbound and southbound approaches during
the PM peak hour of this scenario.


Improvements by the developer are recommended at this intersection. These improvements are
expected to provide acceptable levels of service and mitigate delay caused by the development.
The following improvements are recommended to be constructed by the developer:
      Construct Site Drive 1 with one left turn lane and one shared through/right lane. The left
       turn lane is recommended to have 175 feet of storage.
      Construct a southbound left turn lane with 200 feet of storage.
      Provide permitted+protected phasing for both driveway left turn movements.
      Modify the traffic signal as needed.


According to the TIS that was performed for the Sun Valley Commons development dated July
2011, one left and one right turn lane was recommended on the Sun Valley Commons Driveway.
This driveway currently has one shared left/right lane. The Sun Valley Commons developer will
be constructing an additional turn lane on this approach when the site is fully built. It is
recommended that the Sun Valley Commons driveway and the Shoppes at Hanfield Village
driveway both have one left turn lane and one shared through/right lane. It is recommended the
shared through/right turn lane on the Sun Valley Commons driveway have 175 feet of storage.
The left turn lane on the Shoppes at Hanfield Village driveway is recommended to have 175 feet
of storage. It is recommended that each developer be responsible for improvements related to their
driveway.


Pedestrian and bicycle traffic was counted at this intersection. No pedestrian traffic was observed.
One cyclist was observed traveling southbound on Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road between 4:30-4:45
PM. No pedestrian or bicycle accommodations currently exist at this intersection. Sidewalk
currently exists along the north side of Sun Valley Commons Driveway, but it stops

approximately 35 feet short of the intersection. The current site plan includes sidewalk along the
property frontage. It is recommended the developer provide a crosswalk and pedestrian signals
across the southbound approach and tie to the existing sidewalk.

5.4.3.     Old Charlotte Highway and Sun Valley Elementary/High School Driveway
The signalized intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Sun Valley Elementary/High School
Driveway currently operates at LOS B or better during all peak hours. The northbound approach
currently operates at LOS D during all peak hours. All other approaches currently operate at LOS
B or better. The background traffic growth and offsite development is expected to increase delay
at the intersection as seen in the 2017 No-Build scenario.                         During the AM peak hour, the
eastbound approach is expected to degrade to LOS B, while the overall intersection maintains
LOS B. During both PM peak hours, all approaches and the overall intersection is expected to




                                                                   16
                                              The Shoppes at Hanfield Village – Traffic Impact Study

maintain the existing levels of service. Refer to Table 6 for a summary of the analysis results.
Refer to Appendix G for the Synchro reports.


The proposed development is expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in the 2017
Build scenario. Site Drive 3 would form the fourth leg of this existing intersection. The 2017
Build scenario was modeled with minimal changes to the existing lane configuration. The
proposed development is expected to impact the LOS at this intersection due to the additional
approach. However, the intersection is expected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
the AM and PM school peak hours. The delay could be reduced during the PM peak hour by
slightly increasing the signal phases for the side streets. This adjustment is expected to provide
LOS D or better on all approaches during the PM peak hour.


Improvements by the developer are recommended at this intersection. These improvements are
expected to provide acceptable levels of service and mitigate delay caused by the development.
The following improvements are recommended to be constructed by the developer:
      Restripe the eastbound two-way left turn lane to indicate one eastbound left turn lane with
       100 feet of storage.
      Restripe the northbound approach to change the existing right turn lane to a shared
       through/right lane.
      Construct Site Drive 3 with one left turn lane and one shared through/right lane. The left
       turn lane is recommended to have 175 feet of storage.
      Modify the traffic signal as needed.

Pedestrian and bicycle traffic was counted at this intersection. One pedestrian was observed
crossing the northbound approach between 3:00-3:15 PM. No cyclists were observed. Sidewalk
currently exists along the south side of Old Charlotte Highway. This sidewalk is located on the
eastbound approach and stops at the intersection. No other pedestrian or bicycle accommodations
currently exist at this intersection. The current site plan includes sidewalk along the property
frontage. It is recommended the developer provide a crosswalk and pedestrian signals across the
eastbound approach and tie to the existing sidewalk.

5.4.5.      US 74 and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
The signalized intersection of US 74 and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road currently operates at LOS E
during both peak hours. The northbound and southbound approaches currently operate at LOS F,
while the eastbound and westbound approaches operate at LOS D. The background traffic growth
and offsite development is expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in the 2017 No-
Build scenario. No change in LOS is expected during the AM peak hour, but delay is expected to
increase more than 25%. During the PM peak hour, the eastbound and westbound approaches are
expected to degrade to LOS E, while the overall intersection degrades to LOS F. The high delay
and poor LOS at this intersection indicates a need for improvements without any trips added from
the proposed development. Refer to Table 8 for a summary of the analysis results. Refer to
Appendix I for the Synchro reports.


The proposed development is expected to increase delay at the intersection as seen in the 2017
Build scenario. Overall intersection delay is expected to increase less than 25%. The northbound
left, and through movements and southbound through movements are expected to increase more


                                                                         19

than 25%. These movements are expected to be over capacity without any proposed site trips
added.


Construction of a northbound right turn lane with 275 feet of storage is expected to decrease delay
on the northbound through movement. According to online GIS mapping, the existing right-of-
way on the northbound approach is approximately 60-65 feet wide; leaving no room for an
additional right turn lane. Although construction of a northbound right turn lane would decrease
intersection delay, it is not recommended due to the limited right-of-way.


Queues longer than the existing storage lengths could be expected on the eastbound right,
westbound left, and northbound left and southbound left turn lanes. Adding storage length to the
eastbound right and northbound left turn lanes is not recommended due to the locations of existing
driveways. Adding storage length to the westbound left turn lane is not recommended because it
currently provides 500 feet of storage; a typical maximum storage length. Constructing additional
turn lanes would require extensive roadway improvements such as additional departure lanes.
Such improvements are expected to provide some decrease in delay, but not optimal because the
departure lane would have to taper from two lanes to one lane. No improvements are
recommended at this intersection.

5.4.6.      Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and Site Drive 2
Site Drive 2 is proposed to intersect Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road north of Old Charlotte Highway
and south of Sun Valley Commons Driveway. This intersection is proposed to have right-in /
right-out access. The current site plan shows Site Drive 2 aligned with the southernmost right-in /
right-out Sun Valley Commons Driveway. NCDOT and the Town of Indian Trail have expressed
concerns of this location and recommended Site Drive 2 be aligned with the northern right-in /
right-out Sun Valley Commons Driveway. However, this location is not practical for the internal
site layout. A median currently separates northbound and southbound traffic on Wesley Chapel-
Stouts Road; prohibiting left turn movements at Site Drive 2. The right-in / right-out access of Site
Drive 2 is not expected to have a negative effect on the traffic operations along Wesley Chapel-




                                                               21

Stouts Road. Refer to Table 9 for a summary of the analysis results. Refer to Appendix J for the
Synchro reports.


No analysis of the existing right-in / right-out Sun Valley Commons Driveway was included in the
scope of this study. No existing turn volumes entering or exiting the Sun Valley Commons
Driveway were included in the analysis. The additional future Sun Valley Commons trips (as seen
in Figure 8) were included. The proposed driveway is expected to operate at acceptable levels of
service.


Chapter 9, Figure 4 of the NCDOT Roadway Design Manual was referenced to conduct right turn
lane warrant analysis at this intersection. The 2017 Build scenario volumes indicate a northbound
Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road right turn lane is expected to be warranted. The NCDOT Policy on
Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways was referenced to help determine the
needed storage length. It is recommended the developer construct a northbound Wesley Chapel-
Stouts Road right turn lane with at least 75 feet of storage. NCDOT may require additional storage
to meet minimum turn lane length standards. Refer to the back of Appendix J for the turn lane
warrant and storage analyses.

6.       CONCLUSIONS
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
proposed retail development located north of Old Charlotte Highway and east of Wesley Chapel-
Stouts Road in Indian Trail, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential
impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic generated by the
development.


The proposed retail development is being developed by Arista Development, LLC. The site is
proposed to consist of 70,288 square feet of shopping center, and a 49,533 square foot
supermarket. Three outparcels are also proposed. Through coordination with the developer, it was
assumed the outparcels would consist of a bank with 4 drive-thru lanes, a 5,000 square foot tire
store, and a 3,000 square foot fast food restaurant with drive-thru window. One site driveway is
proposed to form the fourth leg at the signalized intersection of Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road and
the Sun Valley Commons driveway. A right-in / right-out driveway is proposed on Wesley
Chapel-Stouts Road north of Old Charlotte Highway. A third site driveway is proposed to form
the fourth leg at the signalized intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Sun Valley
Elementary/High School Driveway. For purposes of this study, it is assumed that the development
will be fully built out by 2017.


6.1.     Summary of Recommended Improvements
Based on the analysis results, certain geometric improvements have been identified. Refer to
Figure 16 for an illustration of the recommended lane configurations.


The following improvements have been identified to be constructed by the developer:


Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road
        It is recommended the developer coordinate with NCDOT and the Town of Indian Trail to
         dedicate right-of-way within their property necessary for the future U-4714 project. This
         right-of-way dedication is recommended in lieu of improvements by the developer at the
         intersection of Old Charlotte Highway and Wesley Chapel-Stouts Road.

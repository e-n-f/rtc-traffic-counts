                            TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS

SECTION 1.0 INTRODUCTION
This report documents a transportation analysis performed for Dade Oaks, (hereinafter referred to as the
"project"), as required by section 901 of the Pasco County Land Development Code (LDC). Specifically, a
timing and phasing analysis was performed to evaluate the anticipated operating conditions for off-site
roadways and intersections. In addition, a site access analysis was performed to evaluate the anticipated
operating conditions of the project site access connection to 14th Street, including an evaluation of the need
for turn lanes at the project connection. These analyses were performed consistent with section 901 of the
Pasco County Land Development Code and the project's methodology statement and meeting, as
documented in Appendix A.


SECTION 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The subject project site consists of Pasco County parcel numbers 22-24-21-0000-01100-0010, 22-24-21-0000-
01100-0011, and 22-24-21-0000-01100-0012, which are proposed to be rezoned from AR/AC to MPUD, to
provide for the development of 35 duplex buildings, consisting of 69 residential units and 1 ancillary office
unit. The project site is located on the west side of 14th Street, approximately 0.25 miles north of Long
Avenue, in the Dade City area of unincorporated Pasco County, as shown in Figure 1.0. The project site is
proposed to have access to 14th Street via two full access connections, as shown in Figure 2.0. The build-out
date of the project is anticipated to be 2015, with one phase of development.


SECTION 3.0 PROJECT SITE TRIP GENERATION
The daily and peak hour trip generation of the project site was estimated using trip characteristic data as
identified in Trip Generation (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 9th edition, 2012). Table 1.0 summarizes
the resulting trip generation estimate.

The distribution and assignment of project traffic was estimated based on engineering judgment in
consideration of the land use characteristics of the surrounding area and the project itself, as illustrated in
Figures 3.0 and 4.0.


SECTION 4.0 STUDY AREA
Pursuant to methodology discussions, the study area was determined to consist of (a) the roadway segment
of 14th Street from Long Avenue to U.S. Highway 301, and (b) the following intersections:


     14th Street at Long Avenue
     14th Street at Frazee Hill Road
     14th Street (Payne Road) at US-301
     Site Access Connections to 14th Street (analyzed as a combined driveway for worst-case)


SECTION 5.0 TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Existing traffic volumes were obtained from manual intersection turning movement counts and 48-hour tube
counts performed in July 2013. The counts were adjusted to reflect peak season conditions using FDOT
seasonal adjustment factors. Traffic count data for existing conditions is provided in Appendix B.


Background traffic volumes were adjusted to reflect 2015 conditions using a 2% annual growth rate as
directed by County staff. Project generated traffic was added to the 2015 background traffic volumes to
estimate 2015 total traffic volumes. The traffic volumes used in this analysis are illustrated in Figures 5.0
through 7.0.

SECTION 6.0 ROADWAY SEGMENT ANALYSIS
An analysis of the study area roadway segment (14th Street from Long Avenue to U.S. Highway 301) was
performed for PM peak hour conditions. Given the unsignalized traffic control within the study area,
generalized service volumes were used to evaluate available capacity for 14th Street. Specifically, pursuant
to the Timing & Phasing guidelines, a two-way service volume of 1,370 vph was assumed for 14th Street.
Graphics summarizing the roadway segment analysis are shown in Figure 8.0. As shown in the referenced
figure, the study area roadway segment was identified to have adequate capacity to accommodate
background plus project traffic for build-out year conditions (2015).


SECTION 7.0 INTERSECTION ANALYSIS
An analysis of the (off-site) study area intersections was performed for PM peak hour conditions using HCS
software, as summarized in Table 2.0 and further documented in Appendix C. The results of the analysis
identified that the (off-site) study area intersections are currently operating acceptably, and are anticipated
to continue to operate acceptably for 2015 background and total traffic conditions.


SECTION 8.0 SITE ACCESS ANALYSIS
An analysis of the site access connections was performed for AM & PM peak hour conditions using Highway
Capacity software, as summarized in Table 3.0 and further documented in Appendix D. The analysis was
performed assuming a combined driveway to reflect worst-case conditions. The results of the analysis
identified that the site access connections are anticipated to operate acceptably, at level of service "A".


A turn lane warrant analysis was performed to evaluate the potential need for new turn lanes at the project
site access connections, as documented in Appendix E. The analysis was performed in consideration of the
turn lane warrant criteria documented in the Pasco County Land Development Code, which was derived from
the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, Report No. 279.


The results of the analysis identified that warranting criteria are not anticipated to be met, therefore it is
concluded that new site access turn lanes are not required on 14th Street. It is further noted that 14th Street
is not a high-speed roadway, as the posted speed limit is 30 mph with an 85th percentile speed of 41 mph
and an average speed of 34 mph (refer to Appendix B).

SECTION 9.0 CONCLUSION
Based on the data, analyses and findings contained herein, the following is concluded in consideration of the
proposed rezoning of the Dade Oaks project site from AR/AC to MPUD, to provide for the development of 35
duplex buildings, consisting of 69 residential units and 1 ancillary office unit.


 The study area roadway segment of 14th Street from Long Avenue to U.S. Highway 301 was identified to
    have adequate capacity to accommodate background plus project traffic for build-out year conditions
    (2015).


 The off-site study intersections were identified to currently operate acceptably, and are anticipated to
    continue to operate acceptably for 2015 background and total traffic conditions.


 The site access analysis identified that the site access connections are anticipated to operate acceptably
    for 2015 total traffic conditions.


 The turn lane warrant analysis identified that new site access turn lanes are not required on 14th Street
    at the project site access connections.

3.0   STUDY AREA
      The study area will include the following roadway segments plus major intersections (identified below)
      along the segments (refer to Attachment "C" for study area details):

      Segments
      i. 14th Street from Long Avenue to US-301

      Intersections
      a. 14th Street at Long Avenue
      b. 14th Street at Frazee Hill Road
      c. 14th Street at US-301
      d. Site Access Connection(s) to 14th Street

4.0   TRIP GENERATION
      For the purposes of analysis, the trip generation for the project site will be based on the Institute of
      Transportation Engineers (ITE) 9th Edition, Trip Generation Manual, using the multi-family land use
      category (ITE LUC 230). (refer to Attachment "D" for trip generation details)

5.0   INTERNAL CAPTURE/PASS-BY
      a. Internal Capture: No internal capture is proposed as the project is a single use.

      b. Pass-By: No pass-by is proposed as the project is residential.

6.0   BACKGROUND GROWTH PROCEDURE
      a. Growth Rate: 2% per year (minimum County growth rate)

      b. In no case will negative growth rates be allowed.

7.0   DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
      a. The project traffic distribution will be performed manually and will be based on the land use
          characteristics of the surrounding area and the project itself. (refer to Attachment "E" for
          proposed project traffic distribution)

8.0   ANALYSIS
      a. Given the unsignalized traffic control within the study area, it is proposed that generalized service
         volumes be used to evaluate available capacity for 14th Street. Specifically, pursuant to the Timing
         & Phasing guidelines, a two-way service volume of 1,370 vph will be assumed for 14th Street.

      b. Study intersections, including the site access connections, will be analyzed using HCS.

      c.   Site access analyses will be performed for AM & PM peak hour conditions, and off-site analyses
           will be performed for PM peak hour conditions only.

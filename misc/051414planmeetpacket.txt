I.      Site Location and Description

                The proposed Residential development is comprised of approximately 24 acres

        located in Section 19, Township 9 South, Range 2 East, Southeastern Land District, East

        of the Mississippi River, Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The site is further located on the

        northern right of way of William Ficklin Road approximately 0.8 miles east of Airline

        Highway (U.S. 61) as shown on Exhibit 1, the Vicinity Map.

                The existing properties to the north of the site are zoned as Medium Intensity and

        is not fully developed. The properties to the south, east, and west of the development are

        zoned as Rural, and are primarily residential and open pasture. To the east is an existing

        residential subdivision.

                The pre-developed site is primarily wooded and generally slopes from the

        northeast to the southwest. The existing conditions are depicted on Exhibit 4, the Pre-

        Development Watershed Maps. This property also accepts off-site drainage areas from

        the adjacent properties to the north.

                The proposed development plan for this property is to construct a residential

        subdivision having 54 lots with varied dimensions and a park area for residents as shown

        in Exhibit 6, Preliminary Site Plan. Preliminary Designs consist of one entrance along

        William Ficklin Road with curb & gutter streets and subsurface drainage. Two proposed

        detention ponds will be utilized to reduce the 10-year post-development runoff from the

        site to the 10-year pre-development flow rate.

                According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the National Resource

        Conservation Service web Soil Survey, the soil types on this property includes the

        following: Acy silt loam (Ac) and Deerfor-Verdun complex (Dv). The Soil Map and

        Map Unit Legend are shown in Exhibit 2. The Louisiana Hydraulic Classification for the

        soil on this site is approximately 57% type C and 43% is of type D per the Louisiana

        Department of Transportation and Development’s Hydraulics Manual.

                The subject site is located within Flood Zone X as shown on the Flood Insurance

         rate Map Number 22005C0045E attached as Exhibit 3 According to the FIRM map, this

         area is protected from the Mississippi River 1% annual chance flood hazard by levee,

         dike or other structure.

II.     Design Considerations and Analysis

                The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how storm water management

        techniques will be utilized to mitigate the increase in flows from the proposed

        development. HydroCAD Storm Water Modeling Software was used for calculation

        purposes. This program combines both the capabilities of the Soil Conservation Service

        Method TR-20 and TR-55. The flows produced by the 10-year and 100-year post-

        developed conditions will be mitigated to Pre-Development flows by utilizing two storm

        water detention ponds. A 24-hour storm of 10-year and 100-year frequencies were

        analyzed and results can be found in the appendences.

                In order to minimize the impact due to the increased rate of storm water runoff

        from this project to the adjacent properties, existing and proposed conditions were

        analyzed. The SCS method was utilized to determine peak flows and hydrographs for

        each of these conditions.    These peak flows and hydrographs were analyzed with

        HydroCAD Storm Water Modeling Software to design two storm water detention ponds

        capable of performing all the necessary detention. All detention facilities were designed

        based on a 10-year 24-hour storm as required by the Ascension Parish Drainage

        Ordinance. The modeling results for a 10-year and 100-year storm can be found in the

        Appendices.

                 The Pre-Development condition of this property is a wooded rural area. The

        majority of the land slopes primarily from the northeast corner toward the southwest

        portion of the site. Drainage from this site travels through roadside ditches and eventually

        into Black Bayou.

                 These conditions can be seen on Exhibit 4, the Pre-Development Watershed Map.

        The Pre-Development conditions were entered into the HydroCAD Storm Water

        Modeling Software to determine the Pre-Development 10-year flows which are shown

        below:

                 As shown on the Pre-Development Watershed Map, Exhibit 4, drainage area 1S

        drains in a southwesterly direction to the existing roadside ditches along William Ficklin

        Road which eventually discharges into Black Bayou. Sites 2S and 3S each flow easterly

        and discharge into an existing drainage swale and ditch that runs east to Black Bayou.

        The total discharge from the site to Black Bayou for the 10-year flow is 56.45CFS. A

        flow of 49.52 CFS runs through the existing roadside ditches to Black Bayou and the

        remaining 6.92 CFS is through the drainage swale and ditch located toward the northeast

        corner of the site.

                 Under Post-Development conditions the site will contain residential lots, two

        detention ponds and park area. The residential portion of the development will consist of

        54 home sites approximately ¼ to ½ acres in size. SCS values of between 80 and 90 are

        used dependant on average lot size and with soil types C and D will be used respectively.

        There are 2.0 acres of proposed park and recreation areas within the development. There

        are also two detention ponds that are located within the development. The Storm water

        generated from the post-development condition will be captured in a combination of sub-

        surface and open channel drainage systems and routed to the detention ponds located

        within the development.            These conditions can be seen on the Post-Development

        Watershed Map (Exhibit 5). The detention ponds will reduce the 10-year post-developed

        flow back to pre-development levels. The Post-developed 10-year and 100-year peak

        flows were calculated in the same method as the flows in the pre-development condition.

        All offsite flows will be the same as the flows generated in the pre-development

        condition. The 10-year storms produce peak flows shown on the table below:

        structure will consist of a 24" culvert and discharge into the roadside ditch along William

        Ficklin Road. The 10-year storm will utilize approximately 1.878 acre feet pond volume;

        have a peak 10-year water surface of 19.02’, and exiting peak flows of 18.75 CFS and

        26.18 CFS for the 10 and 100 year storms respectively. The 100-year storm will produce

        a peak water surface elevation of 20.46’ which is 0.54' less than the proposed top of bank

        elevation of 21.0’. A 2'x2' horizontal orifice/grate structure will be used as an emergency

        overflow structure at elevation 19.50 will allow for flow to enter the outfall system.

                Detention pond 2 will have a static water surface area of approximately 1.01

        acres. The static water surface elevation will be 16.00' with 4:1 side slopes. The outfall

        structure will consist of a 15" culvert and discharge into the existing ditch on the north

        side of Windscape Place Subdivision. The 10-year storm will utilize approximately

        3.274 acre feet pond volume; have a peak 10-year water surface of 18.79’, and exiting

        peak flows of 6.83 CFS and 17.78 CFS for the 10 and 100 year storms. The 100-year

        storm will produce a peak water surface elevation of 19.77’ which is 1.23' less than the

        proposed top bank elevation of 21.0’. An emergency outfall channel is provided at

        elevation 19.50 which will also discharge into the same ditch as the primary outfall.

                The mitigated flows from Pond 1 will be directed to the existing William Ficklin

        roadside ditch. From here, the flow will follow the same path as the pre-developed

        condition to the Black Bayou. The mitigated flows from Pond 2 will discharge into the

        ditch which runs along the north side of the Windscape Place Subdivision, as they had in

        the pre developed condition, and then into Black Bayou. The detention ponds will detain

        the flows from the developed areas so that the post developed flows will not exceed the

        pre developed flows. Offsite areas will remain in their existing conditions and the flow

        received will be routed through the site and to the existing ditch north of Windscape

        Subdivision. The calculations provided in Appendix B show that the proposed structures

        are adequately sized for this purpose. The developed lots along the subdivision boundary

        lines, open swales and subsurface drainage systems will be utilized to catch on-site and

        off-site runoff to be routed through the site as shown in Exhibit 5, Post-Development

        Watershed Map.

                No increase in flow will be allowed to enter the Black Bayou from this site. By

        use of the mitigation measures described in this study, the entire watershed to Black

        Bayou will have a total 10-year flow of 25.81 CFS (18.98 CFS via the roadside ditches to

        Black Bayou and 6.83 CFS via the rear ditch north of Windscape Place).

III.    Recommendations and Conclusions

                The purpose of this Drainage Impact study is to identify the potential drainage

        impacts from the development of this project, and to demonstrate that the proposed storm

        water detention methods will result in no significant impacts to the adjacent watershed.

        The existing and proposed drainage conditions were analyzed and the results shown.

                As the computations indicate, the post-development 10-year peak flow contained

        within or passing through our project is 25.81 CFS. The project will result in a decrease

        in the 10-year peak discharge for the regional watershed of approximately 30.6 CFS. It is

        also demonstrated in the calculations that the 100-year storm event is contained within

        the proposed pond without over-topping while maintaining a peak water surface that is

        less than the existing ground elevation. This hydrologic analysis concludes that this

        development with the aforementioned storm water management methods will not

        adversely impact the upstream or downstream properties.

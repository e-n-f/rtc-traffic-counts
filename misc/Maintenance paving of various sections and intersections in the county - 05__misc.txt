ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This plan is an update to the NCBP Master Plan that was created by David Evans and Associates (DEA) in 2000. It is
not intended to replace the master plan prepared by DEA, rather the intent is to build on the foundation previously
developed. The plan builds on and refines the concepts created in 2000 and provides updates based on current
regulations and conditions. Many of the concepts, approaches and in some cases language were incorporated from
the 2000 plan prepared by DEA.

INTRODUCTION
The North Coast Business Park (NCBP) was established in 1991 through a trade of foreclosed properties and
originally comprised approximately 270 acres located in Warrenton, Oregon. A major planning effort was undertaken
in 1999 to develop a Master Plan for the NCBP, this effort was led by David Evans and Associates in close
coordination with Clatsop County and the City of Warrenton. In March of 2000, a master plan for the NCBP Master
Plan was completed that established a number of goals for the development of property. Since that time, portions of
the plan area have developed, new development standards have been adopted by Warrenton, and the local market
conditions have changed.
A development plan for this property was completed in 1999 and updated in 2000; this report established the concept
to sell the commercial property along the highway, approximately 75 acres, and use the proceeds to cover the cost of
developing the remaining property. The area was rezoned and in May of 2009, Clatsop County sold 75 acres of
highway frontage property (Phase 1) for commercial uses for $8.6 million dollars. The area was subdivided into eight
(8) lots and developed as the North Coast Retail Center. A Costco wholesale warehouse and Goodwill retail store
have been developed on the site. The North Coast Retail Center has remaining lots available for retail and restaurant
development. A Home Depot store is located across Highway 101 with additional retail pad sites that were under
development at the time of this plan.
The Clatsop County Board of Commissioners authorized the proceeds from the sale of the North Coast Retail Center
to be put in the County Industrial Revolving Account and reinvested in the future development of the property. A large
portion of the funds are dedicated to completing Ensign Lane, a new truck route that bisects the plan area connecting
Highway 101 to Highway 101 Business. The road construction needs to be completed by January of 2014 per an
intergovernmental agreement with the Oregon Department of Transportation.


2010 Master Plan Update
 In 2010 Clatsop County initiated an update to the Master Development Plan and Development Strategy for the
remaining 195 acres of property. This Master Plan Update is intended to build upon the existing body of work
completed in 2000. This update includes a current market analysis, revised infrastructure estimates, and revised
design standards. The overall concept and design have been further refined to address new standards, existing
market conditions and a wetland evaluation completed by Ecological Land Services (ELS). This master development
plan and design strategy will continue to serve as a guide for staff and the future development of this property.
In February of 2010, the Clatsop County Commissioners reaffirmed the goals established for this property in the
Master Plan. In addition to reaffirming the goals, the Board also set aside approximately 25 acres of property for
other government uses including a potential site for a new County Jail.

    Master Plan Update 2011
THE PLAN VISION
The NCBP has proven to be a valuable asset for Clatsop County and the citizens of Warrenton. It has provided a
range of employment opportunities for the community as well as new retail services. In February of 2010 the County
Commission reaffirmed the vision and goals established for the plan area in the 2000 Master Plan. Those goals are:
        Limit risks to the County by limiting the County’s role to that of a master developer;
        Help create family wage jobs by providing fully developed industrial sites, but limit investment of resources
         generated by the sale/lease of property in NCBP;
        Develop NCBP by generating income by selling the most valuable land (Phase 1) to fund improvements to
         develop less valuable industrial land;
        Favor leasing over selling to maximize long term income;
        Get a substantial portion of the property back on the tax roles;
        Make sure sufficient land is available to accommodate the County’s facility’s needs;
        Design the NCBP to provide maximum flexibility to deal with alternative access and other issues.

It is important to invest the money from the sale of the North Coast Retail Center wisely, to focus on aspects of the
park that will improve the County’s ability to market and attract desirable users. This plan provides a phased
approach to developing the site by focusing on improvements that reduce barriers to development. The market
analysis, prepared by Johnson Reid as part of the master plan update for the business park, suggested that a range
of uses are feasible on the site. The development concept and lotting pattern proposed for the site seek to provide
flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and opportunities for development in the near term and long term.
Space for a new Clatsop County jail facility has been provided. Likewise an opportunity exists to develop a multi-
jurisdictional public works facility within the NCBP that could benefit Clatsop County, the City of Warrenton, and the
Oregon Department of Transportation.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Plan Area
The plan area is comprised of approximately 195 acres located southeast of the Astoria Regional Airport and directly
west of Highway 101 Business. Direct access to Highway 101 is provided via Ensign Lane. On the south side of the
plan area, a residential development of 400 homes is planned with some of the homes already developed. An
Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) maintenance facility is situated southwest of the site. To the north
exists low density residential development as well as a Pacific Power substation. To the west is existing retail
development and Highway 101. Government buildings are situated in the NCBP, including the Clatsop County
Transition Center, Clatsop County Animal Shelter, the Oregon Youth Authority Detention Center, Clatsop Community
Action Regional Food Bank and the State of Oregon Senior Services and Disabilities building. These buildings are
located in the southern end of the park between SE Ensign and the end SE 19th Street.
Site topography is relatively flat as a result of extensive grading in the late 1960's for a proposed aluminum plant site.
Elevations within the plan area range from a low of approximately 24 feet in the northeast corner of the site to a high
of approximately 70 feet in the center of the site. In general, the property loses elevation as you approach the corners
of the site. The site has dense secondary growth vegetation including spruce and alder with a dense understory of
shrubs. Numerous wetland areas exist throughout the site.


Infrastructure
In 1997 Clatsop County constructed SE 19th Street from the Warrenton-Astoria Highway (Hwy 101 Business). The
roadway is improved with two fourteen (14) foot wide travel lanes and roadside swales for collecting stormwater. The
first phase of Ensign Lane was constructed in 2009 as a part of the North Coast Retail Center. The improvements
resulted in a new at-grade interchange on Highway 101 and the construction of Ensign Lane, a three-lane arterial,
from Highway 101 to SE 19th Street. The extension of Ensign from SE 19th to Highway 101 Business is currently
being designed and is planned to be completed in 2012. Sunset Empire Transportation District serves the plan area
Monday through Saturday. Stops currently exist at the Costco on SE 19th and at the SE 19th/Highway 101 Business
intersection.

The plan area is currently served with water, sanitary sewer and dry utilities including cable, phone and fiber optic
cable. The services in general are available near existing development along the southern half of SE 19th Street.
Services are capable of being extended to serve the remainder of the plan area. More detail regarding existing and
proposed utilities is provided in a subsequent section of this plan.

Zoning & Permitted Uses
The plan area is designated General Industrial on the Comprehensive Plan Map and is zoned General Industrial (I-1)
by the City of Warrenton. The I-1 designation is intended to provide for a variety of manufacturing, office and
employment related uses including government buildings. Permitted uses are summarized below:
        General manufacturing (including paper, wood, rubber, plastics, food, pharmaceutical, hardware)
        Research and development
        Professional business offices (including architects, engineers and medical office)
        Storage and distribution (including opportunity for retail sales)
        Woodworking , machine and welding shops
        Auto repair
        Government buildings

Most retail commercial uses are not permitted in I-1 zone, exceptions include lumber yards, automotive service/parts
facilities, and equipment rental yards. Heavy manufacturing of raw materials and residence for a night watchmen are
both permitted in the zone as a conditional use. The City’s new Site Design Review process is the mechanism that
will be used to review new development within the park. The City has adopted new standards since 2000 that will
mandate safe pedestrian connections, additional landscaping, screening and new setback standards. Development
resulting in less than 10,000 square feet of building on a 2-acre or smaller lot can be reviewed administratively by
City staff after a notice period; all other applications are reviewed by the Warrenton Planning Commission. A
subdivision or land partition process will be required to be processed if lots will be made available for purchase.
There appears to be existing rights-of-ways platted in the center of the northern half of the plan area; these right-of-
way areas will need to be vacated prior to any land division.

MARKET ANALYSIS
Johnson Reid conducted a Market Analysis for the NCBP. The analysis included reviews of national, state and local
market trends that could influence the development of the NCBP. The information gleaned from this review was
utilized to develop the layout and lotting pattern for the plan area. The complete Market Analysis prepared by
Johnson Reid is located within Appendix B of this report. The following is a summary of major market feasibility
findings as part of the North Coast Business Park master plan update process.
    ▪    After a long and severe recession, the national economy and the State of Oregon economy are showing
         measurable signs of early recovery as measured by initial job creation.
    ▪    Recent forecasts for the national economy indicate positive economic growth sustained for the foreseeable
         future, with particularly accelerated recovery beginning in 2012. The State of Oregon economy, barring
         unusual economic developments, is expected to endure a longer more gradual recovery.
    ▪    Clatsop County has weathered the severe recession better than either the State or the nation as a whole.
         Local unemployment has trended a full percentage point or more below the State and national jobless rates.
    ▪    Clatsop County healthcare services and government services sectors added jobs during the recession,
         unlike the State and many northwest Oregon regional economies.
    ▪    Through 2020, Northwest Oregon economic region employment (Clatsop, Columbia & Tillamook Counties)
         is expected to grow by a modest 0.9% annually, dampened somewhat by anticipated losses in various
         manufacturing sectors based on trend.
    ▪    Industry sector growth demand analysis indicates the economic area can expect baseline, new industrial
         land demand as low as 13.9 acres through 2020 if manufacturing continues its weak trend, and perhaps as
         high as 33 acres if economic development measures reverse manufacturing weakness.




Clatsop County                                                                                                        6
Warrenton, Oregon
    ▪   Industry growth demand analysis points to nearly 46 acres of new, baseline office/business park land
        demand through 2020 for the economic area, greatly driven by Education & Health Services firms, followed
        by Government and Professional & Business Services firms.
    ▪   Significant additional demand through 2020 could be realized in the economic area given two factors
        identified in addition to organic growth of the existing economic area: Portland metro area spillover effects
        and greater business recruitment/retention strategy by the State of Oregon.
    ▪   For the former, Portland area industrial land supply constraint will spill over into I-5 and Highway 30
        corridors, which in turn will tend to price out industrial/business park users there who cannot or will not price
        compete with induced costs. Lower-intensity industrial land users such as Wholesale Trade, Warehousing
        and Construction will be most likely to spill over into market such as Clatsop County.
    ▪   Market findings indicate that the typical demand profile for business park industrial and office users will
        greatly comprise land need of up to 5 acres per user. Flexibility of park planning for larger site opportunity is
        important from a business recruitment perspective, potentially including capacity for a single site of up to 20
        contiguous acres in regular (square/rectangular) orientation and appropriate access and utility infrastructure.
        Figure A on the following page provides a profile of the various qualities of highest probability users in
        various industries that would seek space and land in the North Coast Business Park over the next twenty
        years.

                                                                                         Master Plan Update 2011
MASTER PLAN CONCEPT
The preferred alternative for development seeks to provide a range of lot sizes to accommodate various users. Areas
for professional office uses are located near existing and planned retail areas, while areas for general industrial uses
are dispersed throughout the site. The concept sought a balance between wetland preservation and need to provide
land for future employment. Impacts to wetland areas were focused in specific portions of the plan area in order to
preserve larger contiguous wetland complexes.

Business Park Programming
The proposed NCBP site can accommodate a variety of uses. Specific areas of the park have been set aside for
professional office space, light industrial development and institutional uses. Types of uses that could be developed
and their locational consideration are described below. The Preferred Concept shows proposed locations for general
types of land uses.

Office Park
North of Ensign Lane and east of Road A is the proposed Office Park. The location takes advantage of the existing
and proposed retail west of SE 19th Street. Road B is proposed to extend from SE 19th Street through the Office Park.
The proposed lotting pattern provides six (6) lots; these lots can be further divided to create one (1) acre lots or
combined to create larger lots depending on the need. This area is intended primarily for professional office space
and other compatible uses that can be contained within a building. The Office Park can also accommodate
manufacturing and distribution uses that are fully enclosed within a structure. Equally important as function is form
within the Office Park where landscaping, building design and site development are expected to be a step up.
Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&R’s) along with the City’s Site Design Review process will assure this
area is developed consistent with this vision.

Light Industrial and Manufacturing
Distributed throughout the plan area are lots that
are dedicated to Light Industrial and
Manufacturing oriented development. Proposed
Road A and B along SE 19th Street provide direct
and efficient connections to the Light Industrial
areas distributed throughout the park. The
proposed lotting pattern provides up to nineteen
(19) lots that range in size from 1.27 acres in size
up to 11.85 acres. Larger lots are situated along
Highway 101 Business and within the southwest
corner of the site. Similar to the Office Park, lots
are designed and arranged so that they can be
combined to create larger sites and divided to
create smaller sites. Lots in excess of five (5)
acres should be retained to provide for larger site
users. A second option, Option B was provided to
further reinforce the need for flexibility as the site
develops. Under Option B the lots north of SE
19th Street are aggregated into one lot to allow for a single large user to occupy a site in the park.

Commercial
The existing I-1 zoning limits the type of retail uses permitted within the zone. The Concept Plan did not specifically
provide new commercial areas, nor did it recommend rezoning to create additional commercial areas. The existing
North Coast Retail Center provides opportunities for new retail and restaurant uses that will complement the


Clatsop County                                                                                                        8
Warrenton, Oregon
proposed Office Park and Light Industrial plan areas. Commercial uses should be limited within the park area to
ensure that adequate employment areas are retained for the community’s long term needs. Commercial uses that
would be acceptable include print shops, office supply stores, or a small retail storefront in conjunction with an
approved manufacturing, office or distribution use.

Institutional
Specific areas have been set aside within the park to accommodate future institutional uses including a new County
Jail facility as well as new public works facility. A little over five (5) acres was identified in the southwest corner of the
plan area to provide a new County Jail facility. In the northeast corner of the plan area approximately 18.5 acres was
set aside for a new Public Works facility. This area provides a good opportunity for Clatsop County, City of Warrenton
ODOT and other users to develop a multi-agency Public Works maintenance facility.

Park Development Standards & Amenities
In order to retain the long term viability of the park and attract and retain desirable end-users it is recommended that
the County prepare and record on the property covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&R’s) to establish
requirements above the development standards identified in the City of Warrenton Development Code. Site specific
amenities including landscaping, lighting, and signage standards will assist in unifying the plan area into a cohesive
district. Specific landscape and maintenance provisions can be established to ensure that properties are developed
and maintained consistent with the vision of this plan. Revised CC&R’s are included within Appendix D.

Design Signage
An attractive and cohesive sign program will assist with the transformation of the plan area into a vibrant employment
district. Monument signs can be utilized on site to serve as gateways at each entrance to the NCBP. Entry signage
at each entrance to the business park will assist with wayfinding and establishing the park as a district. The City of
Warrenton’s development code limits the extent and design of permitted signage. If additional controls are desired,
the proposed CC&R’s provide another opportunity for additional control.

Street Lighting
Public Street lights along the roadway provide the opportunity to continue to reinforce the plan area as a distinct
district. Street lights will provide the necessary illumination to safely allow for all modes of travel to access the park.
Standard PGE approved lights, as currently located in the North Coast Retail Center are adequate to serve the need,
specific pedestrian oriented street light standard could be selected for the Office Park, or the entire park area to
assist in establishing a more cohesive district.

Pedestrian Walkways
Pedestrian access to and through the site has been accommodated through a series of proposed sidewalks that
parallel both sides of each road. The sidewalks, separated from the travel lanes by proposed swales and street trees
provide a comfortable and inviting environment for pedestrians. The sidewalks can meander within the existing ROW
when not in conflict with proposed stormwater swales.

Conservation Areas
There currently exist mitigation areas within the plan area, and additional natural areas were identified through this
process. These conservation areas serve to buffer the plan area from adjacent uses. Within the appendix are revised
landscape guidelines for the plan area; these guidelines are intended to encourage the use of native plant material in
landscape areas. Conservation areas should be identified marked with signage. Once the park is established,
development of a pathway/trail system through the open space areas within the plan area could provide recreational
opportunities for employees, residents and visitors to the area.

Landscaping
The location of the NCBP in close proximity to the Pacific Ocean subjects the plan area and landscaping within to
wind and salt conditions that limit the type of landscaping that can be used in the park. The acidic soils present in the
park further limit the selection plants that can thrive on-site. Within Appendix E are the proposed landscape
guidelines for the park. The objective of the landscape guidelines is to provide consistent landscaping through the
park that is visually pleasing, predictable, and able to thrive. Many of the species selected for use within the park are
native and or suited to withstand the site conditions.

Transportation Improvements
In order to reduce traffic growth and congestion within the City of Astoria, Ensign Lane, a new east-west truck route
was planned for south of the Young’s Bay Bridge. This new connection, when complete, will bisect the plan area
providing efficient and direct connections to Highway 101 and Highway 30. Ensign Lane, along with improvements to
SE 19th Street and new planned roadways will provide the foundation for multi-modal access and connectivity
necessary to successfully develop the plan area.

The plan identifies the construction of new roadways and improvements to SE 19th Street. In order to preserve the
functionality of Ensign Lane only one (1) new access will be permitted between SE 19th Street and Highway 101
Business. Road A is proposed in a north-south alignment from the southern property line through to the northern plan
area. Road A will be the only new facility to access Ensign Lane. Road B is proposed in an east-west alignment to
provide a direct connection from SE 19th Street through the proposed Office Park to Road A. Road C is proposed in
an east-west alignment to provide access to areas west of Road A.

SE 19th Street
SE 19th Street currently provides access to the existing development within the park. The roadway consists of two (2)
fourteen foot wide travel lanes. SE 19th Street is proposed to be improved to add bike lanes, sidewalks and new
street trees. The cross-section below details the proposed improvements for the SE 19th corridor.

Roads “A”, “B” and “C”
Three (3) new roads are proposed within the park to provide for pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle access. These
roadways are proposed as “Local” roads within sixty (60) foot wide ROW’s. Both a “shed” and “crown” section have
been provided, both options include two (2) fourteen foot wide travel lanes designed to accommodate bicyclists and
vehicles, sidewalks on both sides of the roadway and swales to collect and treat stormwater runoff.

Utilities
Planning for future utility needs of the North Coast Business Park began with the extension of utilities for the
development of the North Coast Youth Correctional Facility and the Clatsop County animal shelter along SE 19th
Street. Potable water, sanitary sewer, natural gas, power, telecommunications and broadband services all extend to
the site of the Clatsop County animal shelter near the end of the southern leg of SE 19th Street. Recent development
of the North Coast Retail Center further extended utilities for the development of the plan area through the extension
of potable water, sanitary sewer, natural gas, power, telecommunications and broadband service along SE 19th
Street to a point north of the intersection of SE Ensign Lane and SE 19th Street. Future utility distribution would
generally occur through the extension of these utilities within existing or proposed street right-of-ways. Cost
estimates for the extension of utility improvements necessary for the implementation of the conceptual master plan
are presented in Appendix C.

Water
The City of Warrenton previously installed an 18-inch diameter water main to serve the North Coast Youth
Correctional Facility, the Clatsop County animal shelter and future development within the plan area. The City plans
to extend this water main to the east and north to loop and connect with future water mains serving the airport area.
Water service to the plan area is provided by the extension of a water main from the intersection of Main Street and
Spur 104 of US 101. This water main traverses south on SW Dolphin Avenue, crosses beneath US 101 at Dolphin
Avenue, and continues east and northeast into the park through a cross-county utility corridor. This utility corridor
terminates at the southwest corner of SE 19th Street. From this point the existing water main extends to the north
and terminates just north of the SE Ensign Lane, and to the east and terminates at the eastern end of SE 19th Street.
The development of the North Coast Retail Center added an additional 18-inch diameter water connection to the
NCBP from Highway 101 to SE 19th Street in SE Ensign Lane.

The City of Warrenton is a key provider of potable water on the north coast of Oregon. The City sells water to the
City of Gearhart, the Astoria Golf and Country Club, the Camp Rilea National Guard base, and a number of housing
clusters adjacent to the US 101 corridor. The water system works off the pressure supplied by a single upland
source located 8 miles south of the NCBP. There is one finished open water reservoir in the system located on the
hills east of Camp Rilea. The City is finishing construction of a new 3.5 million gallon enclosed water reservoir south
of the NCBP. Current construction activities include the construction of a concrete pad for the addition of a second
3.5 million gallon enclosed water reservoir and the subsequent decommissioning of the open water reservoir. The
City of Warrenton is currently in the process of updating the water facilities plan.

Sizing of water distribution systems is typically dependent on fire flow requirements for the service area. The
minimum fire flow rate within the NCBP is 1,500 gallons per minute (gpm) as required by the City of Warrenton Fire
Department. The 1,500 gallons per minute fire flow rate is based on the assumption that all structures contain fire
sprinkler systems, independent of structure type and content. Specific structural conditions and building content may
require higher fire-flow rates even if sprinkler systems are provided.

It is beneficial for the City of Warrenton to require all structures within the NCBP to have complete fire suppression
systems or sprinkler systems when it comes to the sizing and extension of water service infrastructure. Prior to the
completion of the water system for the North Coast Retail Center the water pressure in SE 19 th Street was observed
to be around 60 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) with a flow of 1,950 gpm. For this study it was assumed that all
areas of the business park would receive a minimum water service pressure of 50 pounds per square inch gauge
(psig) and a minimum fire flow of 1,500 gallons per minute (gpm).

As shown in the Utility Plan, Phase 1 will obtain water service from the existing 18-inch diameter main located at the
intersection of SE Ensign Lane and SE 19th Street. In future phases of the NCBP this 18-inch diameter main will be
extended in Road B through Road A to SE 19th Street, to US 101 Business and south in US 101 Business to SE 19th
Street creating a looped 18-inch diameter system. Additional water main extensions and loops of various sizes are
anticipated to be extended from this 18-inch looped system as the business park develops.

Warrenton, Oregon
Sanitary Sewer
The City of Warrenton owns and operates the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system serving the NCBP.
The system consists of gravity sewer, pressure force mains and pumping stations with treatment provided by a
sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with a solid settling lagoon.

The “backbone” of the sewer system was constructed in the downtown core area of Warrenton in 1968. The initial
system consisted of three pumping stations and the treatment lagoon, as well as gravity sewers and force mains
sufficient to serve the downtown area. The sewer service area has grown steadily since its initial construction. Over
28 pumping stations have been added to the system, either through new development or when the Hammond sewer
system was combined with the Warrenton system. Currently the City of Warrenton operates and maintains 32
wastewater pumping stations.

In 2006 the City of Warrenton constructed a $10 million upgrade to the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP).
These WWTP upgrades consisted of the construction/installation of three sequencing batch reactors with one large
lagoon for solids settlement and the abandonment of one lagoon. These improvements increased the treatment
capacity of the system which can now serve 12,000 people or 3,705 equivalent dwelling units.

Currently the City of Warrenton is designing a $1.8 million project to upgrade the core conveyance system in east
Warrenton. The upgrades to the core conveyance system will alleviate the potential for overflow at the SW 3rd and
Main Court Street pump station. This project includes the construction of 5,280 lineal feet of 10-inch force main
which effectively transfers half of the wastewater flow to the SW 3rd and Main Court pump station and sends it directly
to the wastewater treatment plant. This project includes the construction of an additional pump station at SE Ensign
next to the boat ramp.

The City of Warrenton previously extended sanitary sewer service into the NCBP. These facilities include a lift
station located near the southwest corner of SE 19th Street, a 12-inch-diameter force main crossing US 101 to the
west and to the downtown Warrenton sewage collection system, and a single 12-inch-diameter gravity sewer main
extending from the on-site lift station to the NCYCF and the County animal shelter. The lift station currently has a
firm capacity of 950 gpm, as stated on the station design drawings. Based on that capacity and wastewater flow
estimates prepared for this master plan, the current pumping capacity should be sufficient through the end of Phase
2 development. The capacity of the existing lift station would need to be increased to accommodate full build out of
the business park.

The existing 12-inch-diameter gravity sewer has sufficient capacity to serve the southeastern portion of the NCBP.
New sewers will be required to serve the western and northern portions of the site. Given the flat topography and the
fairly shallow depth of the existing lift station, an additional lift station would be required in the northern portion of the
business park. For planning purposes, it is assumed that 8-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch-diameter gravity sewer mains,
laid at minimum slope, would be needed to serve the northern half of the park through build-out. It is recommended
that a new 950-gpm pumping station be constructed during Phase 2, as shown on the Utility Plan, to limit excavations
for new gravity sewers to a reasonable depth of less than 15 feet.

Natural Gas
NW Natural Gas installed a 4-inch-diameter, high-pressure gas line into the business park through the utility corridor
at the southwest corner of the SE 19th Street. NW Natural Gas maintains a pressure reducing station near the
wastewater pumping station, at which gas pressure is reduced from about 125 to 250 psig to 45 psig. A 4-inch-
diameter local service line extends eastward in SE 19th Street to the eastern end of the Right-of-Way near the North
Coast Youth Correctional Facility. During the recent construction of the North Coast Retail Center, natural gas
transmission and service mains were installed within SE Ensign Lane to provide further redundancy in natural gas
availability to the NCBP.

Proposed gas lines would be installed within the Right-of-Ways of streets to the north and east along SE 19th Street
and the proposed street within the business park. It is assumed that future gas lines would be operated at 45 psig,
although NW Natural Gas would be willing to extend the existing high-pressure line if industrial processes require a
high-pressure feed. Please note that while NW Natural Gas is willing to co-trench low-pressure gas lines with other
utilities, high-pressure gas lines are typically laid in separate trenches because of safety issues.

Electricity
PP&L maintains a major electrical substation near the northwest corner of the site. Because the substation was
originally sized for an aluminum plant, capacity should be adequate for the types of uses expected to locate within
the NCBP.

Power currently available on-site is provided directly to the NCYCF and the County animal shelter through a service
drop from overhead lines located on the east side of the park. Power would be provided to the NCBP from overhead
lines along the northern and eastern areas of the site. For new services, PP&L would initially install a service drop
from overhead lines just outside the substation (PP&L does not believe that modifications within the substation fence
line are warranted). Power would then be pulled south toward the park access road through a 5-inch-diameter
conduit installed in a trench along an existing gravel road. Additional power lines would be extended underground
west and east in the access road right-of-way. PP&L would also like to loop electrical service lines by tapping into
the overhead lines along the east side of the business park as it develops over time. During the recent construction
of the North Coast Retail Center, power transmission and service facilities were installed within SE Ensign Lane
provide an additional source of power for the NCBP.

Telecommunications
Fiber optic cable serves the north coast area, although the service is not “redundant,” meaning that service comes
only from one direction. If service between Longview, Washington, and Warrenton is interrupted by an accident,
service is out until that cable damage is repaired. According to US West, much of Oregon, outside of the Portland
metropolitan area, does not have complete redundancy. Future line extensions between the coast and the
Willamette Valley will create redundancy.

Telecommunications and cable broadband service facilities that were installed within SE Ensign Lane during the
recent construction of the North Coast Retail Center will provide telephone and cable broadband services for the
NCBP. Existing phone cable was brought into the NCBP through the utility corridor at the southwest corner of the
property. According to US West, enough conduit was extended to the site to allow for future telecommunications
extensions within the business park.

Charter Communications is the broadband cable service provider for the area. Broadband has multiple frequency
channels, operating independently of each other, that can carry voice, data, and video. Broadband channels are
used for high-speed voice and data communications, radio and television broadcasting, some local area networks
(LANs), and other communications applications. It usually has a speed greater than 1.544 megabytes per second
(Mbps).

                                                                                       Master Plan Update 2011
US West and/or Charter Communications could provide broadband service through copper or coaxial cable within the
business park. Broadband service would be adequate for typical light industrial, institutional, and commercial
uses. The limiting factor would be the capacity of the end-user’s equipment, as well as US West’s and Charter
Communications equipment.

Stormwater Management Strategy
The area in and around the NCBP is extremely wet and has high ground water levels with wetlands dispersed
throughout. In general, the topography of the site promotes drainage away from the center of the park toward the
corners. This existing topography coupled with the locations of the proposed development areas effectively precludes
the ability to utilize regional detention areas. Based on these site characteristics, the approach for managing
stormwater will consist of the design and development of water quality treatment, detention, retention and
conveyance facilities for each portion of infrastructure and site development as development occurs.

A Low Impact Development (LID) approach to stormwater management is proposed for the NCBP. The premise of
this LID approach is to provide water quality treatment near areas where pollutants enter the stormwater from
impervious surfaces. Examples of LID facilities are roadside swales, infiltration planters, vegetative filter strips and
porous pavements. Reference standards for the design of these facilities can be found in Chapter 3.0 of the City of
Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) Stormwater Management Manual. This standard is accepted by
the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) for 401 water quality permitting for stormwater discharge
into wetlands. These facilities can be incorporated into the roadways and sites as amenities and water treatment and
conveyance features.

Conveyance and detention/retention facilities for the NCBP would consist of open vegetative swales routing water to
water quality ponds that drain into existing natural drainage ways. Site specific facilities may incorporate pipe
systems depending on the available hydraulic capacity from the point of discharge.

OPEN SPACE & WETLAND MANAGEMENT
Wetlands were first identified on the site by DEA during the 2000 NCBP master planning process. The wetlands are
believed to have been a result of the extensive grading activities that occurred in the late 1960’s. Since that time
Clatsop County has commissioned Ecological Land Services (ELS) to complete a detailed wetland delineation for the
entire plan area. Overall the wetlands on site are generally in poor condition representing a low resource value.
There are no “significant” wetlands identified within plan area in the City of Warrenton’s Goal 5 inventory. The plan
proposes to impact existing wetland areas to provide new roadways and development areas. Large contiguous
wetland areas were avoided with preference given to those upland portions of the plan area.

Mitigation Strategies
Impacts to existing wetlands on-site are regulated by both state and federal laws. The Oregon Division of State
Lands (DSL) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jointly administer the state of Oregon’s Removal/Fill
process. Temporary and permanent impacts to wetlands that result from new roadways and development areas will
need to be mitigated. Clatsop County is currently working with DSL and USACE to permit the temporary and
permanent impacts associated with the extension of Ensign Lane.
Future impacts to wetland areas will need to be permitted prior to development. Wetland delineations are only valid
for up to five (5) years from the date of concurrence. The following information was included within the 2000 master
plan prepared by DEA and is still applicable to the NCBP master plan area:
        DSL requires a Removal/Fill Permit when the total removal or fill of a water of the state,
        including wetlands, is equal to or exceeds 50 cubic yards. As a condition of receiving a
        Removal/Fill Permit, DSL will require replacing wetland functions and values lost due to
        construction impacts. The total amount of mitigation area required depends on total impacts and
        the type of mitigation proposed. DSL requires a ratio between created and impacted wetland of
        1:1 when compensating through wetland restoration; 1.5:1 when mitigating through wetland
        creation; and 3:1 when compensating through enhancement. Restoration is defined as
        rehabilitating a previously drained area by providing wetland hydrology or by removing fill
        material or other means of reestablishing freshwater features. Creation is defined as converting
        an area that has never been wetland to wetland conditions. Enhancement means the alteration
        and/or active management of existing wetlands for improvement of particular functions and
        values.

        USACE administers Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which regulates the discharge of
        dredged or fill materials into waters of the United States, including wetlands. USACE issues
        Nationwide or Individual Permits, depending on the amount of impact to wetland resources.

        Any permit request must demonstrate to the permitting agencies that the applicant has first tried
        to avoid all impacts to wetlands. Next, if total avoidance is not practicable, the applicant must




19                                                                                                       NCBP
                                                                                      Master Plan Update 2011
         demonstrate that unavoidable impacts have been minimized. Finally, compensation for lost
         wetland functions and values will be required by permitting agencies.

         Wetland mitigation is usually done in-kind as well as on-site. In-kind mitigation means that the
         type of wetland lost through development is compensated for by creating or enhancing the same
         kind of wetland, that is, a created shrub-scrub wetland compensates for impacts to an existing
         shrub-scrub wetland. Due to the amount of wetlands on the NCBP site, there may not be enough
         degraded wetland habitat that can be enhanced, or enough non-developable upland that can be
         turned into wetlands to compensate for all wetland impacts associated with full build-out of the
         site.

         Development and on-site mitigation should be governed by an overriding strategy of avoiding
         impacts to the large, contiguous wetlands that currently provide high quality wildlife habitat and
         water quality and quantity functions. With such areas set aside, mitigation for development
         impacts would be directed toward filling in gaps along the large, contiguous wetlands, or
         enhancing specific impaired wetland functions. Larger wetlands are generally recognized as
         providing greater wildlife and water quality and quantity functions than smaller wetlands. To
         that end, increasing the extent of the large, centrally-located wetland by creating wetland out of
         upland that currently supports Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) is recommended as the first
         mitigation strategy for the NCBP. All upland areas supporting Scotch broom could be graded
         and planted with native wetland plant species to create additional wetland. The wetland and
         mitigation area should then be set aside within an open space tract. These efforts would be
         considered wetland creation, meaning that 1.5 acres of created wetland would be required for
         each acre of impact.

         Some existing, on-site wetland areas could be enhanced by planting trees and shrubs in order to
         increase both structural and species diversity of the wetland. Areas that have been impacted by
         off-road vehicle use could be enhanced in this manner. Such activities would be considered
         wetland enhancement efforts, and three acres of enhanced wetland would compensate for one
         acre of impact.

         For additional mitigation of wetland impacts within the NCBP site, Clatsop County could
         develop a wetland mitigation bank. The bank would have to be developed in compliance with
         state wetland mitigation bank rules, requiring multi-agency negotiations and coordination. The
         bank could be developed off-site, but preferably near the site, to ensure that the bank’s service
         area includes the NCBP. It should be noted, however, that merely establishing a bank does not
         guarantee wetland impact permits at the NCBP from DSL or the USACE.

         Out-of-kind wetland mitigation is another possibility that should be formally discussed with the
         permitting agencies. DSL and USACE may allow off-site, out-of-kind mitigation if an opportunity
         arises to restore historically plentiful, but now relatively rare wetland types (e.g., salt marsh).
         Preserving large tracts of high quality wetland currently owned by the County by placing
         restrictive conservation easements on them is another potential mitigation strategy. While
         informal discussions with the regulatory agencies have taken place, there is no consensus that
         this strategy would be appropriate.

The time limits imposed on delineations and the uncertainty of the end users of the property will complicate the ability
to identify and mitigate all impacts at once. The County should continue to work with DSL and USACE to permit
impacts to each phase of the proposed park. The County should first seek to mitigate impacts on-site adjacent to
existing wetlands, and then seek offsite mitigation opportunities.

PHASING
The overall disposition strategy for the park focuses on leveraging investment in the park from each phase. The
remaining portions of the NCBP can occur in four (4) major phases. Phase 1 includes the platting of the Office Park
and those portions of the plan area that are currently serviceable with utilities. Phase 2 provides two options for
development. Phase 3 as proposed would plat the area north of SE 19th into 11 lots and extend Road A northeast
with Road C providing access to the west. Option B would allow for this area to be aggregated into one lot
approximately 24.4 acres in size to accommodate a large user.

Specific Improvements such as the pedestrian bicycle upgrades to SE 19th Street (Phase 3) and Road A south of SE
19th (Phase 4) were identified as separate phases without any associated development area. This is to respect that
these improvements may occur at any time subject to funding and/or occur incrementally over time. Phase 4 would
upgrade the entire SE 19th Street corridor to include street trees, bike and pedestrian facilities. Phase 5 provides for
a connection from Ensign Lane south to the plan area border; while this connection provides good connectivity it is
not necessary for the proper function of the park and thus it is expected that this improvement will be provided by
others.

Phases 1 and 2 involve the platting of lots for development. In many cases the intent of the lotting was to allow for
flexibility so that one lot could be combined with another, or one lot could partition into two. This approach provides
the County flexibility to respond to changing conditions in the market and each business’s needs.

be extended north to SE 19th Street. Option “a” would provide the opportunity to divide the area north of SE 19th into
lots ranging from 1 to 2 acres, Option “b” would aggregate the area into one single lot approximately 24.4 acres in
size. A new sanitary sewer pump station would be installed at the SE 19th Street and Highway 101 Business
intersection connecting into a new force main that will be constructed to connect in with the gravity sewer in Ensign
Lane. Water will be extended within the SE 19th, Road A and along Highway 101 Business. The following

Phase 3: SE 19th Street
Phase 3 is comprised of transportation improvements including the improvements to the SE 19th roadway to add
street trees, bike lanes and sidewalks as well as the planned extension of Road A south to the southern plan area.
Portions of the SE 19th Street ROW will be improved as individual properties develop. The following improvements
are included within this phase:

Transportation Improvements: $2,813,400
        SE 19th Street frontage improvements from Ensign Lane to Animal control Facility
             o 2,320 LF at $540 / LF = $1,252,800

Phase 4: Road A South
Phase 4 provides for the extension of Road A south from Ensign Lane to plan boundary. This improvement is not
required to facilitate development of the NCBP, however it does provide for a key north-south connection to the
properties south of the site. It is anticipated that this improvement will be provided by the developers of the property
located south of the park. The following improvements are included within this phase:

Transportation Improvements:
        Road A from Ensign Lane to southern boundary of plan area
             o 1,655 LF at $950 / LF = $1,572,250

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES
The entire plan area is located within the City of Warrenton and subject to the City’s adopted ordinances and
procedures. It is imperative that the County work closely with the City of Warrenton on the implementation of this
plan. This section of the plan identifies the steps and provides options to assist with the development of the plan
area.
Infrastructure Financing
The proceeds from the sale of the North Coast Retail Center will only provide for a finite amount of improvements
within the plan area. In order to fund the remaining improvements necessary to allow for the development of the plan
area, the City and County will need to identify additional sources of revenue. Developer exactions should continue to
be utilized to finance improvements and provide viable options for the southern half of Road A and frontage
improvements along the SE 19th Street corridor. A list of grant and loan programs available to assist has been
provided within Appendix F.

The infrastructure necessary for full build-out of the plan area goes beyond on-site conveyance and dry utilities.
Clean, potable water and adequate capacity within the City’s wastewater treatment facilities are also essential
components to attracting quality employers and securing funding and/or financing for on-site infrastructure. Specific
projects will need to be identified and included within the City’s water, sewer and transportation master plans and
their respective capital improvement plans. System Development Charges (SDC’s) could be an important component
of this approach. Currently the City does not have adopted SDC fees. The County should encourage City of
Warrenton efforts to develop System Development Charges (SDC’s) to ensure that adequate funds are collected
within the plan area and other areas of the City to support long term facility master planning and infrastructure
development.
Comprehensive Plan
The County should work with the City to adopt the NCBP master plan as a component of the City of Warrenton
Comprehensive Plan. The NCBP master plan can be adopted as a supporting document to the comprehensive plan,
or specific goals and policies can be included within the comprehensive plan to reflect the vision of the plan. The
City’s public facility master plans, components of the comprehensive plan, should also be amended to include water,
sewer, and transportation improvements within the plan area. Inclusion of the master plan in the City’s
comprehensive Plan will provide greater protection for the area by incorporating the goals and development aspects
of the plan into the City’s comprehensive plan.
Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&R’s)
In order to facilitate development of individual properties specific standards and controls will need to be in place to
ensure the vision of the plan is carried through. The vision of this plan will be implemented through the City of
Warrenton’s I-1 zone. Utilizing CC&R’s and an internal Design Review Committee (DRC) will give the County and
future property owners an additional mechanism to control development and assure quality outcomes necessary to
attract and retain desirable end users. A revised copy of recommended CC&R’s is included within Appendix D.

Shovel Ready Designation
In order to entice existing employers to remain within the community and recruit new business the County should
work with the City of Warrenton and members of the Governor’s Economic Revitalization Team, particularly Business
Oregon to identify opportunities to designate “shovel ready” lands within the NCBP. The “Shovel Ready” designation
demonstrates to prospective employers that the site has undergone extensive title work, proof of ownership, legal
and environmental review and qualifies for expedited permitting. Completion of these basic procedures lowers the
cost of site development for business and allows for speedy development of the property, reducing the permitting and
feasibility components to development significantly. The State’s “Shovel Ready” program will also assist with
marketing properties to prospective employers.

Warrenton, Oregon
Park & Trail Development
The County should work with the City and members of the Warrenton Trail Association to identify opportunities for
parks and trails within the plan area. These areas will contribute to the infrastructure that supports development.
These types of facilities will provide opportunities for residents, visitors and employees at the park to recreate and
also assist with interpreting the significance of wetland and natural areas. Identified improvements could be included
within City of Warrenton Parks Master Plan and potentially be partially through the implementation of a Parks SDC
fee.

Sustainable Design
Sustainable design aspects could be included within the master plan area via the proposed CC&R’s. The County
desires the park to be developed in an “environmentally sensitive manner”, the recommended sustainable guidelines
can provide benefit to the local economy and reduce impacts to natural resources. Sustainable development
guidelines can also assist with marketing the property and attracting desirable end users. Appendix G provides some
concepts that could be included within the proposed CC&R’s.

Periodic Review
The County should regularly revisit the master plan and improvements to ensure the plan is consistent with current
market conditions, state, and local laws. If the plan is included within the City’s comprehensive plan, this review could
occur when the City reviews its comprehensive plan and ordinances or it could be completed as a separate process.

Project Champion
The NCBP master plan needs a “champion” to oversee and provide for the day to day guidance of the project. The
Champion could be a County employee, a committee appointed by the County, the Port or a private contractor.
Depending on the approach it may be possible to work with CEDR, the City or other entities to provide this oversight.
This entity will serve as the clearinghouse for all information and inquiries regarding the project. This will provide a
primary point of contact responsible for coordinating projects with appropriate jurisdictions and agencies.

CLATSOP COUNTY | NORTH COAST BUSINESS PARK                                                                                                                  PAGE 1
I.       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following is a summary of major market feasibility findings as part of the North Coast Business Park
master plan update process.
     ▪   After a long and severe recession, the national economy and the State of Oregon economy are
         showing measurable signs of early recovery as measured by initial job creation.
     ▪   Recent forecasts for the national economy indicate positive economic growth sustained for the
         foreseeable future, with particularly accelerated recovery beginning in 2012. The State of Oregon
         economy, barring unusual economic developments, is expected to endure a longer more gradual
         recovery.
     ▪   The Clatsop County has weathered the severe recession better than either the State or the nation as
         a whole. Local unemployment has trended a full percentage point or more below the State and
         national jobless rates.
     ▪   Clatsop County healthcare services and government services sectors added jobs during the “Great
         Recession,” unlike the State and many northwest Oregon regional economies.
     ▪   Through 2020, Northwest Oregon economic region employment (Clatsop, Columbia & Tillamook
         Counties) is expected to grow by a modest 0.9% annually, dampened somewhat by anticipated
         losses in various manufacturing sectors based on trend.
     ▪   Industry sector growth demand analysis indicates the economic area can expect baseline, new
         industrial land demand as low as 13.9 acres through 2020 if Manufacturing continues its weak trend,
         and perhaps as high as 33 acres if economic development measures reverse manufacturing
         weakness.
     ▪   Industry growth demand analysis points to nearly 46 acres of new, baseline office/business park
         land demand through 2020 for the economic area, greatly driven by Education & Health Services
         firms, followed by Government and Professional & Business Services firms.
     ▪   Significant additional demand through 2020 could be realized in the economic area given two
         factors identified in addition to organic growth of the existing economic area: Portland metro area
         spillover effects and greater business recruitment/retention strategy by the State of Oregon.
     ▪   For the former, Portland area industrial land supply constraint will spill over into I-5 and Highway 30
         corridors, which in turn will tend to price out industrial/business park users there who cannot or will
         not price compete with induced costs. Lower-intensity industrial land users such as Wholesale
         Trade, Warehousing and Construction will be most likely to spill over into market such a Clatsop
         County.
     ▪   Market findings indicate that the typical demand profile for business park industrial and office users
         will greatly comprise land need of up to 5 acre per user. Flexibility of park planning for larger site
         opportunity is important from a business recruitment perspective potentially including capacity for a
         single site of up to 20 contiguous acres in regular (square/rectangular) orientation and appropriate
         access and utility infrastructure. Figure A on the following page provides a profile of the various
         qualities of highest probability users in various industries that would seek space and land in the
         North Coast Business Park over the next twenty years.

II.       TREND ANALYSIS
A. NATIONAL ECONOMIC TRENDS

Introduction
The trend analysis section provides the foundation of economic information that will shape realizable
economic opportunities, resulting potential job growth scenarios, and ultimately market demand for
industrial and business park uses.

In the trend analysis, it is understood that as of its draft, the region, state, and nation as a whole are
currently navigating economic conditions not seen in decades. Ultimately, current economic conditions make
it difficult to produce highly timely national trend analysis. Johnson Reid, therefore, heavily utilizes the
economic forecast "of record" by the federal government, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
biannual economic forecast.

Short-Term Outlook

Gross Domestic Product
Over the previous two quarters, economic growth has stabilized with a noticeable rebound as federal
stimulus spending has filtered into the economy and businesses inventory replenishment has spurred
manufacturing activity. Growth in the first quarter measured a 3.2% increase following a 5.6% increase
during the previous quarter. However, economic growth as the recovery takes hold is likely to remain muted
in the near term in light of existing economic turmoil, and continued uncertainly of financial markets. On the
basis of previous recessions and recoveries, the following factors are also expected to contribute to a more
measured recovery period 1.

         Evidence from the United States and other countries suggest that recovery from recessions
          triggered by financial crisis and large declines in asset prices tends to be more protracted.

         Changes in federal stimulus: While federal stimulus spending associated with the American
          Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) may have helped moderate the severity of the recession in
          2009, its effects are beginning to fade. Furthermore, under current law tax rates are slated to
          increase in 2011, further hampering growth.

         Loss of investment income and more limited availability of credit are likely to limit growth in
          consumer spending in the near term.

By the end of 2010, economic growth is expected to reach a 2.2% annualized rate of growth, followed by a
more measured 1.9% in 2011. These rates of growth will narrow the spread between actual output and
potential output only slightly.

Employment
Since the beginning of the recession, payroll employment has fallen by greater than 7 million jobs, reflecting
both the loss of employment and a drop in the labor force. A signature element of the current recession has
been both the depth and duration of employment losses from the peak period of the economic cycle as
determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. As of June 2010 the current recession is expected
to be the deepest, and most lengthy period of sustained unemployment since the Great Depression.

At current, unemployment remains at a seasonally adjusted rate of 9.5%, down slightly from its October peak
of 10.1%. The unemployment rate is expected to remain high, and lag the broader economic recovery as
there is significant slack in the economy. As the jobs situation begins to recover, workers who have quite
pursuing employment are likely to reenter the labor force, delaying unemployment recovery. However, it
appears that the national employment situation is stabilizing, with the pace of year-over-year job losses
declining since the first quarter of 2009 and finally turning positive by the beginning of 2010.

Consumer Spending
While a recent upward trend is an encouraging sign of recovery, spending by households is likely to remain
constrained by slow income growth, lost wealth, and limited credit availability. Similarly, the overbuilding of
residential and commercial space and units exhibited during the real estate bubble created sizable vacancies

recovery period. In the near term consumer spending growth is expected to come in below its long-term
average.

Other Factors
 Housing Starts have remained stable since mid-2009 and were actually up 17% in the first quarter on a
    year-over-year basis. However, the current rate of housing starts remains noticeably weak and is just
    over a third of the 15-year average.

                                         Asset Prices remain highly volatile in light of broad based economic and to a certain extent political
                                          uncertainty. Since January of 2008 the Dow Jones Industrial Average has displayed a Hi-Low range of
                                          roughly 5,000 points.

                                         Inflation in the United States remains low. At 1.7%, change in the Consumer Price Index is low relative to
                                          historical averages. Reflecting a large amount of slack remaining in the economy, inflation risk is low, and
                                          is expect to at best remain unchanged, and possibly decline further in the near-term. If this trend holds
                                          true, the impact will likely be stable monetary policy with the Federal Reserve keeping its target rate low
                                          for some time.

                                         Federal Debt held by the public as a percentage of total output reached has reached its highest level
                                          since World War II. Under current policies this condition is expected to exacerbate further. Persistent
                                          deficits can have severe economic consequences, including the crowding out of private investment,
                                          higher marginal tax rates, limited effective use of fiscal policy, and increased risk of a fiscal crisis.

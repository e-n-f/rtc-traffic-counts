I. INTRODUCTION
In accordance with Section 15070 et seq. of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and its
Guidelines, the Initial Study, contained herein, has been prepared for the San Mateo Union High School
District (District). It provides documentation to support the proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration for
the development of the project known as the Hillsdale High School New Classroom Building L Project.
The proposed site is located within the existing Hillsdale High School in the southeast area of the City of
San Mateo, County of San Mateo.

The Initial Study, herein, includes the location of the project site, project sponsor's objectives, detailed
description ofthe proposed project. The 2015 CEQA Environmental Checklist Form (Appendix G of the
CEQA Guidelines) serves as the basis for the evaluation contained in the Initial Study. The ensuing
analysis of the potential environmental impacts, resulting from the implementation ofthe project, has
been predicated upon established significance and qualitative standards established as part of accepted
CEQA practice and judgement, applicable standards of the City of San Mateo, findings from the review
of pertinent environmental information, and reconnaissance of the site and vicinity.

The Initial Study examines the specific potential project-level physical environmental impacts that may
result from the construction of the proposed facilities at the existing school site. Mitigation measures
have been incorporated into the project to address significant impacts that would otherwise occur with
development and operation of the new facilities. In addition, mitigation measures have been identified to
bring potentially significant traffic-related impacts to less than significant levels.

The District will serve as the "lead agency" (the public agency that has the principal responsibility for
carrying out and/or approving a project) for the proposed facilities and for compliance with the CEQA
environmental review requirements. The Initial Study document and the proposed adoption of a
Mitigated Negative Declaration are subject to review and comment by responsible agencies and the
public at-large during a mandatory public review period (typically 30 days). Formal public notification
to adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration and the availability of the supporting documentation must be
provided to responsible agencies and the public. The District is required to respond to environmentally
relevant comments received during the public review period.

The governing board of the District will be responsible for ensuring that the environmental review and
documentation meet the requirements of CEQA and for the subsequent consideration and adoption of the
Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Hillsdale High School New Classroom Building L Project.
Should the District decide to approve and carry out the project for which the Mitigated Negative
Declaration has been adopted, the District will be required to file a "Notice of Determination" for posting
by the County Clerk and the California Office of Planning and Research (a.k.a. the State Clearinghouse).
The filing of the notice and its posting starts a 30-day statute of limitations on court challenges to the
approval of the project under CEQA.

II.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

REGIONAL LOCATION

Located in the central part of the San Francisco Peninsula, the City of San Mateo (City) is situated in the
east-central portion of San Mateo County (Figure 1). The community is a major center for government
services, commerce, education, residences, and recreation within the County. The year 2010 population
for the City was 97,207 (www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/sanmateo.htm), with projected 2015 and 2020
figures of 108,500 and 114,100 (Association ofBay Area Governments, 2007 Projections).

The cities of Hillsborough and Burlingame are situated to the west and north while the communities of
Belmont, San Carlos, and Redwood City are adjacent to the south and southeast. Foster City and San
Francisco Bay delineate the eastern boundary of the City. Crystal Springs Reservoir, which provides
storage for much ofthe City of San Francisco water supply, and the San Francisco State Fish and Game
Refuge lie further to the west of San Mateo.

The primary highways that provide north-south access to the City are U.S. Highway 101, State Route 82
(El Camino Real), and Interstate 280 west of the City. State Route 92 serves as a major east-west
arterial. The City is crisscrossed by an extensive network of surface streets.


PROJECT SITE LOCATION AND EXISTING CHARACTER

The following includes a description of the existing overall high school site, followed by the specific
character of the proposed project area.

Hillsdale High School Site

One of six high schools within the District, Hillsdale High School serves students within the southern
portion of the District's attendance area. The existing campus currently provides educational facilities
for about 1, I 00 pupils in grades 9 through 12.

The high school-- where the proposed project-a new classroom addition and associated facilities would
be constructed--is situated on an approximately 35.4-acre site in the southwestern corner of the City of
San Mateo (Figure 2). The campus is located at 3115 Del Monte Street, a two-lane, two-way street.

Other roadways include 31st Street, which delineates the north-northwest boundary of the campus, and
Alameda de las Pulgas on the east-northeast side. The backs of residences along the north side of West
Hillsdale Boulevard are contiguous to the south-southeastern of the school. Del Monte Street serves as
the major vehicle access with separate driveways for ingress and egress. Additional entries are located
from 31st Street and from Alameda de las Pulgas near its intersection with West Hillsdale Boulevard.

The facilities are comprised of several permanent buildings located in the west-northwest part of the
campus (Figure 3). Within the western part of the academic/administrative core, they include a two-story

split-level student services and administrative operations building immediately east of the faculty/visitor
parking area along with two adjacent academic structures that face each other across an open walkway.
Other buildings consist of a theater and cafeteria, shops and a boiler, a music facility and auditorium,
boys' and girls' gymnasiums, and a small pre-school facility. The current buildings of the high school
comprise approximately 150,000 square feet.

Athletic facilities are located along the southern and eastern portions of the campus. They consist of
hardcourt areas (e.g., basketball, tennis courts) and a softball field along the southern perimeter of the
site. The baseball field and the football field, with a running track, comprise much of the eastern half of
the high school.

On-site parking areas include the western lot with 67 spaces off Del Monte Street for faculty and visitor
parking, the north parking lot from 31st A venue with 82 spaces, and the southeast parking lot off Alameda
de las Pulgas with 133 spaces. A vacant paved area, west of the softball field and accessible from the
internal emergency/fire lane leading down from the ingress driveway on Del Monte Street, provides
parking varying from 54 to 68 spaces. Approximately 20 spaces are also available along this roadway.

Proposed Project Site - Existing Conditions

The existing site of the proposed project would consist of approximately 3.5 acres in the southwest
comer of the high school (Figure 3). Its eastern boundary is adjacent to the softball field. The south-
southwestern portion, which parallels the perimeter of the school property, is set back as close as about
40 feet from several nearby single-family residences. The south-southwestern portion of the site
includes an area of grass-covered fields and mature landscape trees, composed primarily of eucalyptus,
that slopes downhill from the residences to a relatively flat vacant area that is paved. The fire lane,
which splits off from the Del Monte Street entry, winds down the slope and turns northeast to roughly
parallel the southern perimeter of the present academic/administrative building core. Several metal
storage containers are located south of the fire lane along with a paved lot used for "overflow" parking.
In the level area north of the fire lane and south of Building I (in Zone C of the academic/administrative
core), facilities include an existing playground, several rows of mature eucalyptus trees and a lawn area.

Drainage generally flows from the southwest and south toward the north and east. The elevation of the
site ranges from approximately 130 feet mean sea level (msl) at Del Monte Street to about 115 feet at the
northeast comer of the site (U.S. Geologic Survey, San Mateo, CA [7.5 minute quadrangle], 1997).

The Vision 2030 City ofSan Mateo General Plan (Resolution No. 134-2010, adoptedl0-18-10; amended
4-18-11) land use map designation ofthe high school site is "Public Facility." The zoning is "One-Family
Dwelling" (RI-B).

Land uses adjacent to the approximately 3.5-acre proposed project site includes the remaining high
school campus. Six single-family residences are located in proximity to the southwestern-southern
boundaries of the site. The current General Plan designation for the nearby residences is "Single-
Family" and the zoning classification is "R-1 District" (One-Family Dwelling). The San Mateo County
Assessor's parcel number (APN) is 039-410-010.

PROJECT SPONSOR'S OBJECTIVES

The San Mateo Union High School District's primary objective for implementing the proposed new
classroom addition project would be the provision of adequate educational facilities to accommodate an
increase in the number of students that are expected to enroll at the campus in coming years. According
to recent growth forecasts prepared by the District that are consistent with California Department of
Education criteria (including, but not limited to, economic growth within the community and
demographics), an additional375attendees have been projected.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The implementation of the proposed project would include site preparation activities, followed by the
development of the proposed new classroom addition and associated facilities.

As part of the schedule, plans have been reviewed and approved by the Division of the State Architect for
mandatory review and approval. Construction ofthe project, which would take approximately 12-14
months from start to finish, would be initiated during late-spring/early summer 2015, with completion
projected for the early Summer 2016 and opening thereafter for the fall semester.

The project would be funded by local general obligation bond money. No State monies would be
involved.

The following provides a more detailed description of the major components of the proposed project.

Operation

The proposed project would add a maximum of375 students to the current high school enrollment of
1,100. Another 16 employees would be hired to staff the new facilities. School hours, including a
daycare, would run from approximately 7:00a.m. to 4:00p.m. Monday through Friday (excluding
holidays).

Facilities

New Classroom Building L

The new Classroom Building L would be constructed south of the existing Building I classroom. The
project would consist of a two-story structure with a maximum of about 30,000 square feet (Figure 4,
indicates approximate footprint). The facility would house 14 classrooms composed of ten science labs
and ten standard classrooms.

An existing daycare facility, attended by about 20 students in grades 2 through 4, would be relocated
from the present academic/administrative core to the southwest corner of the new building. An

                                                                                            Project Description


associated outdoor play yard and turf area would be provided adjacent to the day care and near the
proposed realignment ofthe fire lane (described in the "Circulation and Parking" section, below).

The maximum height of the new building would range from 32.5 to 34.0 feet (Figure 5). The facility
would be composed of concrete and cement plaster, steel, and glass to generally match the design of the
existing campus buildings. An interior elevator, along with access from exterior entries would be
provided. A security system would be installed.

The design of the new structure would reduce both energy and water use. Building materials, walls and
insulation would be selected to lower energy requirements. Dual glazed windows and insulated walls
would be installed. The heating and cooling of the classroom addition would be tied to the existing on-
site chiller yard and boiler room. Restroom appurtenances would be selected to conserve water and
lower flows. Sprinkler systems would be installed in the building to enhance fire protection. The
project would conform with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements (travel paths, ramps, elevator,
signage).

Exterior light around the new structure would be reduced to the extent practicable and feasible and, at the
same time, provide adequate illumination for safety and security. The height of any required lighting
posts or fixtures on the building would be kept to a minimum and any outdoor lamps would be controlled
by shielding to more efficiently direct the light and to control the potential occurrence of off-site glare.
To facilitate pedestrian use, low-level illumination, including low bollard fixtures, would be installed
throughout the exterior of the classroom building and nearby walkways. The lighting would be
controlled by timers that would allow lighting to come on when darkness occurs. Most lights (other than
those for safety and security) would be turned off at an appropriate time in the evening to save energy
and further minimize light from the campus.

Internal Circulation and Parking

The existing fire lane/emergency entry from Del Monte Street would be realigned to make way for the
new classroom building. The road would be relocated so that it would parallel the southwest perimeter
of the campus with a setback ranging from approximately 30 to about 50 feet (with a short segment near
the entry to the parking lot and several parking spaces as close as about 20 feet) from the fencing that
separates the high school from the property line of several nearby residences. The two-lane roadway
would connect with the paved lot, that is currently used for "overflow" parking, and continue around to
link with existing segments of the on-site emergency/fire lane.

The present paved lot would be improved with resurfacing, striping, and signage. The facility would
accommodate over 60 vehicles coming from the entry driveway at Del Monte Street. A pedestrian
walkway with a ramp and stairs would be provided from the parking lot to the new classroom addition
and other facilities within the campus. A new walkway and courtyard area would also be constructed
between Building 1 and the north side of new Building L. Low-level lighting would be installed in the
lot and walkways for safety and security.

Landscaping

Approximately 47 trees, comprised mostly of mature non-native eucalyptus and several smaller pine

trees, and other existing landscaping (e.g.,lawn and shrubs) would need to be removed to make way for
the new building, associated facilities, and fire lane realignment and to enhance safety (e.g., risk from fire
and falling debris). The trees are located south of existing Building 1 in the academic/administrative
core and along the western perimeter of the "overflow" parking lot (Figure 5). Trees in the setback area
between the edge of the realigned fire/emergency road and the backs ofthe several residences would be
retained to the extent practicable and restored and protected. In addition, several existing oak trees
would remain and be protected while up to another nine current oak trees within the project site would be
relocated to nearby areas. To offset trees that would removed, replacement trees of varying size would
be planted in and around the new building and parking lot. Tree species would consist of coast live oak,
red leaf maple, Japanese maple, and crape myrtle. Shrubs and groundcover would include, but not
limited to, manzanita, ceanothus, and various species of rushes, grasses and ferns along with turf.

Consistent with California Government Code Section 53904, the District, through its Board of Trustees,
has exempted itself (resolution of October 23, 2014) from local zoning ordinances that include, but are
not limited to, the removal of trees. However, the selection of new trees would be generally consistent
with City landscape design guidelines. Species would be drought-tolerant and minimize the need for
water. Landscape irrigation and watering would use automatic timers to lessen evaporation.

Infrastructure

As an existing high school site, the new classroom facilities would continue to use present infrastructure
connections and services. The site would be graded so that storm drainage within the area would
continue to be collected by City drainage lines. The California Water Service Company would supply
potable water while the City of San Mateo would provide wastewater collection and treatment.

To address the increase in impervious surface from the proposed project and to meet local and State post-
construction requirements and Best Management Practices (BMPs), C.3 measures for stormwater
management would be incorporated into the project for the collection, treatment and detention of on-site
runoff through the use of site design, source control, and treatment. Measures would consist of, but
would not be limited to, flow-through surfaces (including three bioswale areas), tree well filters, natural
self-treating turf (biofiltration sod), and landscaping areas. The rate of off-site storm water discharge
would be regulated so that the proposed project peak runoff quantity would not exceed pre-project levels.

Solid waste disposal would be furnished by Recology of San Mateo through franchise agreements
already in-place. Consistent with State Assembly Bill 939 for solid waste reduction and recovery, the
District would maintain recycling and solid waste minimization measures for operation of the new
facilities as part of an ongoing District-wide program.

For landscaping and building maintenance, limited amounts of materials, such as cleaning solvents,
fertilizers and herbicides, would be used within the project site. In addition, relatively small quantities of
chemicals would be used in the new science labs. As part of its ongoing program, the District would
provide ongoing management of these substances in accordance with manufacturers' requirements and to
minimize the amounts that would be used to the extent practicable.

Design, Site Preparation and Construction

As part of the proposed project, detailed design plans have been prepared. The plans would be consistent
with the Division of the State Architect, State Department of Education criteria, and the California

2014), Cleary Consultants, Inc., employed by the District, concluded that the development of the
proposed new classroom building and associated facilities would be geotechnically feasible by
implementing that recommendations from the preliminary review are implemented.

To ensure that structural requirements of the California Education Code are met for school facilities, the
District has incorporated applicable findings and recommendations from the geologic investigation into
the design plans submitted to the Division of the State Architect. Measures would include, but not be
limited to, the following: site preparation and grading procedures such as the removal of foundations,
concrete slabs, vegetation, topsoil, and utility lines; chemical treatment and compaction of soils and use
of proper fill materials; use of conventional spread/strip footings with a concrete slab-on- grade floor;
employment of retaining walls to resist lateral earth pressures from adjoining natural materials and
backfills; import of non-expansive engineered soils or mixing of quick lime with existing soils; and
installation of drainage facilities to channel water away from foundations and structures and avoidance of
erosion. Qualified geotechnical staff would provide monitoring of soils and foundation work and testing
during construction.

Site grading would be relatively minimal and would consist of minor cuts and fills with resulting slopes
of no more than 2:1 (horizontal to vertical). Proposed grading would maintain existing drainage patterns
and provide for natural overland discharge points. No substantial topographical changes have been
proposed or would occur within the present high school site.

The new structures would include earthquake-resistant construction to minimize the potential damage
from any potential seismic events that may occur within the region. Interior fixtures (e.g., lights, high
shelving) would be attached to maximize safety during seismic events. The proposed project would also
meet regulations (e.g., fire lane, emergency access, fire-resistant materials, water pressure and hydrants)
set forth for public schools by the State Fire Marshall. As described earlier, fire sprinklers would be
installed in each of the new buildings. The structures would also conform with current standards and
design for energy-efficient insulation, lighting, and heating and cooling. Exterior materials would be
selected to reflect heat.

As required, an encroachment permit would be obtained from the City for any project-related work that
would be performed outside the boundaries of the school site.

Site Preparation and Construction

Construction activities would involve excavation, grading, and facilities development that would require
the use of equipment such as excavators, backhoes, graders, dump trucks, loaders, compactors, dozers,
pavers, concrete trucks, and other heavy machinery. A crane would be utilized for erecting the steel

structure and for loading of materials. The heavier equipment would give way after the first several
months to smaller machinery (grade ails and bobcats) for the remainder of construction activities.

The staging and construction storage area would be located at the existing "overflow" parking lot. To
minimize potential environmental impacts during construction, measures ( part of standard site
preparation and construction practices) would be incorporated into the proposed project. They include
the following:

Erosion Control and Water Quality

The District would obtain a "General Construction Activity Stormwater Permit" to conform with
Regional Water Quality Control Board requirements for projects where one or more acres are disturbed.
Nevertheless, consistent with the conditions of the permit, Best Management Practices (BMPs) would be
used to control possible erosion and sedimentation and to maintain water quality. These measures could
include, but not be limited to, the use of temporary detention basins, the placement of hay bales for
reducing siltation from any site runoff, timely covering of construction areas, periodic sweeping to
remove soil from construction activities, and restriction of grading to the dry season. Landscaping for
the project, including trees and shrubs, would be planted shortly after site preparation and during
construction to further minimize the possibility of erosion.

Consistent with local and State requirements, the District would prepare a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Program (SWPPP) to protect water quality on-site and within the watershed and coordinate its
efforts with the City and San Mateo County. Measures could consist of, but not be limited to, education
of staff and maintenance personnel to practice good housekeeping activities (e.g., immediate clean-up
of any spills with absorbent materials and subsequent proper disposal, weekly collection of litter from the
construction site area, periodic vacuum cleaning of hardscape surfaces (e.g., parking lot and internal
roadways) and inlets prior to, and immediately after the rainy season, and continued management for the
use of materials such as fertilizers and pesticides. The SWPPP would be periodically evaluated and and
monitored as required by applicable regulations.

Control ofAir Emissions

To minimize air quality impacts to the lowest practicable levels consistent with Bay Area Air Quality
Management District (BAAQMD) guidelines, Best Available Control Technologies (BACTs) would be
employed to maintain the tune of construction equipment, lessening engine idling along with possible
use of electrical power in lieu of gasoline or diesel-driven equipment. Dust (particulate matter), and to a
lesser extent, other air emissions, would be controlled by implementing the followings: (I) preparing and
adopting a comprehensive construction activity management plan to most effectively use construction
equipment and assure it is properly maintained; (2) periodically watering, sprinkling or treating any soils
piles and unpaved site grading to prevent airborne dust from leaving the property and increased watering
whenever wind speeds exceed 15 miles per hour; (3) covering or watering all excavated materials
transported off-site; (4) limiting on-site vehicle speeds; ( 5) removing mud and soils from the tires of
equipment before leaving the site; (5) planting new and replacement landscaping as soon as possible
after initiation of project construction; and (7) sweeping adjacent streets as needed to remove dirt.

Noise Controls

To reduce potential noise-related impacts from site preparation and construction activities, the District
would observe construction times (7:00a.m. to 7:00p.m. Monday through Friday; Saturday 9:00a.m. to
5 p.m.; Sundays 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.) generally consistent with the City of San Mateo Noise Ordinance
(Chapter 7.30.060). The District, as an agency of the State, is exempt from the general time frames for
local noise ordinances associated with construction activities (in addition to exempting itself by District
Board of Trustees action On October 23, 2014). Measures to minimize noise would include the
following: ( 1) muffling or control of any loud construction equipment; (2) set back procedures with the
highest noise potential away from any nearby residences; (3) perform noisy procedures at an off-site
location as practicable; (4) schedule construction, as feasible, so that the shell of the structure can be
partially finished for use as a noise buffer; and (5) notify nearby residents beforehand of particularly
noisy construction activities. In addition, the District would notify neighbors in the event that work is
scheduled outside of its usual work hours or days. School buildings would be insulated to meet State
requirements for internal noise (45 decibels).

Health and Safety Measures

Site preparation and construction activities would be conducted consistent with Occupational Health and
Safety Administration (OSHA) and CalOSHA regulations and local requirements to provide for worker
and public safety. To protect the general public, as applicable, the proposed building area would be
fenced and signed and other appropriate measures taken to restrict public access. Applicable regulatory
and cautionary signage (and personnel if required) in the construction area would be installed and traffic
controls, as appropriate, would be implemented. When utility/service lines are to be connected, the
appropriate agency would be notified and in-place procedures would be followed to protect/relocate any
affected utilities. Off-site transport of materials deemed hazardous would be managed in accordance
with applicable local, state and federal regulatory requirements.

A previous investigation was conducted by Kleinfelder, Inc. to evaluate the potential presence of on-site
hazardous materials at the high school in 2001. The PEA was followed by a remediation program to
address lead from paint, asbestos and asbestos-containing materials and polychlorinated biphenols found
to exist and their disposal in accordance with regulatory requirements and oversight by the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) (Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study- Hillsdale High
School- New Student Services Building and Modernization, April2003)Kleinfelder, Inc. Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment Report, Hillsdale High School, 3115 Del Monte Street, San Mateo, CA,
September 21, 2001).

The proposed project would be not be subject to further evaluation by the DTSC. No State monies
would be used for the construction of the new classroom addition.

Protection of Remaining Landscaping

During construction, strict tree protection measures (e.g., sufficient setback from root systems, temporary
fencing) would be implemented as part of the proposed project to avoid damage to remaining trees in
proximity to site preparation activities. The District would retain an arborist to assess the existing trees
and develop the tree protection plan.

Protection ofPotential Cultural Resources

A previous evaluation for the presence of potential cultural resources was conducted in 2002 by LSA
Associates, a firm specializing in the evaluation of cultural resources. No evidence of cultural resources
were found at the site.

To further ensure that site preparation and construction do not result in adverse effects on potential,
unknown cultural resources and consistent with regulations and accepted protocols to protect cultural
resources, a qualified cultural resource specialist(s) would be present during site preparation activities.
In the event that culturally significant materials is uncovered, work may be halted and appropriate
mitigation actions would be taken, consistent with the CEQA Guidelines and applicable federal
requirements. Measures may include, but not be limited to, provision of setbacks and avoidance of the
area until the extent of the impact and any subsequent procedures (e.g., excavation plan) can be identified
and implemented, development of specific protocols, and, as required, contact with the Native American
Heritage Commission (Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study - Hillsdale High School - New Student
Services Building and Modernization, April 2003) Kleinfelder, Inc. Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment Report, Hillsdale High School, 3115 Del Monte Street, San Mateo, CA, September 21, 2001 ).

DETERMINATION

On the basis ofthis initial evaluation:

    I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and a NEGATIVE
    DECLARATION will be prepared.

X I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there will not be a
  significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been made or agreed to by the project
  proponent. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

    I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an ENVIRONMENTAL
    IMPACT REPORT is required.

    I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or potentially significant unless
    mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one effect 1) has been adequately analyzed in an earlier
    document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and 2) has been addressed by mitigation measures based on the
    earlier analysis as described on attached sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but
    it must analyze only the effects that remain to be addressed.

    I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, because all
    potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earlier ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
    REPORT or NEGATIVE DECLARATION, pursuant to applicable standards and (b) have been avoided or
    mitigated pursuant to that earlier ENVIRONMENTAL IMP ACT REPORT OR NEGATIVE DECLARATION,
    including revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed upon the proposed project.

   EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

   I) A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are
      adequately supported by the information sources a lead agency cites in the parenthesis
      following each question. A "No Impact" answer is adequately supported if the referenced
      information sources show that the impact simply does not apply to a project like the one
      involved (e.g., the project falls outside a fault rupture zone). A "No Impact" answer should
      be explained where it is based on project-specific facrors as well as general standards (e.g.,
      the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on a project-specific
      screening analysis).

  2) All answers must rake account of the whole action involved, including off-site as well as on-
     site, cumulative as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as well as
     operational impacts.

  3) Once the lead agency has detcnnined that a particular impact may occur, then the checklist
     answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant, less than significant with
     mitigation, or less than significant. "Potentially Significant £mpact" is one or more
     "Potentially Significant Impact" entries when the determination is made, an EIR is required.

  4) "Negative Declaration: Less Than Significant With Mitigation lncorporated" applies where
     the incorporation of mitigation measures has reduced an effect from "Potentially Significant
     Impact" to a "Less than Significant Impact." The lead agency must describe the mitigation
     measures, and briefly explain how they reduce the effect to a less than significant level
     {mitigation measures from Section XVIJ, "Earlier Analysis," may be cross-referenced).

  5) Earlier analyses may be used where, pursuant to the tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA
     process, an effect has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration
     Section 15063 (c)(3)(D). In this case, a brief discussion should identify the following:
     a) Earlier Analysis Used. Identify and state where they are available for review.
     b) Impacts Adequately Addressed. Identify which effects from the above checklist were
        within the scope of and adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable
        legal standards, and state whether such effects were addressed by mitiga[ion measures

                      based on the earlier analysis.

                  c) Mitigation Measures. For effects that are "Less than Significant with Mitigation Measures
                     Incorporated," describe the mitigation measures which were incorporated or refined from
                     the earlier document and the extent to which they address site-specific conditions for the
                     project.

            6) Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information
               sources for potential impacts (e.g., general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a
               previously prepared or outside document should, where appropriate, include a reference to
               the page or pages where the statement is substantiated.

            7) Supporting Information Sources: A source list should be attached, and other sources used or
               individuals contacted should be cited in the discussion.

            8) This is only a suggested form, and lead agencies are free to use different formats; however,
               lead agencies should normally address the questions from this checklist that are relevant to a
               project's environmental effects in whatever format is selected.

            9) The explanation of each issue should identify:

                  a) the significance criteria or threshold, if any, used to evaluate each question; and
                  b) the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the impact to less
                  than significance.

II. AGRICULTURE RESOURCES: In determining whether impacts to agricultural
      resources are significant environmental effects, lead agencies may refer to the
     California Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment Model (I 997) prepared
     by the California Department of Conservation as an optional model to use in assessing
     impacts on agriculture and farmland. In determining whether impacts to forest resource,
    including timberland, are significant environmental effects, lead agencies may refer to

     proposing new homes and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extension of
     roads or other infrastructure)?

  b) Displace substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of
     replacement housing elsewhere?


  c) Displace substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement
     housing elsewhere?


XIV. PUBLIC SERVICES

  a) Would the project result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the
     provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or

IV. RESPONSES TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST FORM
The following explanations are presented in response to the items contained in Chapter III, CEQA
Environmental Checklist Form. The explanations are keyed to the corresponding number and letter of
the topic presented in the checklist. The discussion contained in the responses are predicated upon
information and judgements from the lead agency. Criteria to define the level of impact upon
environmental resources have been set forth. The significance criteria has been based upon quantitative
thresholds (e.g., noise levels) where applicable, professional judgements as deemed appropriate and
necessary by CEQA., and standards that have become commonly accepted as part of the preparation of
CEQA documentation. In accordance with CEQA, " ..... a significant impact is a substantial, or
potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
project." As appropriate and applicable, a reference or source for supportive information has been cited
within the response for each topic.

L AESTHETICS

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista, resulting in the obstruction of any scenic view or
   vista open to the public?
b) substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and
    historic buildings within a state scenic highway?
c) substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surrounding?
d) create a new source of substantia/light or glare which would adversely affect day or nighttime
   views in the area. Sources could include those that would directly illuminate or reflect upon
   acijacent property or could be directly seen by motorists or persons residing, working or otherwise
   situated within sight of the project. The significance level may be determined by the intensity of the
   lighting?

The City ofSan Mateo does not have a visual resources ordinance. Ordinances relevant to visual
effects associated with buildings and construction (Title 23 of the "San Mateo City Charter and
Municipal Code'') are set forth for buildings and accessory structure and architectural controls. The
school district has exempted itselffrom the City's zoning ordinances through action taken by the
District's Board ofTrustees at their regular meeting of October 23, 2014).

a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?

Less Than Significant Impact. Implementation of the proposed project would not have a significant
impact on a scenic vista from view locations around the project site. Currently, views of, and sight lines
across, the southwestern portion of the campus--where the proposed facilities would be located-- are
limited to residents and travelers along the southern part of Del Monte Street on the school frontage and,
to a lesser extent, residents of six single-family dwellings on West Hillsdale Boulevard. Obscured by
mature eucalyptus trees near Del Monte Street, other trees in and around the "overflow" parking area,

and perimeter fencing at the backs of residences, these views include other high school facilities,
residential and other urban development, and the distant hills to the east. Residents living adjacent to
the southwest boundary of the project site would have very limited views from back yards. Existing
fences that range from five feet (plus an additional one foot oflattice work)to eight-feet high and
intervening trees located within residential backyards and along the school side ofthe boundary
perimeter would preclude any substantive views or scenic vistas.

No other view locations of significance occur within the area. Views of, or across the project site from
the northern part of Del Monte Street and 31st Street are blocked by existing school buildings and trees.
Features visible from Alameda de las Pulgas are not readily discernible due to intervening facilities,
fencing, and trees.

The proposed facilities would be developed within the existing high school and they would be
consistent with the current uses at the high school. The new classroom addition would be located within
a relatively flat area south of the existing academic/administrative core and the scale of the
development, including the design and height, would be similar to the current facilities. Trees to be
removed would be replaced and about nine to ten existing oak trees would be relocated in the project
area. Trees within the area between the southwest perimeter fence and the edge of the realigned
fire/emergency road would be protected and restored during construction. No scenic vistas nor the
visual character of the area would be significantly affected by the development of the project.

h) Substantially damage scenic resources within a State scenic highway?

No Impact. No State-designated scenic highways are located adjacent to or in the vicinity of the project
site. The nearest State highway is Route 92 to the to the north and Route 82 to the east. No views of the
site are visible from either highway.

c) Substantially degrade existing visual character or quality?

Less Than Significant Impact. The existing visual character or quality of the site and current views
would not be substantially degraded. See the response to item La, above.

d) Create new sources of light or glare that would affect views in the area?

Less Than Significant Impact. Construction activities and future operation of the school would add light
and glare within the surrounding area. However, these new sources of light and glare would not
substantially affect views within the area of the proposed school project nor would they be they be
readily discernible from the residences along the south-southwest perimeter of the school. See the
response to item La, above. Visual impacts from construction (e.g., equipment, worker vehicles) would
be short-term and intermittent, limited generally to daylight hours, and would therefore not cause
significant effects.

During operation, the proposed project could result in light and glare from sources that include
reflections from new building surfaces and glass from the two-story structure and the increased use of
the "overflow" parking lot that currently exists at the project site. However, such light and glare would

be minimized to a less than significant level by the setbacks from adjacent streets, the existing fencing at
the residences, trees, and other vegetation, and the use of minimal low-level lighting for safety and
security that would be shielded to address off-site glare. Please also see the response to item La, above.

IL AGRICULTURE RESOURCES

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance as shown on the
    maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of the California
    Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?
b) conflict with existing agricultural zoning or a Williamson Act contract?
c) conflict with existing zoningfor or cause rezoning of, forest land (as defined in Public Resources
   Code section 122220(g), timberland (as defined by Public Resources Code section 4526), or
   timberland zoned Timberland Production (as defined by Government Code section 51104(g)?
d) result in the loss offorest land or conversion offorest land to non-forest use?
e) involve other changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could
   result in conversion of Farmland, to non-agricultural use or conversion offorest land to non-forest
   use?

a)   Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance?

No Impact. Located within an existing high school site in the City of San Mateo, implementation of the
proposed project would not involve any Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide
Importance.

b)   Conflict with existing agricultural zoning or a Williamson Act contract?

No Impact. The Williamson Act is not applicable to the site. See the response to item ll.a, above.

c) Conflict with existing zoning or cause rezoning offorest land or Timberland Production?

No Impact. There are no forest lands or timber production at the school site.

d) Loss or conversion offorest land to non-forest use?

No Impact. There are no forest lands or forestry activities at the school site.

e) Changes to environment leading to conversion of Farmland or forest land to non-agricultural
   use?

No Impact. There are no farmlands or forest lands at the school site.

IlL    AIR QUALITY

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) conflict with or obstruct implementation ofthe applicable air quality plan?
b) violate any air quality standard or contributes substantially to an existing or projected air quality
   violation?
c) result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollution for which the project
   region is nonattainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard
   (including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors?
d) exposes sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations?
e) create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number ofpeople?

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) has developed significance thresholds
criteria for operational-related air emissions and precursors under its CEQA Guidelines (updated May
2011). They include:

•   Reactive Organic Compounds (ROG) - 10 tons/year or 54 pounds/day.
•   Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) - 10 tons/year or 54 pounds/day.
•   Particulate matter (PM1 0) - 15 tons/year or 82 pounds/day.
•   Fine particulate matter (P M2. 5) - 10 tons/year or 54 pounds/day.
•   Local Carbon Monoxide (CO) - nine parts per million (eight-hour average); 20.0 ppm (one-hour
    average)

In addition, the BAAQMD has established CEQA significance threshold criteria for construction-
related air pollutants and precursors that include daily average emissions for ROG, NOx and PM2.5 of
54 pounds/day and 82 pounds/day for PM1 0.

The BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines also identify the kinds of land uses that may lead to exceedance of
significant threshold levels for specific operational emissions. Examples under the operational criteria
screening size include: 325 new single-family housing units (NOx); general office building of 346,000
square feet (NOx); an elementary school with 2, 747students (ROG) or 271 square feet (NOx); and a
two-year community college with either 152,000 square feet of developed floor area or 2,390 students
(NOx).

For construction-related activities, examples of development that would result in significant levels of
ROG include: 114 single-family residences; general office building of 2 77, 000 square feet; an
elementary school with 3,904 students or 277,000 square feet; and a two-year community college with
either 3,261 students or 277,000 square feet.

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) has developed significance thresholds for
air emissions under CEQA Guidelines. They include:

                                                                                 Responses to Environmenttal Checklist



• Reactive Organic Compounds (ROG) - 15 tons/year or 80 pounds/day.
• Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) - 15 tons/year or 80 pounds/day.
• Fine particulate matter (PM1 0) - 15 tons/year or 80 pounds/day.
• Carbon Monoxide (CO)- 550 pounds/day.

 The BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines also identify the kinds of development that may lead to significant
levels of operational emissions. Examples include approximately 375 new single-family housing
units, general office development of 305,000 square feet, or a community college with 345,000 square
feet ofdeveloped floor area.

a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of applicable air quality plan?

No Impact. The proposed project would not conflict with or obstruction implementation of the regional
air quality plan. It would result in short-term emission of particulates and other contaminants from
preparation of the site and construction along with a relatively small quantity of other pollutants (e.g.,
carbon monoxide [CO], reactive organic gases [ROG] and nitrogen oxides [NOx] which are ozone
precursors) from construction equipment. To minimize the local impacts from site preparation and
construction activities, Best Management Practices (BMPs) for dust suppression and Best Available
Control Technologies (BACTs) for combustion engine emissions control have been incorporated as part
of the proposed project (see Chapter II, Project Description). Incorporation of these measures would be
consistent with BAAQMD guidelines that constitute part of the applicable air quality plan. In addition,
the project would be designed so that lighting and cooling and heating equipment (i.e., chilling room
and boiler), that is already in-place and connected to the new building, would be energy and
environmentally efficient in accordance with State building codes and other relevant standards.
Furthermore, a number of students would walk or bicycle to the campus which would help lessen
potential air emissions.

b) Violate any air quality standard or contribute to an existing or project air quality violation?

Less Than Significant Impact. Given the project scale and its duration of construction, daily
significance thresholds for criteria emissions that include ROG (of which ozone is a constituent), NOx,
CO, sulphur oxides [SOx], and PMl 0 would not be exceeded during either construction activities or the
operation of the new classroom and associated facilities. The scale ofthe proposed project falls well
below the kinds of development that would be expected to generate significant levels of elevated air
emissions. Furthermore, the design of the project (e.g., efficient and low-energy lighting, connection to
existing heating and cooling facilities) would minimize contributions to regional air emissions.

During the relatively short-term of construction, a relatively small quantity of pollutants would occur
from the use of construction equipment and site preparation. To minimize the local impacts from
construction activities, measures for dust suppression and combustion engine emissions control have
been incorporated as part of the proposed project. Potentially adverse effects during site preparation
and construction would be less than significant with incorporation of these measures and Best Available
Control Technologies (BACTs).

c) Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the region
   is in non-attainment?

Less Than Significant Impact. The proposed project would result in a relatively minor increase in air
emissions associated with construction. No other net increase in the cumulative level of any criteria
pollutant (i.e., particulates, ozone) for which the region is in nonattainment would occur. See also the
response to items III. a and b, above.

d) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations?

Less Than Significant Impact. There are no hospitals, senior facilities or similar sensitive receptor
locations in the immediate vicinity. On-site construction would expose nearby residents to potential
emissions generated by associated activities (i.e., particulates from site preparation and low levels of
ROG, NOx and CO from equipment). However, because of the relatively short duration and
intermittent nature of construction and measures incorporated into the project to control particulates and
other emissions to the extent practicable, pollutant concentrations would not be substantial and potential
impacts would be less than significant.

e) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number ofpeople?

Less Than Significant Impact. There may be some objectionable odors from the operation of diesel-
powered equipment during construction of the proposed facilities at the school site. However, these
odors would be limited to the short-term construction period of the project and would not be significant.
Future operation of the new facilities would not result in objectionable odors.

IV. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or indirectly, or through habitat modifications, on
   any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local/regional plans,
   policies,or regulations, or by the California Department ofFish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service or any species protected under provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act?
b) have a substantial effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in
   local or regional plans, policies, or regulations or by the agencies above?
c) have a substantial effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean
   Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal,
  filling, hydrological interruption, or other means?
d) interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory wildlife species or with
   established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede use of native wildlife nursery
   sites?
e) conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree
   preservation policy or ordinance?

f) Conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community
   Conservation Plan, or other approved habitat conservation plan?

a) Effect on candidate, sensitive, or special status species?

No Impact. The proposed project site would be located within an already existing school site. The
present 1,100-student campus is surrounded by urban uses that include single-family residences and city
streets.

b) Substantial effect on any sensitive natural communities?

No Impact. See the response to item IV.a, above.

c) Substantial effect upon federally protected wetlands under Section 404?

No Impact. No wetland areas are present on the project site. See the response to item IV.a, above.

d) Inteifere with movement or migratory corridors of native residents or migratory species, or use of
   native wildlife nursery sites?

No Impact. See the response to item IV.a, above. The proposed project site is located within an
existing 1,1 00-student high school that is surrounded by single family residences and public streets.
The new facilities would not interfere with the movement or migratory corridors of native residents or
migratory species or serve as native wildlife nursery sites.

e) Conflict with any local policies/ordinances for protection of biological resources?

No Impact. See the response to item IV.a, above. There are no known local policies or ordinances for
the protection of biological resources that are applicable to the proposed project and there are no unique
or sensitive habitats within the property. The District has exempted itself (District Board of Trustees
action of October 23,2014 consistent with State Government Code, Section 53904) from the City's
ordinances, including the protection ofheritage trees (Chapter 13.24).

f)   Conflict with Habitat Conservation Plan or other approved conservation plan?

No Impact. There are no Habitat Conservation Plan or other approved conservation plan that are
applicable to the site or the project. See the response to item IV.a, above.

V. CULTURAL RESOURCES

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) cause a substantial change in the significance of a historical or resource as defined in §15064.5?


                                                    33
                                                                                  Responses to Environmenttal Checklist



b) cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to
   §15064.5?
c) directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource, site or unique geologica/feature?
d) disturb any human remains, including those interred outside offormal cemeteries?

a) Substantial effect upon historical resource?

No Impact. Based upon an earlier on-site survey and research conducted by LSA Associates, Inc. (a
qualified cultural resources firm) for the construction of an earlier student services building and
modernization project in 2003at the high school, the implementation of the proposed project would not
affect any historical resources listed on the National Register of Historical Resources, or that are locally
designated. A records search was completed in September 2002 at the Northwest Information Center of
the State of California Historical Resources Information System along with consultation with the Native
American Commission, the San Mateo County Historical Association and Museum. In addition, a field
survey did not identify any historical resources within or adjacent to the Hillsdale High School campus
(Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study - Hillsdale High School New Student Services Building and
Modernization, April2003) nor were any such cultural resources uncovered during the subsequent
construction of the student services building.

For the new classroom addition project, no potentially historic facilities on the site would be affected
nor any current structures removed or altered. To further ensure that there would be no substantial
effects upon any potentially historical or other cultural resources, measures (e.g., presence of a qualified
cultural resource specialist during site preparation activities) have been incorporated as part of the
proposed project to address any potential impacts.

h) Substantial effect upon an archaeological resource?

No Impact. See the response to item V.a, above. The scope ofthe on-site survey and research
conducted by LSA Associates, Inc. for the presence of historical resources also included consideration
of archaeological resources.

c) Destroy unique paleontological resource or site or unique geologic feature?

No Impact. Geologic and paleontological review was conducted in 2002 to assess the possibility of
encountering fossil resources and unique geologic features during construction activities within the
project area. A literature search did not identify paleontological resources or unique geologic features
within the project area. However, there was a possibility of encountering fossil-bearing Pleistocene
deposits and Franciscan Complex graywacke sandstone within the project area. Since Franciscan
Complex graywacke sandstone can contain marine invertebrate fossils, and Pleistocene deposits in the
San Francisco Bay Area are known to contain vertebrate faunas and freshwater invertebrate faunas,
paleontological resources could possibly be encountered during construction activities, though none
were uncovered during the 2003 construction of the earlier new student services building and
modernization project (Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study - Hillsdale High School New Student
Services Building and Modernization, April2003).

d) Disturb any human remains?

No Impact. Please see the response to item V.b, above.

VLGEOLOGYANDSOJLS

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) expose people or structures to potentially substantial adverse effects including the risk of loss,
   injury, or death involving: (i) rupture of a known earthquake fault as delineated on the most recent
   Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist; (ii) strong seismic
   groundshaking; (iii) seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction; and (iv) landslides?
b) result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil?
c) be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable or that would become unstable as a result of the
   project and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction
   or collapse?
d) be located on expansive soil, as defined by the Uniform Building Code, creating substantial risks to
   life or property?
e) have soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater
   disposal systems where sewers are not available for the disposal ofwastewater?

a) Expose people or structures to the following:

  i.   Rupture of a known earthquake fault as delineated by Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning
       Map or other substantial information?

No Impact. The proposed project site is not located within a State-designated Alquist-Priolo Fault-
Rupture Zone (formerly known as a Special Studies Zone), where a potential for major fault rupture
could occur (Cleary Consultants, Inc., Geotechnical Investigation - Two-story Classroom Building-
Hillsdale High School- San Mateo, California, March 2014).

  ii. Strong seismic shaking?

Less Than Significant Impact. The proposed site is situated within the San Francisco Bay Area, a region
where strong seismic groundshaking could occur during moderate to severe earthquakes, resulting in
potentially significant damage. In the vicinity of the project location, there are several major active
faults that generally trend in a northwesterly direction that are of significant concern for a major event.
They include the following that are within 25 miles of the proposed project site: (1) San Andreas, about
2.2 miles to the southwest with a maximum earthquake (moment magnitude) of 8.1; (2) Monta Vista,
around 7.3miles to the southwest with a maximum earthquake (moment magnitude) of 6.5; (3) San
Gregorio Connected, about 9.9 miles to the southwest with a maximum earthquake (moment magnitude)
of7.5; (4) Hayward, approximately 16.1 miles to the northeast with a maximum earthquake (moment
magnitude) of7.3; and (5) Calaveras, about 23.6 miles to the northeast with a maximum earthquake

                                                                                 Responses to Environment/a/ Checklist



(moment magnitude) of7.0 (Cleary Consultants, Inc., Geotechnical Investigation- Two-story
Classroom Building- Hillsdale High School- San Mateo, California, March 2014).

With mandatory conformance to the California Building Code (2010), design standards of the Division
of the State Architect for school construction and adoption of recommendations from the geotechnical
report by Cleary Consultants, Inc., it is expected that potential for damage to proposed structures from
seismic shaking would be reduced to a less than significant level. The new school facilities would be
structurally reinforced to withstand the projected maximum seismic event. Plans for the proposed
structures would be prepared consistent with the California Building Code and reviewed and approved
by the Division of the State Architect. Foundations would be constructed to withstand shaking from a
severe earthquake. Fixtures would be bolted to minimize possible injury from falling objects. ·

  iii. Seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction?

Less Than Significant Impact. Liquefaction typically occurs when soils that are loose, coarse and
saturated by water or groundwater lose strength and deform as a result of strong groundshaking.
According to the geotechnical investigation, the proposed two-story building site is underlain by
predominantly very stiff to hard sandy clay and silty and medium dense to very dense clayey sand to the
maximum depth of the exploration at 45 feet. Analysis of the materials indicated that the potential for
damage by earthquake-induced soil liquefaction is low along with a very low potential for ground
cracking (Cleary Consultants, Inc., Geotechnical Investigation- Two-story Classroom Building-
Hillsdale High School- San Mateo, California, March 2014). Project conformance with mandatory
building standards, along with associated review by the Division of the State Architect, would preclude
significant impacts resulting from potential seismic-related failure, including liquefaction .

  iv. Landslides?

Less Than Significant Impact. The project site topography ranges from approximately 130 feet near Del
Monte Street to about 115 feet (msl) to a relatively flat area where the new classroom building would be
located. The current landscaping, including around 4 7 trees, would be removed and the ground would
be disturbed, leading to possible slope instability and erosion.

According to the geotechnical report, part of the upper sand to silty clay soils and the old fill at the
project site are of variable consistency and strength, and are considered unsuitable for support of the
proposed building in their current condition. In addition, removal oftrees and root bulbs would result in
substantial disturbance of these soils along with further instability caused by wet conditions and
construction equipment loads. However, the report indicates that " .. .landsliding is also very unlikely to
occur at the site based on the relatively gentle topography and the predominantly very stiff to hard soil
strength encountered in the borings" (Cleary Consultants, Inc., Geotechnical Investigation- Two-story
Classroom Building- Hillsdale High School- San Mateo, California, March 2014).

As part of the measures incorporated into the project after the demolition work (e.g., old infrastructure
is taken out; removal of trees and old asphalt; unsuitable fills removed), the soils would be chemically
treated and allowed to dry, followed by placement of suitable engineered fill and compaction to stabilize
the site. Grading would be relatively minimal and cut slopes and any fill slopes would be no steeper

than 2: 1 (horizontal to vertical). Replacement trees and trees that would be relocated would be planted
as soon as practicable after the completion of site preparation. Retaining walls would be installed to
further stabilize the site. The new classroom building would be supported on conventional continuous
and isolated spread footings. Runoff would be channeled into closed pipes and discharged into
collection basins and surface collectors (Cleary Consultants, Inc., Geotechnical Investigation - Two-
story Classroom Building- Hillsdale High School- San Mateo, California, March 2014). The adequacy
of the site preparation work and required testing and monitoring would be provided by qualified
geotechnical staff and the District's project manager.

b) Result in soil erosion or the loss of topsoil?

Less Than Significant Impact. The implementation of the proposed project would not result in
significant soil erosion or the loss of topsoil. Much of the existing campus is already overcovered with
structures and paving along with facilities to channel and collect stormwater. During construction, soils
would be exposed and much of the present landscaping would be removed to make way for the new
facilities. Site preparation would result in approximately 4, 700 cubic yards of cut materials and 500
cubic yards of fill along with about 260 yards of imported fill. In addition, there would be an increase
of about 0.27 acre of impermeable area.

As part of the project, measures have been incorporated as part of the project to minimize soil erosion
and/or loss of topsoil. Consistent with sound construction practices and regulatory guidelines to be
included as part of the SWPPP to be prepared as part of the proposed project for Best Management
Practices (BMPs), measures would include, but would not be limited to, the utilization of hay bales for
reducing siltation from runoff, timely covering or landscaping, restricting grading to the dry season, and
street sweeping. With the development and operation of the new facilities, there would be minimal
impacts from soil erosion or loss of topsoil since affected areas would be overcovered by structures,
parking lots and landscaping and adequate drainage would be installed.

c) Located on unstable geologic unit or soil or such instability caused by project?

Less Than Significant Impact. See the responses to items Vl.a.ii, iii and iv, above, concerning unstable
geologic units and the characteristics of site soils.

d) Located on expansive soil as defined by the Uniform Building Code?

Less Than Significant Impact. According to the findings from the geotechnical review, stiff to very stiff
lean clays and sandy lean clays are present in load-bearing zones as well as moderately expansive clayey
soils at shallow depths below the ground surface. Generally, tests indicated that the near surface soils
were moderately plastic (soils that would result in differential compaction).

As part of the geotechnical recommendations incorporated into the proposed project, soils would be
compacted as part of site preparation along with the use of non-expansive engineered fill to ensure that
an adequate foundation would be established for the placement of foundations for the new structures.
Significant effects caused by potential expansive soils would not occur as part of the proposed project.

e) Soils incapable of adequately supporting septic tank or other non-sewer use?

No Impact. Wastewater from the new facilities would be collected by existing lines. Septic tanks or
other non-sewer systems would not be used.

VIL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact
   on the environment?
b) conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the
   emissions ofgreenhouse gases?

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District has authority over the reduction ofgreenhouse gases
(GHGs) within its jurisdiction. The BAAQMD has established thresholds of significance for
operational-related GHG emissions for various development projects including residential,
commerical, industrial and public land uses. The threshold is compliance with a qualified GHG
Reduction Strategy or annual emissions of less than 1,100 metric tons ofC02.

a)   Generate levels ofgreenhouse gas emissions that would have a significant effect?

Less Than Significant Impact. Implementation of the proposed development would not generate
greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), either directly or indirectly, in quantities that would have a
significant impact or result in noncompliance with the annual emission of GHGs. Based upon the
screening criteria, the new school would be well below the square footage and student attendance
threshold criteria.

Nothwithstanding, as part of the proposed project, the design of the school would employ design
measures to minimize energy needed for heating and cooling and water requirements. Heating and
cooling needs would be provided by connecting with the existing chiller room and boiler facilities. Use
of natural light, open space, and energy-efficient materials would be maximized. Low-flow
appurtenances would be installed in restrooms and drip irrigation for landscaping, which would be
selected for drought-resistance, would be used to reduce water requirements and associated energy from
pumping and transport. Efficient lighting would be provided for safety and security and shielded to
minimize off-site glare.

b)   Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulations for the reduction of greenhouse gases?

No Impact. The implementation of the proposed project would not conflict with any applicable plans,
policy or regulations for the reduction of greenhouse gases. See the response to item VILa, above. The
development of the educational facilities would be designed and operated to lessen the amount of

GHGs, that might otherwise be potentially generated, by adopting design measures and energy efficient
equipment to enhance and minimize energy use.

VIIL HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

 a) create a significant hazard to the public or environment by routine transport, use or disposal of
    hazardous materials?
 b) create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable upset
    and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment?
 c) emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste
     within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school?
 d) be located on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials site compiled pursuant to
     Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would create a significant hazard to the public or
    the environment?
 e) for a projected located in an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted,
     within two miles of a public airport or public use airport, would the project result in a safety hazard
    for people residing or working on the project site?
f) for a project within the vicinity ofprivate airstrip, would the project result in a safety hazard for
    people residing or working in the project area?
 g) impair implementation of or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or
    emergency evacuation plan?
 h) expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires,
     including where wildlands are are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed
    with wildlands?

a) Hazard from routine transport, use, and disposal of hazardous materials?

Less Than Significant Impact. Since the new facilities would not be funded by State monies, the
proposed project would not be subject to hazardous materials review and clearance from the California
Department of Education (CDE) and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) as
set forth in Section 17213 .1 et seq. Of the California Education Code.

As part of the environmental review (2001-2003) for the earlier new student services building and
modernization project at the high school, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) for the
presence of hazardous materials was completed by Kleinfelder, Inc. and reviewed by the DTSC. The
ESA included reconnaissance and observation of the project site and other nearby areas, including parts
of the currently proposed project location, a review of historical information about past activities and
uses, a review of regulatory information relevant to the campus and nearby properties, and soil sampling
for lead around existing buildings (Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study, Hillsdale High School New
Student Services Building and Modernization, April 2003).

                                                                                Responses to Environment/a/ Checklist



The results of the hazmat evaluation was summarized in the CEQA Initial Study for the earlier new
student services building project as follows:

   " ... Based on the ESA evaluation of the site conditions and the management and good housekeeping
   of the school facilities, there was no evidence to suggest that there has been an 'existing release'
   present at the site nor did the assessment reveal any evidence of recognized environmental
   conditions in connection with the property (Kleinfelder, Inc., Phase I Environmental Site
   Assessment Report, Hillsdale High School, 3115 Del Monte Street, San Mateo, California,
   September 21, 2001). Furthermore, from its review of the Phase I ESA and its on-site
   reconnaissance, the DTSC concluded that no additional regulatory action would be necessary with
   respect to investigation and remediation of the property (i.e., implementation of Phase II and Phase
   III of the hazardous materials/waste program). (Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study, Hillsdale
   High School New Student Services Building and Modernization, April 2003).

For construction activities during the currently proposed project, any hazardous materials/wastes would
be managed, handled, disposed of, and transported in accordance with local, state, and federal
requirements. Upon the opening of the new facilities, their operation would result in an incremental
increase in the use of cleaning agents, solvents, paints and other hazardous materials/wastes that are
routinely used for maintenance and repairs. Since District staff would be aware of the safe use and
disposal of these chemicals and existing District management programs for their handling and use would
be applied, no significant impact is expected from the routine use and disposal of these materials.

h) Hazard resulting from reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving release of
   hazardous materials into the environment?

Less Than Significant Impact. The project would not create a significant hazard to the public or the
environment. During construction, materials such as gasoline and diesel fuels would be routinely
managed to avoid spills. Subsequent operation of the facilities would not result in substantial release of
hazardous materials/wastes into the environment. Only a small amount of such substances would be
used for routine maintenance and repairs consistent with existing District management programs for the
safe handling and application of hazardous materials/wastes. See item VI. a, above.

c) Emit or handle hazardous/acutely hazardous materials emissions, materials, substances or waste
   within one-quarter mile of existing or proposed school?

Less Than Significant Impact. For operation of the new facilities, hazardous materials or substances
would only be used for routine repair and maintenance activities. Such use would pose a less than
significant impact associated with emissions or handling. The school is surrounded by residential lands.
See the responses to items VII.a and b, above.

d) Located on a site included on list of hazardous materials sites or create public/environmental
   hazard?

Less Than Significant Impact. The proposed project would be implemented at an existing high school.
The property is not listed as a hazardous materials site. See the responses to items VII.a and b, above.

 However, based upon the 2001 ESA, the Hillsdale High School site did appear on the HAZNET
database for the generation of asbestos-containing waste that was disposed at a landfill. In addition, the
database includes information about the disposal of various chemical wastes associated with the
school's science and art departments. The proposed project would not have any effects associated with
this database information.

e) Located within an airport use plan or within two miles ofpublic airport?

No Impact. The proposed site is not located within an adopted airport use plan nor is it within two miles
of a public airport. The nearest public airports, San Francisco International Airport and the San Carlos
Airport (County of San Mateo), are each well over two miles away from the high school.

f)    Located within vicinity of a private airstrip?

No Impact. The proposed site is not located in the vicinity of any known private airstrips.

g) Impair or inteifere with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan?

No Impact. The project would not substantially affect coordination with emergency response or
emergency evacuation plans for the area. The City of San Mateo works with the County of San Mateo
and the Governor's Office of Emergency Services to coordinate emergency response in their
jurisdiction. Specific emergency measures already in-place at the high school would be applicable.

h) Expose people or structures to significant risk of wildland fires?

No Impact. The proposed project would not expose people or structures to significant risk of wildland
fires. It is surrounded by existing urban uses including residences and roadways. In addition, the City
of San Mateo Fire Station 23 is located about 1.2 miles and about five minutes response time from the
high school.

IX.     HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements?
b) substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with groundwater recharge such
   that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level?
c) substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration
   of the course of a stream or river, in a manner which would result in substantial erosion or siltation
   on- or off-site?
d) substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including the alteration of a
   stream or river, or substantially increase the rate or amount of surface runoff in a manner which
   would result in flooding on- or off-site?

 e) create or contribute runoff water which would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater
    drainage systems or provide substantial additional sources ofpolluted runojj?
f) otherwise substantially degrade water quality?
g) place housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a federal Flood Hazard Boundary
     or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard delineation map?
 h) place within alOO-year flood hazard area structures which would impede or redirect flood flows?
 i) expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including
    flooding as a result ofthe failure of a levee or dam?
j) inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow?

a) Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements?

Less Than Significant Impact. No water quality standards or waste discharge requirements would be
violated by the development of the new facilities. The District would obtain a construction activity
stormwater permit as required by the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The permit would address
possible contaminants (e.g., sediments) in site runoff from grading and foundation work that could
affect water quality during construction. With implementation of control measures such as BMPs as
part of the mandatory Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program, no water quality standards would be
significantly affected.

The operation of the new facilities would result in a similar quantity and likely improved quality of
runoff from impermeable surfaces as the currently existing conditions. To address water quantity and
quality during operation of the new facilities, the District would implement relevant C.3 measures
established by the R WQCB and the associated Municipal Regional Permit (e.g., prevention of net
increase to off-site stormwater discharge between pre- and post-development; treatment of stormwater
runoff; biofiltration sod and use of native "no-mow" sod) that have been incorporated into the proposed
project. Tree removal would be minimized to the extent practicable and those specimens to be removed
would be replaced.

b) Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere with groundwater recharge?

Less Than Significant Impact. Development of the project would not significantly deplete any sources
of groundwater or interfere with its discharge. The new facilities would be built within an existing
school site of about 35.4 acres that is already partially overcovered with impermeable surfaces along
with permeable areas that include the athletic fields, lawn area, and landscaping. The current
impervious area of the project site comprises about 1.63 acres while there are 1.87 acres of pervious
surface. Post-development would result in a minor change of approximately 1.90 acres of impervious
and 1.61 acres of pervious surface, a net impervious increase of about 0.27 acre. According to both
current and previous groundwater exploration of the upper slopes of the school site, groundwater
appears to be approximately 15 feet or more beneath the surface and probably fluctuates with seasonal
changes, geologic conditions and rainfall variations (Cleary Consultants, Inc. Geotechnical
Investigation - Two-story Classroom Building- Hillsdale High School - San Mateo, California, March
2014 and Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study, New Student Services Building and Modernization,
April2003).

In accordance with the City of San Mateo's Permit with the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality
Control Board National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit (Municipal Regional
Permit), C.3 measures for Best Management Practices stormwater management would be implemented
to emulate existing drainage characteristics during operation of the new facilities. Site runoff would be
collected, treated and detained on-site through the use of design, source control, and treatment measures
including flow-through planters, tree well filters, and natural self-treating turf and landscaping areas.
The runoff would be managed similar to the existing conditions The rate of off-site stormwater
discharge would be regulated so that the school peak runoff quantity would not exceed pre-project
levels. Very minimal change would occur to the quantity of any existing runoff and the potential effects
upon groundwater recharge and percolation would not be significant.

c) Substantially alter existing drainage patterns leading to substantial erosion or sedimentation?

No Impact. Construction activities and operation of the proposed facilities are not expected to result in
substantial erosion or sedimentation. As discussed previously (see the responses to items VIII.a and b,
above), drainage patterns would not be altered by construction ofthe project and much ofthe runoff
would continue to percolate to the groundwater or would be subsequently recharged. The District
would obtain and comply with the construction activity stormwater permit consistent with Regional
Water Quality Control Board requirements during construction. Conformance with these requirements,
including the implementation of BMPs and other measures to retain runoff on-site and reduction of
sediments, would effectively control potential erosion or sedimentation. Implementation of applicable
C.3 measures would emulate current runoff conditions. There are no streams or rivers in near or
immediate proximity to the proposed project site.

d) Substantially alter existing drainage patterns leading to substantial increase in rate/amount of
   sutface runoff that would cause on-site or off-site flooding?

No Impact. The implementation of the proposed project would not substantially alter existing drainage
patterns that would cause on-site or off-site flooding (see response to items VIII.a, band c, above).
Surface runoff from the school site would continue to percolate to the groundwater or would be
collected by proposed stormwater drainage facilities for subsequent discharge.

e) Create or contribute runoff that would exceed capacity of existing drainage systems or provide
   substantial additional sources ofpolluted runoff?

Less Than Significant Impact. The development of the proposed project would not create or contribute
runoff that would significantly exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage systems
or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff. As discussed in items VIII.a, b and c,
above, drainage from the site would not substantially change from existing conditions with the
development of required new facilities for stormwater collection, treatment, and retention that have been
incorporated into the proposed project. While urban contaminants from development of more parking
within the campus could add to the existing on-site pollutants, the total amount of contaminants would
not significantly increase. Part of the increased number of student coming to the high school would
walk or bicycle and others would be drop-off/pick-up from auto trips that would not enter the campus.

 A small amount of additional fertilizers and other chemicals, could result from maintenance of the
larger field. However, the quantity would be relatively small and would continue to manage and apply
such materials in accordance with manufacturers' guidelines to minimize impacts to the extent
practicable.

f)   Otherwise substantially degrade water quality?

Less Than Significant Impact. See the responses to items VIlLa, b and e, above.

g) Place housing within 100-year flood hazard area (as mapped on federal Flood Hazard Boundary,
   Flood Insurance Rate Map, or other delineated map)?

No Impact. The development of the proposed project would not involve housing.

h) Place structures within 100-year flood hazard area that would impede or redirect flood flows?

No Impact. The proposed project site is not located within a 100-year flood hazard area. The high
school and most of the adjacent vicinity is in Zone Z, an area of minimal flood hazard (FEMA Flood
Zone Map, City ofSan Mateo, effective October 16, 2012).

i)   Expose people or structures to significant risks from flooding as a result of levee or dam
     failure?

No Impact. There are no major dams or large bodies of water located upstream of the project site that
would pose a significant risk from flooding as a result of failure. The nearest dammed body of water is
San Mateo Creek which flows from Crystal Springs Reservoir to San Francisco Bay. Because the creek
is relatively small, about two miles away and the high school is located on a hilly site, there would be no
impact to the proposed project caused by a levee or dam failure. Another stream, Laurel Creek, is
situated just south of the high school on the other side of West Hillsdale Boulevard. The creek collects
a small amount of local drainage and flows from Laurel wood Park. It does not pose a significant risk
from flooding that would result from a levee or dam failure.

j)   Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow?

No Impact. The proposed project site would not be impacted by a seiche, tsunami, or mudflow. The
school is approximately two and one-half miles from Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir and Upper
Crystal Springs Reservoir. In the event of a major seismic event, there is a possibility that a seiche
(oscillations caused by seismic shaking of an enclosed body of water) could occur. However, because
of the hills surrounding much of the reservoirs, the possibility that the project site would be affected
would be remote. Water from the lake would likely move toward low-lying areas, including San Mateo
Creek that is well-away from the high school.

Adverse effects from a mudflow would not occur. The site is largely overcovered with structures,
paving and landscaping. Measures to stabilize and bolster the small slope area within the area in the
south-southwest portion of the project site would preclude any possibility of a mudflow. Consistent

with RWQCB requirements, site preparation during construction would be scheduled for the dry period
ofthe year (April to part of October).

A tsunami (a large sea wave) caused by undersea earth movements (e.g., seismic activity, rockslides,
volcanos) would not affect the proposed project location. The elevation of the high school, well above
sea level and two miles from the nearest part of the San Francisco Bay shoreline would preclude any
effects of a possible tsunami (Benson Lee, Consulting, Initial Study, New Student Services Building and
Modernization, Apri12003).

V.   LAND USE AND PLANNING

Significance Criteria

Would the project:

a) physically divide an established community?
b) conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over
   the project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, local coastal program, or
  zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect?
c) conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan?

a) Physically divide an established community?

No Impact. The project would not physically divide an established community. The proposed project
would be located within an existing high school.

b) Conflict with land use plan, policy or regulation ofjurisdictional agency?

No Impact. The project site is consistent with the City's land use designation and zoning classification.
The site is owned by the District, which is responsible for provision of adequate public school facilities.

c) Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan?

No Impact. The project site would be located within an existing school site. There are no habitat
conservation or natural community conservation plans that are applicable to the property.

XL MINERAL RESOURCES

Would the project:

a) result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would be of value to the region and
  the residents of the state?
b) result in the loss of availability of a locally important mineral resource recovery site delineated on a

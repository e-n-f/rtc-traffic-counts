Traffic Impact Technical Report
1.      Introduction
This traffic analysis was conducted to review the impacts of one additional train using three
existing and one proposed at-grade crossings within Hoquiam, Washington as a result of a
proposed operational change for this railroad facility. Traffic impacts at adjacent intersections,
as well as crossing locations, were analyzed for potential impacts during the opening year,
2014, and the design year of 2034 for the project.


2.      Project Description
Grays Harbor Rail Terminal LLC (GHRT) is proposing a bulk liquids rail logistics facility at the
Port of Grays Harbor Terminal 3 (T3) property. The facility will accommodate the receipt for
export of not more than 45,000 barrels per day on average of various liquid bulk materials,
specifically, various types of crude oil and condensates.


T3 is a 150 acre industrial site and includes an existing 600-foot- long concrete shipping
terminal. The Port of Grays Harbor currently leases approximately 25 acres of the T3 site to a
private tenant (Willis Enterprises), which utilizes the property for storing and sorting logs, and
operating a wood chipping and processing facility. The tenant utilizes the existing wharf for
product loading on to barges for export. The remaining area of the property (a former mill site)
is occupied by 4 metal buildings and a rail spur line but is otherwise currently vacant.


The liquid bulk materials would be delivered to the proposed facility via unit trains in fully
contained liquid bulk rail cars, unloaded into on-site storage tanks, and then loaded onto barges
or other marine vessels for delivery to refineries.


The general layout of the proposed rail and off-loading facilities includes four 20-car yard tracks
and two 20-car off-loading tracks (120 rail cars total). In addition, a "run-around" track would be
used to reposition the locomotive engines and could also be used to hold cars awaiting
maintenance. The off-loading spots would be equipped with permanent rack access structures
where each rack structure would support connections for a maximum of 40 rail cars (20 spots
on each side of a rack). The off-loading spots and central header would be located within
secondary containment. The rack structures consist of elevated steel walkways with extendable
access platforms used to access the tops of the rail cars. Off-loading would occur via 4-inch dry
break connections, hoses, valves, and risers connecting the bottom rail car couplers to a central
piping header. The rail cars would be off-loaded by gravity feed into the central header.


The liquid bulk materials would be stored in approximately six to eight above-ground storage
tanks with secondary containment and internal floating roofs until a marine vessel (ship or
barge) arrives. All tanks will be located outside the Shoreline District. The total combined tank
storage would be approximately 800,000 ­ 1,000,000 barrels. Construction of multiple storage

tanks would allow the facility to accommodate interruptions in vessel schedules as well as
changes in delivery volumes, and would allow the facility to maintain consistent operations.
Vessel calls are anticipated by barge and Panamax vessels occurring approximately 3-4 times
per month.


As noted above, T3 includes an existing 600-foot-long concrete shipping terminal. There are
currently four mooring dolphins (three downstream/one upstream) off the existing concrete
wharf. Up to four additional mooring dolphins (two downstream and two upstream) would be
constructed to minimize vessel movements during liquid bulk materials transfer. No additional
overwater expansion of the wharf is proposed. The existing trestle (supporting the Willis
conveyor) and the wharf can accommodate the liquid bulk materials pipe rack needed to
transfer the materials from the tanks to the vessels. Stormwater collection, drainage
improvements, and spill containment measures would be added to the existing wharf but no
structural modifications are necessary.


To facilitate operations at the Grays Harbor Rail Terminal, the Puget Sound and Pacific Railroad
would be permitting and supervising construction of an industrial lead track extension of their
main line railroad system. This industrial lead track would extend from the current main line rail
terminus, just east of Paulson Road, for approximately 1,300 lineal feet to the west. The
industrial lead track would allow for the backing of rail cars strings into the project site and
provide additional rail car storage for other Port tenants. The identification of the industrial lead
track is to account for potential indirect or cumulative environmental impacts for the purposes of
the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) only and is not a project component of the Grays
Harbor Rail Terminal site development permitting.


3.      Study Area
The study area is shown in Figure 1. The intersections and crossing locations analyzed within
the study area are all within the city of Hoquiam, Washington. State Route (SR) 109 is the main
arterial within Hoquiam, running east-west through the study area. The rest of the roadway
network within the study area serves as access into residential, commercial, and industrial land
uses. The project rail line runs generally east-west to the south of SR 109, but as it moves east
through the study area, the route bears farther to the south of SR 109. There are currently three
at-grade crossings, all of which are on local streets: S. Adams Street, 5th Street, and 8th Street.
Only one of the at-grade crossings has crossing gates, the 8th Street crossing. The proposed
project will create a fourth at-grade crossing at Paulson Road, just south of SR 109, by
extending the existing rail line to the west of Paulson Road. All study area intersections are stop
controlled except for the intersection of S. Adams Street with SR 109, which is signalized. In
total, 13 area intersections are included in the analysis, as well as the three existing and one
proposed at-grade rail crossing.

4.      Methodology
The operational conditions within the study area were evaluated by using a level of
service (LOS) analysis based on the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology.
LOS refers to the degree of congestion on a roadway or at an intersection, measured in
average delay, based on the methodologies provided in the 2010 HCM. LOS A
represents free-flow conditions (motorists experience little or no delay, and traffic levels
are well below roadway capacity), LOS F represents forced-flow conditions (motorists
experience very long delays, and traffic volumes exceed roadway capacity). LOS B to E
represent decreasing operational conditions. For the intersections within the study area,
a traffic analysis program, known as Synchro (Version 8.0), was used to determine
intersection delay, queue lengths, and LOS for the peak A.M. and peak P.M. hourly
volumes.


The minimum acceptable LOS was determined to be LOS C based on the WSDOT
Design Manual (2013) guidelines for this type of facility.


Queuing information from the Synchro analysis was used to determine potential issues
at railroad crossing locations within the study area.


5.      Proposed Roadway Network
The proposed new crossing at Paulson Road will require additional safety features such
as crossing gates; however, there will not be any geometric changes to the roadway
network as a result of the project. No geometric or operational changes from the existing
conditions were included in the year of opening or design year operational analyses.


6.      Intersection Traffic Operations
Existing traffic volumes were collected for the A.M. and P.M. peak periods at all study
area intersections. The existing traffic volumes are shown in Appendix A and represent
2013 conditions. Year of opening (2014) and design year (2034) traffic volumes were
developed by applying a 0.5-percent annual growth rate to existing traffic volumes. This
growth percentage was applied after reviewing historical count information provided in
the City of Hoquiam Comprehensive Land Use Plan (2009), which showed no traffic
growth year over year prior to the reports publishing. The project team used 0.5 percent
growth to show a worst case scenario, even though traffic volume may grow at a lower
rate. No additional roadway traffic is anticipated as a result of the project.


Intersection operation analyses were performed under existing, year of opening, and
design year conditions. Intersection delay and level of service summary information is

shown in Table 1. For unsignalized intersections, the worst approach delay is shown in
the table. Under the opening year and design year conditions, traffic operations will
degrade from their current level; however, no study area intersection will operate below
the WSDOT minimum operation standard LOS C. The full traffic analysis results are
shown in Appendix B.

7.      At-Grade Railroad Crossing Operations
The project proposes adding one train per day through the study area. Regardless of
traffic volume, one additional train crossing per day will create delay that is not present
under existing conditions. The extent of the impact depends on the time of day the
additional crossing occurs. For the traffic analysis, a worse-case assumption that the
additional train would block crossings through the study area during the P.M. peak hour
was used. Queuing and delay from the Synchro analysis at nearby intersections was
analyzed to determine impacts that train crossings may have at the four study area
crossings.


The three crossings at S Adams Street, 5th Street, and 8th Street will experience more
delay to through traffic but should not have queuing issues impacting the roadway
network due to the low volume at these crossings at year of opening and in the design
year, as well as the geometric design of the surrounding roadway network.


Although the traffic volume on Paulson Road is expected to be low in the year of
opening and design year, the proximity of this crossing to the intersection with SR 109
will create a safety issue during a crossing event. Guidance from the Railroad-Highway
Grade Crossing Handbook (2007) recommends the use of railroad pre-signals in
addition to crossing gates in cases where crossings are within 75 feet of an intersection.
The pre-signal would be interconnected with the rail system to stop vehicles south of the
crossing to avoid potential queues backing onto the tracks from the intersection with SR
109.


8.      Safety Impacts
Increased train traffic and vehicular traffic, combined with a new at-grade crossing, could
increase vehicle/train exposure. Therefore, the proposed project will include crossing
gates at the Paulson Road crossing to improve safety between trains and motor
vehicles, especially in light of the proximity of this crossing to the intersection with SR
109. Actions would be taken to ensure that rail services provide enough advanced
warning to the Paulson Road crossing pre-signal to clear queued vehicles on Paulson
Road or ensure that northbound roadway traffic is stopped prior to the crossing.


9.      Conclusion
The proposed project would not have foreseeable operational impacts on roadway traffic
and, therefore, would not require mitigation. The addition of advance warning crossing
gates and a pre-signal at the new crossing with Paulson Road should be designed to
ensure enough time to clear vehicles at the intersection of Paulson Road with SR 109.

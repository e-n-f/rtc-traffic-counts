The memorandum presents the results of an updated existing and future conditions analysis for
the Sherwood Adams Avenue North Improvements Project. It includes documentation of
existing facilities, documentation of applicable agency transportation standards, existing
operations analysis, future no-build operations analysis, and future operations analysis with the
Adams Avenue North extension.
This project consists of the extension of Adams Avenue from Tualatin-Sherwood Boulevard to
the Home Depot access along Highway 99W. The initial project study area is shown in Figure 1.

Existing Facilities
The following sections discuss the existing transportation facilities in the project area, including
a review of existing pedestrian, bicycle, and motor vehicle facilities.

Pedestrian Facilities
An inventory of sidewalks along key roadways within the study area was conducted. Currently,
Tualatin-Sherwood Road has sidewalks on both sides through the study area. Highway 99W has
sidewalks on both sides until just north of the Home Depot store, where the sidewalks terminate
with the beginning of the rural highway section. Edy Road and Sherwood Boulevard also have
sidewalks near the intersection with Highway 99W in the study area.

Bicycle Facilities
To assess the adequacy of bicycle facilities within the study area, a brief field inventory of
designated bike lanes and shoulder bikeways along key roadways was conducted. There are bike
lanes in both directions along Highway 99W, Tualatin-Sherwood Road, Edy Road, and
Sherwood Boulevard through the study area. No other key study area roads have bike lanes.

Motor Vehicle Facilities
Field inventories were conducted to determine characteristics of roadways within the study area.
Data collected included posted speed limits, roadway lanes, lane configurations, and intersection
controls. These characteristics define corridor capacity and operating speeds through the street
system, which affect travel path choices for drivers in the study area. The results are listed in
Table 1.

Agency Transportation Standards
Two key agency transportation standards that are required to be addressed for this project include
intersection operations/mobility standards and access management standards. An explanation of
each is given in the following sections, along with the applicable standards.

Intersection Operations and Mobility Standards
Level of service (LOS) and volume to capacity (v/c) ratios as defined in the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual1 (HCM) are two measures of effectiveness (MOEs) that are used as the basis
for intersection operations and mobility standards. Explanations of each are given below.
LOS is similar to a "report card" rating based upon average vehicle delay. Level of Service A, B,
and C indicate conditions where traffic moves without significant delays over periods of peak
hour travel demand. Level of Service D and E are progressively worse peak hour operating
conditions. Level of Service F represents conditions where average vehicle delay exceeds 80
seconds per vehicle entering a signalized intersection and demand has exceeded capacity. This
condition is typically evident in long queues and delays. Unsignalized intersections provide
levels of service for major and minor street turning movements. For this reason, LOS E and even
LOS F can occur for a specific turning movement; however, the majority of traffic may not be
delayed (in cases where major street traffic is not required to stop). LOS E or F conditions at
unsignalized intersections generally provide a basis to study intersections further to determine
availability of acceptable gaps, safety and traffic signal warrants.
Volume to capacity (v/c) ratio is the peak hour traffic volume at an intersection divided by the
maximum volume that intersection can handle. For example, when a v/c is 0.80, peak hour traffic
is using 80 percent of the intersection capacity. If traffic volumes exceed capacity, excessive
queues will form and will lengthen until demand subsides below the available capacity (e.g.
vehicles waiting to travel through a signalized intersection may have to wait for multiple signal
cycles). When the v/c approaches 1.0, intersection operation becomes unstable and small
disruptions can cause traffic flow to break down.
The minimum operational standard specified in the City of Sherwood Transportation System
Plan is LOS D2. The maximum v/c ratio specified by Washington County is 0.99 for signalized
intersections.3 The minimum operational standard for unsignalized intersections specified by
Washington County is LOS E. In the case of Highway 99W, ODOT operating performance
standards for the study area utilize a v/c ratio of 0.99 for intersections not in a town center and
1.1 for those that are.4 The intersections of Highway 99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road and
Highway 99W/Edy Road-Sherwood Boulevard are within the Town Center limits.5 Based on
recent conversations and meetings, ODOT has decided to not acknowledge the Town Center
limits without the City completing a Town Center Plan. Therefore, ODOT intends to use a
maximum v/c ratio of 0.99 for all of Highway 99W through Sherwood.

Access Management Standards
Proper roadway access spacing is important to maintain operating characteristics and safety.
While all parcels are allowed access, it is desired that access to parcels along major roadways be
limited to side streets or consolidated. When roadway access points are located too frequently
along a roadway, safety and roadway capacity are diminished. Access management practices can
help roadways operate more efficiently and include closure, consolidation, or relocation of
accesses. It is best to incorporate appropriate access spacing practices upon initial development
or redevelopment to limit the amount of management required in the future.
The ODOT access management standards, as defined in OAR 734-051, call for minimum
distances between access points on the same side of statewide highways. The standards vary
depending on posted speed on the roadway. Highway 99W is a 45 mph statewide highway that
meets ODOT access spacing standards for all roadway intersections and driveways located along
the highway within the study area. Additional access spacing standards for study area roadways
are identified in the Sherwood TSP and are included in Table 2.

HCM Delay vs. Micro-Simulation Delay
Agency delay standards are based on the results of a HCM analysis. However, the HCM
methodology treats intersections as isolated nodes that are not impacted by operations at other
nearby intersections. The project study area includes seven intersections along Tualatin-
Sherwood Road that, under peak hour traffic conditions, experience excessive vehicle queuing
impacts that significantly increase driver delay. Therefore, the HCM delay is not an accurate
measure of the true intersection delay. While agencies do not have adopted standards for micro-
simulation delay, the micro-simulation delay can give a more accurate picture of congestion.
Therefore, the intersection operations analysis for this study reports both HCM and micro-
simulation delay.

Existing Intersection Operations
The existing intersection operations analysis includes a summary of the existing study
intersection volumes and an analysis of the existing intersection operations.

Existing Volumes
An inventory of peak hour traffic conditions was performed in the fall of 2008. Eleven study
intersections within the study area were selected for focused analysis in order to address areas of
concern along major roadways and to monitor impacts of potential built-out within the Concept
Plan area. During the AM peak hour (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) and the PM peak hour (4:00 to 6:00
p.m.), turn movement counts were conducted at the study intersections. The count data was then
used as a basis for evaluating traffic performance at the study intersections for existing PM peak
hour conditions. The existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at study intersections are
shown in Figure 2.
The traffic volumes were compared to year 2006 historic data in the study area documented in
the I-5 to 99W Connector Project6. Current traffic volumes were found to have decreased
significantly during the PM peak hour on Tualatin-Sherwood Road in the westbound direction,
with reductions up to 300 vehicles per hour. While these reductions in traffic volume could be a
result of day-to-day or seasonal fluctuation, they could also be the result of decreased traffic
volumes in the area due to current economic conditions or they could reflect driver route changes
to other less congested corridors.

Existing Operations
The 30th highest hour intersection volumes7 were used to determine the existing study
intersection operating conditions based on the HCM methodology for signalized and
unsignalized intersections. The results of this analysis are listed in Table 3 for the AM peak hour
and Table 4 for the PM peak hour. As listed, each of the signalized study intersections meets
mobility standards during both the AM and PM peak hour, with the exception of Highway
99W/Tualatin Sherwood Road. If ODOT applies a standard v/c ratio of 0.99, the intersection of
Highway 99W/Tualatin Sherwood Road fails under existing conditions. The unsignalized
intersections of Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Gerda Lane and Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Adams
Avenue fail to meet LOS standards due to the side-street movements.
The micro-simulation results for the study intersections indicate a few locations where particular
traffic movements are over capacity, which cause significant increased to driver delay. During
the AM peak hour, the eastbound approach of Tualatin-Sherwood Road (Roy Rogers Road) at
Highway 99W experiences traffic signal cycles that fail to clear all of the queued vehicles.
During the PM peak hour, westbound traffic volumes on Tualatin-Sherwood Road approaching
Highway 99W queue back through the Shopping Center signal and significantly increases driver
delay.

  30th Highest Hour Volumes (30th HHVs) are used to account for seasonal trends in traffic patterns. . A seasonal
adjustment factor of 1.09 was applied to Highway 99W through volumes based on local traffic trends and ODOT
procedures for calculating a seasonal adjustment factor.

Future No-Build Operations
Future operations analysis was performed for the study intersections under the no-build scenario,
which assumes the completion of financially constrained roadway improvements but does not
include the extension of Adams Avenue to the north. In addition, the lands with the Concept Plan
area for the project were assumed to develop under existing zoning. The planned roadway
improvements include:
      Signalization of Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Adams Avenue
      Conversion of Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Baler Way to right-in/right-out and signal
       removal
      Widening of Tualatin-Sherwood Road and Roy Rogers Road to 5-lanes from Teton
       Avenue to west of Highway 99W (tapers to three lanes east of Borchers Drive)
      Completion of the Adams Avenue South Extension from Oregon Street to Century Drive
      Intersection geometric, turn lane, and signal phasing improvements at Highway
       99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road
      Completion of the 124th Avenue extension from Tualatin-Sherwood Road to Tonquin
       Road
      Widening of Tonquin Road to 3-lanes
      Signalization of Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Gerda Lane
The existing zoning of the lands within the City of Sherwood in the Concept Plan area is light
industrial. The Concept Plan area outside of the City limit is zoned for rural density (e.g., one
home per 20 acres). The Metro 2030 travel demand model includes approximately 150 non-
retail employees in the Concept Plan area, which is equivalent to a floor-area-ratio (FAR) of 0.30
for the lands not restricted by the BPA easements. Therefore, the base Metro forecast for the
area represents a reasonable build-out of existing zoning.
The following sections include a summary of the future intersection volume forecasting and the
resulting intersection operations.

Future Volumes
Future year 2030 turning movement volumes were estimated for the study intersections using the
travel demand model developed by Metro, Washington County, and the I-5 to 99W Connector
Project team. To further refine the forecasts, a sub-area model was developed for the study area
that includes all public streets and utilizes HCM node delays for trip assignment in order to
evaluate changes in circulation and traffic control. The boundaries for the sub-area model include
Highway 99W to the northeast, Roy Rogers Road to the northwest, Oregon Street to the
southeast, Sherwood Boulevard/Edy Road to the southwest, and Cipole Road to the east.
Calibration was performed on the enhanced 2005 base year model using the existing 30th highest
hourly volumes (30th HV) at the study intersections. A future year 2030 sub-area model was then
developed by coding the planned improvements into the model network re-assigning the 2030
Metro model trip tables. The 2030 future year volumes were then estimated by a post-processing
methodology that includes adding the growth increment between the 2005 base year and 2030
future year models for each turn movement to the 2008 existing year 30th HV. The future
volumes under the future no-build scenario are shown in Figure 3.

                                                                                      May 8, 2009

Future Operations
The traffic volumes forecasted for the 2030 No-Build Scenario were used to analyze operating
conditions at the study intersections. The results of this analysis are listed in Table 5 for the AM
peak hour and Table 6 for the PM peak hour. As shown in the tables, operating standards are
exceeded at Highway 99W/Cipole Road and Highway 99W/Edy Road/ Sherwood Blvd during
the AM and PM peak hours.
There are three main differences between the future and existing operations. First, the Highway
99W/Cipole Road and Highway 99W/Edy Road/ Sherwood Blvd intersections were not failing
under existing operations but are expected to fail in the future. Second, the intersections of
Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Adams Avenue and Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Gerda Lane were failing
under the existing conditions, and no longer fail in the 2030 No-Build scenario; this is because
the intersections will be signalized and also because of the Tualatin-Sherwood Road widening.
Third, the intersection of Highway 99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road was failing under existing PM
peak conditions but would no longer fail in the future due to roadway widening, additional turn
lanes, and in improved signal phasing. Significant increases in vehicle delay and v/c ratios were
found at the majority of study intersections due to future growth.
The simulation delay attained from micro-simulation runs holds distinctly different results due to
corridor congestion. Both Highway 99W through the study area and Tualatin-Sherwood Road
from Highway 99W through Adams Avenue would experience substantial congestion with
average vehicle delays well above acceptable levels.

Future Operations with Adams Avenue North Extension
Future 2030 forecasting and operations analysis was performed for a scenario that includes the
Adams Avenue North extension between the Tualatin-Sherwood Road/Adams Avenue
intersection and the Home Depot access to Highway 99W. The financially constrained roadway
improvements that were included in the future no-build scenario and the base land use for the
Concept Plan area were maintained for this scenario.

Future Volumes with Adams Avenue North Extension
The forecasted traffic volumes that were estimated are shown in Figure 4. With the addition of
the Adams Avenue North Extension, a portion of traffic moves between Tualatin-Sherwood
Road and Highway 99W to utilize Adams Avenue and avoid the congested intersection of
Highway 99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road. During the AM Peak hour, approximately 500 vehicles
would use Adams Avenue North. During the PM peak hour, approximately 700 vehicles use
Adams Avenue North.

Future Operations with Adams Avenue North Extension
In addition to the volume analysis, study intersection operations were analyzed and are
summarized in Table 7 for the AM peak hour and Table 8 for the PM peak hour. As shown in the
tables, operating standards are exceeded at Highway 99W/Cipole Road in AM and PM peak
hours.
The future operations are consistent with the no-build scenario, with Highway 99W/Cipole Road
and Highway 99W/Edy Road/ Sherwood Blvd failing to meet operating standards with and
without the Adams Avenue north extension. Traffic operations at Highway 99W/Cipole Road
did slightly improve with the Adams Avenue North Extension.
The micro-simulation delay is fairly consistent with the no-build scenario, as study intersections
do not show major differences in average vehicle delay. As with the no-build scenario, the
Highway 99W and Tualatin-Sherwood Road corridors continue to be over-capacity with
excessive queues creating additional vehicle delays at upstream intersections.

Progression Analysis
In addition to the intersection operations analysis presented in the previous sections, ODOT also
requires a corridor progression analysis to assure travel times and corridor through capacity will
be maintained. To establish a baseline for the alternatives analysis, a traffic signal progression
analysis was conducted for the Highway 99W corridor section that includes the following
signalized and coordinated intersections:
          Highway 99W/Home Depot
          Highway 99W/Tualatin-Sherwood Road
          Highway 99W/Sherwood Boulevard-Edy Road
The signal analysis progression analysis is based on the 2008 existing and 2030 future no-build
traffic signal system operations during both the AM peak hour and the PM peak hour. The
through traffic bandwidths (i.e., the window of time where a platoon of vehicles can travel
through all three signals without stopping) along Highway 99W in the study corridor for the
2008 Existing and 2030 future no-build conditions are shown in Table 9.
The through traffic bandwidths shown in Table 9 were used to determine the study area corridor
progression volume to capacity (V/C) ratios8. These maximum bandwidths assume that each
signal reaches its maximum initial phase time, which is the worst case scenario.

BW = Traffic bandwidth
V/C = Corridor progression volume to capacity ratio

As shown in Table 9, the corridor progression volume to capacity ratio is above 1.00 for many of
the existing and future time periods, indicating that there is not enough bandwidth to efficiently
serve existing and projected traffic volumes in the coordinated system.
The critical intersection in the study corridor (the intersection carrying the highest through
volume per lane) is the Highway 99W/Home Depot intersection. The intersections in the study
corridor had a common cycle length of 120 seconds. Adequate pedestrian timing was provided at
the intersections where appropriate.

1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1.     Purpose of Report
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
Courtyards on Nantz Development that is proposed along the north side of Nantz Road, west of
Catawba Avenue in Cornelius, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is to determine the
potential impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic generated by the
proposed development.


1.2.     Study Objectives
The Courtyards on Nantz Development is proposed to consist of 63 single-family detached homes
for senior adults and 8,000 square feet of medical-dental office space. Two site driveways would
be located on Nantz Road. Each driveway would form an unsignalized three-leg intersection. The
western driveway would provide access to the residential portion of the development. The eastern
driveway would provide access to the office building. For purposes of this study, it is assumed that
the development will be fully built out by 2015.


Refer to Figure 1 in Appendix A for an illustration of the site location. Refer to Figure 2 for the
preliminary site plan. The objective of this report is to determine what geometric improvements
are necessary to mitigate traffic conditions on the transportation network surrounding the site with
the proposed development fully built out.

2.       AREA CONDITIONS
2.1.     Transportation Network Study Area
2.1.1.   Area Roadway System
The project study area for this TIS was determined through coordination with the Town of
Cornelius and NCDOT. The study area consists of one intersection; Catawba Avenue at Nantz
Road.
                                           Courtyards On Nantz Development –Traffic Impact Study

Catawba Avenue is a two-lane principal arterial with a speed limit of 35 miles per hour (mph). The
road carries approximately 21,000 vehicles per day (vehicles per day) within the vicinity of the site
according to NCDOT 2012 Average Daily Traffic (ADT) data, which is the most recent available.


Nantz Road is a two-lane local facility. The speed limit is 35 mph. The road carries approximately
1,400 vpd within the vicinity of the site according to NCDOT 2012 volumes.


2.1.1.1. Existing
Existing lane configurations (number of traffic lanes on the intersection approach), storage
capacities, and other intersection and roadway information within the study area was collected
through field reconnaissance by Ramey Kemp and Associates, Inc. (RKA). Refer to Figure 3 for
the existing lane configurations and traffic control at study intersections.


2.1.1.2. Future
At this time, it is our understanding that no roadway projects have been identified within the
vicinity of the site.


2.1.2.   Existing Traffic Volumes and Conditions
Existing peak hour traffic volumes were obtained from a traffic count performed at the intersection
of Catawba Avenue and Nantz Road. A 12-hour count was conducted between 7:00 AM and 7:00
PM. A copy of the traffic count data can be found in Appendix B of this report. Refer to Figure 4
for an illustration of the existing (2013) peak hour traffic volumes.


2.2.     Study Area – Adjacent Land Use
2.2.1.   Existing Land Uses
The existing site is residential and partially undeveloped. The surrounding land uses primarily
consist of residential and commercial.

2.2.2.   Anticipated or Approved Adjacent Developments
No future adjacent developments were identified within the vicinity of the site.

3.       PROJECTED TRAFFIC
3.1.     Site Traffic
In order to determine the future traffic conditions after the development is completed, an estimate
of traffic projected to travel to/from the proposed development is required.

3.1.1.   Trip Generation
The average weekday daily as well as AM and PM peak hour site trips for this study were
calculated based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition. At build-out, the site is expected to consist of 63 single-family detached homes for senior
adults and 8,000 square feet of medical-dental office space. Table 1 presents a summary of the trip
generation calculations for the proposed development.

3.1.2.   Trip Distribution and Assignment
For this study, the trip distribution percentages were developed based on existing traffic patterns,
location of population centers, and engineering judgment. The proposed site includes two
driveways. The western driveway would provide access to the residential portion of the
development. The eastern driveway would provide access to the office building. It was assumed
that all trips generated by the residential land use would enter and exit the site using the western
driveway. Similarly, all trips generated by the office land use would enter and exit the site using
the eastern driveway. Refer to Figures 5 and 6 for an illustration of the primary site distribution
percentages and assignments.

3.2.     Future Traffic
3.2.1.   No-Build Condition
Projected 2015 traffic volumes were developed by applying a compounded annual growth rate of
3% to existing traffic volumes and are shown in Figure 7. These projected volumes represent the
No-Build 2015 scenario since there are no future adjacent developments.


3.2.2.   Build Condition
In order to determine peak hour traffic volumes with the development, the total peak hour site
traffic (Figure 6) was combined with the No-Build 2015 traffic volumes (Figure 7) to determine
Build 2015 traffic volumes. The Build 2015 traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 8.


4.       TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
4.1.     Traffic Analysis Procedure
All study intersections were analyzed using the methodology outlined in the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board. A computer software package,
Synchro (Version 7), was used to complete the analyses for all of the study area intersections.
Synchro 7 was developed by Trafficware Corporation and allows the user to input data into the
Synchro software and calculate the output based on methodologies in the HCM.


The capacity analysis for an unsignalized intersection does not provide an overall level of service
for the intersection, but rather a level of service for movements and/or approaches that have a
conflicting movement. Capacity and level of service are the design criteria for this traffic study.


The HCM defines capacity as “the maximum hourly rate at which persons or vehicles can
reasonably be expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a given
time period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions”. Level of service (LOS) is a
term used to represent different driving conditions, and is defined as a “qualitative measure
describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, and their perception by motorists and/or
passengers”. Level of service varies from Level “A” representing free flow, to Level “F” where
greater vehicle delays are evident.


                                                  4
                                         Courtyards On Nantz Development –Traffic Impact Study

Refer to Table 2 for HCM levels of service and related average control delay per vehicle for both
signalized and unsignalized intersections. Control delay as defined by the HCM includes “initial
deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay”. As shown in
Table 2, an average control delay of 40 seconds at a signalized intersection results in a LOS D
operation.

4.2.     Capacity and Level of Service at Study Intersections
4.2.1.   Catawba Avenue and Nantz Road
Nantz Road intersects Catawba Avenue forming a three-leg intersection. Catawba Avenue is free-
flowing and Nantz Road is stop controlled. Capacity analysis results indicate that the northbound
Catawba Avenue left turn movement currently operates at LOS B during both peak hours. The
Nantz Road approach currently operates at LOS F due to the high volume on Catawba Avenue. No
change in LOS is expected on Catawba Avenue in the future no-build and build scenarios. Delay is
expected to increase on Nantz Road in the future no-build and build scenarios due to the increased
traffic on all approaches. Refer to Table 3 for a summary of the capacity analysis results. Refer to
Appendix C for the Synchro capacity analysis reports.


Nantz Road may be realigned in the future to form a less skewed intersection with Catawba
Avenue. The proposed site plan has taken this into consideration; providing enough open space for
the realignment of Nantz Road.




                                                 5
                                                              Courtyards On Nantz Development –Traffic Impact Study

A traffic signal warrant analysis was performed for the intersection. The No-Build 2015 volumes
are not expected to meet any signal warrant. The hourly volumes on Catawba Avenue are very
high, while several of the Nantz Road hourly volumes are just below the threshold for warranting a
traffic signal. The Build 2015 scenario increases the volume on Nantz Road just enough to meet
Warrant 3: Peak hour. Based on discussions with NCDOT, traffic signals on state roads are
generally not permitted or recommended when only the peak hour warrant is met, except in
extenuating circumstances. It is recommended that a signal be installed when some combination of
peak hour warrant and either four or eight hour warrants are met. Refer to Appendix C for the
signal warrant reports.


No improvements are recommended at this intersection. A traffic signal is not recommended due
to the low volumes on Nantz Road. Furthermore, a traffic signal would increase delay on Catawba
Avenue. No geometric improvements are recommended due to the low turning volumes.

4.2.2.      Nantz Road and Office Driveway
Capacity analysis results at the unsignalized intersection of Nantz Road and the office driveway
indicate that the proposed site driveway is expected to operate at LOS A during both peak hours.
The eastbound left turn movement from Nantz Road is also expected to operate at LOS A during
both peak hours. No turn lanes are recommended at this intersection due to the low turning
volumes. Refer to Table 4 for a summary of the capacity analysis results. Refer to Appendix D for
the Synchro capacity analysis reports.

5.          CONCLUSIONS
This report summarizes the findings of the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) that was performed for the
Courtyards on Nantz Development that is proposed along the north side of Nantz Road, west of
Catawba Avenue in Cornelius, North Carolina. The purpose of this study is to determine the
potential impact to the surrounding transportation system caused by the traffic generated by the
proposed development.


The Courtyards on Nantz Development is proposed to consist of 63 single-family detached homes
for senior adults and 8,000 square feet of medical-dental office space. Two site driveways would
be located on Nantz Road. Each driveway would form an unsignalized three-leg intersection. The
western driveway would provide access to the residential portion of the development. The eastern
driveway would provide access to the office building. For purposes of this study, it is assumed that
the development will be fully built out by 2015.


                                                                         8

5.1.    Summary of Recommended Improvements
Based on the analysis results, no improvements are recommended. The proposed site is expected
to generate approximately 60 trips during each peak hour. The traffic signal warrant analysis
concluded that only the peak hour warrant is expected to be met during the Build 2015 scenario. A
traffic signal is not recommended due to the low volume on Nantz Road. No geometric
improvements are recommended due to the low turning volumes.

Transportation Impact Analysis



INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the anticipated transportation impacts associated with the proposed Simpson
Pavilion, as required by the City of Bend Development Code Chapter 4.7. The Bend Park and Recreation
District (BPRD) plans to build a 39,555 square foot (including the court area and support buildings)
open-air, covered pavilion. The pavilion will have the ability to host both summer and winter sports
under various configurations.

The pavilion will be located in the northwest quadrant of the Simpson Avenue/Colorado Avenue
roundabout, with access from Bradbury Street, as shown in Figure 1. BPRD estimates that the facility
will be open in Fall 2015.

The pavilion will be located on 3.26 acres within a larger parcel (approximately 10-acres) that was
rezoned from Industrial (IL) to Mixed Employment (ME) in 2008. The City approved the zone change
and plan amendment from IL to ME with several conditions of approval, documented in Restricted
Covenant PZ 06-570 and Ordinance NS-2105. The conditions of the ordinance were based on a trip
generation analysis for a reasonable worst-case development within the proposed ME zone. This
analysis assumed a trip generation potential of 469 p.m. peak hour trips for the 10-acre parcel under
the ME zone designation. A Scoping Memo was submitted to the City on February 17, 2014 that
provided documentation of the trip generation potential for the Simpson Pavilion, which is substantially
lower than the total trip generation estimate upon which the ordinance was based. Therefore, the City
of Bend and BPRD are in the process of negotiating an amendment to the conditions that would allow
construction of the Simpson Pavilion without completion of all the conditions identified in Ordinance
NS-2105. Based on discussions with City staff prior to April 2014, the Transportation Impact Analysis
was based on the following assumptions for the transportation-applicable ordinance conditions:

         Condition #2: Simpson Avenue/Mt. Washington Drive: A roundabout was constructed at this
          intersection and satisfies the ordinance conditions. No additional improvements will be done at
          this intersection.
         Condition #3: Simpson Avenue/Century Drive: BPRD will contribute funding to the City for the
          upgrade of this roundabout to better accommodate trucks and fire access. It is assumed that
          the westbound approach will be widened to 20 feet.
         Condition #4: Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street: City staff approved the analysis presented in
          the Scoping Memo that the existing configuration of the all-way stop-controlled intersection at
          Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street has sufficient excess capacity beyond year 2020. For this
          analysis, it was assumed that the intersection would remain an all-way stop-controlled
          intersection with minor safety improvements to reduce crash-risk in the future.
         Condition #5: Columbia Street/Colorado Street: The majority of these improvements have been
          completed prior to date. No additional improvements will be made at this intersection.
         Condition #6: Columbia/Commerce Gateway Treatment: BPRD plans to construct bulb-outs on
          Columbia Street based on neighborhood concerns regarding cut-through traffic.

Transportation Impact Analysis



STUDY PERIODS AND STANDARDS
The City of Bend’s Development Code, Chapter 4.7, requires that any arterial/collector intersections
within a one-mile driving distance of the site that have more than 15 peak hour trips added to a lane
group be studied, in addition to driveway access points and street connection points to abutting
arterials or collectors. The City requires impacts to be evaluated without development impacts for the
opening year (2015), with development impacts for the opening year, and with development impacts
five years after opening (2020) for planning purposes.

As documented in this report and in the Scoping Memo, the study intersections identified for this
analysis include:

          Simpson Pavilion Driveway/Bradbury Street (two-way stop-controlled intersection);
          Simpson Avenue/Bradbury Street (two-way stop-controlled intersection);
          Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street (all-way stop-controlled intersection).1

The City of Bend’s Development Code, Chapter 4.7, specifies the following operations standards for
two-way stop controlled and all-way stop controlled intersections:

          Two-Way Stop Control – Approaches with greater than 100 peak hour trips; average delay for
           the critical lane group is less than or equal to 50 seconds during the Peak Hour;
          All-Way Stop Control – Average delay for the intersection as a whole is less than or equal to 80
           seconds during the Peak Hour.




1
    The intersection of Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street does not meet the City’s requirement to be studied because no
lane groups experience an addition of at least 15 peak hour trips associated with the development. This intersection is
included in the analysis due to the project history.

Transportation Impact Analysis



EXISTING CONDITIONS
The site of the proposed Simpson Pavilion borders Colorado Avenue, Simpson Avenue, and Bradbury
Street, as shown in Exhibit 1. The area immediate northeast of the proposed Simpson Pavilion is
currently vacant, and the area west of the site is a large parking lot, the former Mt. Bachelor Park and
Ride Lot. The area north and south of the site contains a mixture of residential and office uses.

Figure 2 summarizes the existing intersection configurations. The characteristics of the roadways
adjacent to the site are summarized in Table 1. Connected sidewalks are located on all adjacent
roadways and provide connections between the Simpson Pavilion and downtown, the 14th Street
corridor, the future OSU Cascades site, and McKay Park. Bicycle lanes are located on Simpson Avenue
and Colorado Avenue. Bicycle lanes are not appropriate for Bradbury Street because traffic volumes
and speeds are low enough that bicycles are expected to share the lane. The City of Bend’s Standards
and Specifications (Part II, Section 3.4.2.2) state that bicycle lanes are generally not provided on local
streets.2

Cascades East Transit offers transit service Monday through Friday between 7:20 a.m. and 5:56 p.m.
Route 11 has a stop located at Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street and provides connections to the
proposed OSU Cascades site as well as downtown Bend and the Hawthorne transit station, as shown in
Exhibit 2.

Existing Traffic Counts
Traffic counts were conducted at Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street on Thursday, November 21, 2013
between the hours of 4:00 and 5:00 p.m., which was determined to be the system peak hour based on
hourly data collected from tube counts in November 2013. Traffic volumes at the intersection of
Simpson Avenue/Bradbury Street were estimated using the surrounding intersection volumes. Figure 3
summarizes the existing traffic counts. All traffic count data is contained in Appendix 1.


Existing Conditions Operations Analysis
In order to show how the system currently operates, intersection operational analyses were performed
using the existing counts at the study intersections. All operational analyses were conducted using
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 Methodologies. As shown in Figure 3, both existing study
intersections currently operate acceptably during the p.m. peak hour. Existing Conditions analysis
worksheets are provided in Appendix 2.


Safety Analysis
Year 2008 through 2012 crash records were obtained from ODOT for each of the two existing study
intersections. Reportable crashes are those that involve personal injury or more than $1,500 in
property damage. This information was reviewed to identify patterns and trends within the data that
could be indicators for operational or geometric improvement needs. There were eight reported
crashes at Simpson Avenue and Columbia Street over the five-year time period analyzed. Approximately
63% of the crashes cited passing the stop sign as the primary crash cause. Motorists passing the stop
sign without stopping were equally spread between the eastbound and westbound approaches. ODOT
crash data is provided in Appendix 3.

Based on a review of the crash data, intersection treatments to improve intersection visibility and
driver expectation at the Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street intersection are recommended to reduce
the number of crashes due to motorists passing the stop sign.

FUTURE CONDITIONS
The Simpson Pavilion is expected to be completed by Fall 2015 and open to the public. To determine
potential transportation impacts associated with the development, an analysis was conducted to
determine the incremental impact of the Simpson Pavilion to future intersection operations.


2015 Background Conditions
Intersection operations for the two study intersections were evaluated for the opening year (2015)
conditions with and without the addition of the Simpson Pavilion. The background conditions reflect
traffic conditions without the addition of the Simpson Pavilion and serve as a comparison for the
intersection operations with the Simpson Pavilion.

A 1.5% annual growth rate was calculated based on TPAU’s travel demand model, used for the TRIP97
project, and tube counts conducted in November 2013. The growth rate was calculated based on tube
counts conducted on the west side (Mt. Washington Drive, Simpson Avenue, and Century Drive) and
future year model volumes, when the counts and model results were within a reasonable range of one
another. As documented in the Scoping Memo, the calculated growth rate was 1.3%, which was
rounded up to 1.5% to provide a more conservative growth estimate. The 1.5% growth rate was applied
to the 2013 counts to calculate 2015 background volumes. Although other projects are concurrently in
the process of obtaining approval on the west side of Bend, none have been approved at this time.
Therefore, in-process trips from these developments were not incorporated into the 2015 traffic
conditions. Growth rate calculations are included in Appendix 5.

Using these 2015 background volumes, an intersection operational analysis was performed for the two
study intersections. As shown in Figure 4, all study intersections operate within City standards in 2015
without the addition of the Simpson Pavilion traffic. Analysis worksheets for the 2015 Background
Conditions are provided in Appendix 4.

Proposed Development
The proposed pavilion is designed with the potential to serve multiple sports under different
configurations. The court area under the pavilion will be 28,800 square feet, and the support buildings
will provide an additional 10,755 square feet of space, for a total facility size of 39,555 square feet.
During winter months, the Simpson Pavilion will contain an 85’ x 200’ ice rink that is expected to serve
activities such as local hockey leagues and open skate for the public. During summer months, the
pavilion can be configured to allow for a combination of the following sports, as shown in Exhibit 3:

         Basketball: Up to four basketball courts;
         Tennis Courts: Up to four tennis courts;
         Volleyball: Up to four volleyball courts;
          Pickleball: Up to 16 pickleball courts.

Site Access and Circulation
Access to the Simpson Pavilion will be provided from Bradbury Street via two driveways, as shown in
Exhibit 3. Although pavilion traffic will use both driveways, traffic was assumed to use one driveway for
the purpose of analyzing how the driveway will perform under a worst-case scenario. These driveways
both serve two-way traffic and provide for adequate circulation within the parking lot. A drop-off area

is located on the south side of the parking lot and enables parents to safely drop off children along the
curb without parking.

The intersection sight distance exceeds minimum requirements of 280 feet for a design speed of 25
mph at both driveways on Bradbury Street. Landscaping and vegetation along Bradbury Street should
be designed and maintained to ensure the 280 feet sight distance requirements are maintained.

Figure 5 shows the pedestrian and bicycle connections between the Simpson Pavilion site and the
nearby attractions. As shown on the map, multimodal connections exist between the proposed
Simpson Pavilion and nearby McKay park, the Old Mill District, Downtown Bend, and the 14 th Street
corridor. These connections will encourage multimodal trips to the Simpson Pavilion.


Trip Generation
The Simpson Pavilion will be used for several activities throughout the year including ice skating,
hockey, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and pickleball. Each of these uses has a different trip generation
rate. The standard rates, obtained from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation,
9th Edition, are summarized in Table 2 for the uses available. No standard rate was available for
pickleball, volleyball, or basketball courts, and multipurpose recreational facilities shown in the ITE Trip
Generation manual were not appropriate for the proposed site.

* Trip generation rate for ice skating rinks was based on only one study. No daily rates are available.
^Data from only three sites was used to develop the tennis courts trip generation rates. Directional distribution is not available.


Because the winter use (ice skating) has a higher trip generation potential and corresponds with the
traffic counts taken in November, we conducted intersection operational evaluations using the trip
generation estimate for the ice skating rink.

The ITE trip generation data for ice skating rinks is based on only one study of a site that is almost twice
the size of the proposed pavilion and likely includes additional amenities such as arcades, concessions,
and spectator seating. Without additional data points, it is unclear whether the relationship between
facility size and number of trips is a linear or exponential rate. In order to estimate a more appropriate
trip generation rate, tube counts were conducted at the Bill Collier Ice Arena in Klamath Falls, Oregon.
The Bill Collier Ice Arena is an open air pavilion similar to the proposed Simpson Pavilion. The ice rink is
85’ x 200’, equivalent to the proposed Simpson Pavilion ice rink. Unlike the proposed Simpson Pavilion
site, the Bill Collier Ice Arena is not served by transit and its location does not support a high level of
multimodal trip making.

Tube counts were conducted at the Bill Collier Ice Arena between Wednesday, January 29th and Sunday,
February 2nd, 2014 to determine the number of trips in and out of the ice arena parking lot. In
accordance with the City of Bend’s Development Code, Chapter 4.7, the weekday p.m. peak hour was
evaluated to determine the maximum number of trips per hour that occurred on Wednesday or
Thursday between the hours of 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. The maximum number of trips per hour occurred
between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, with a total of 35 trips. However, the daily peak occurred
slightly later, between the hours of 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. when 42 trips were counted. According to the
Bill Collier Ice Arena’s schedule, hockey practices were occurring during this time. The typical schedule
for Thursday events is summarized in Table 3.

Due to the differences in size and characteristics of the site used in the ITE standard rate, we used the
trip generation estimate obtained from the Bill Collier Ice Arena in Klamath Falls. The ice arena is the
same size as the proposed pavilion and serves a similar function as a regional ice facility for team sports
and open skate in the area. Although the maximum number of trips recorded during the standard 4:00
to 6:00 p.m. period was 35 trips, we used an estimate of 42 trips, the maximum count between 6:00
and 7:00 p.m., to provide a conservative estimate of trip generation potential. Table 4 summarizes the
estimated trip generation by direction based on the data collected in Klamath Falls.

Trip Distribution
The trip distribution pattern was developed based on existing traffic patterns and the understanding
that the pavilion will serve as a local as well as regional attraction when the ice rink is in place. The
majority of people traveling to the pavilion from areas north and east of the site are likely to use
Colorado Avenue to access the site, while those traveling from south and southeast areas of the City
are likely to use Columbia Street to cross the Deschutes River and access the site. With the parkway
located east of the site, it was assumed that a majority (60%) of trips would begin or end east of the
site. The remaining 40% were distributed throughout the west side based on residential neighborhood
locations and attractions. Figure 6 illustrates the estimated trip distribution and assignment to nearby
intersections.

according to the City of Bend Development Code are Bradbury Street/Simpson Avenue and Bradbury
Street/Simpson Pavilion Driveway. However, the intersection of Columbia Street/Simpson Avenue was
also analyzed due to project history.

Transportation Impact Analysis


Future Conditions Operations Analysis
Site-generated trips, shown in Figure 6, were added to the 2015 background traffic volumes to obtain
2015 build condition traffic volumes. The resulting traffic volumes and intersection operations are
shown in Figure 7. All study intersections are expected to operate within City standards in 2015 with
the addition of Simpson Pavilion trips.

The City of Bend also requires a five-year analysis beyond opening year to assist in the planning of
capital improvements. As shown in Figure 8, the study intersections are predicted to continue operating
within City standards in 2020 with the addition of site-generated trips, assuming a 1.5% growth rate.

Operational analysis worksheets for 2015 Build Conditions and 2020 Build Conditions are provided in
Appendix 6 and Appendix 7, respectively.


2020 Build Conditions, with OSU Cascades
OSU Cascades has submitted an application to the City of Bend for the first 10-acres of development for
a 4-year university at the northwest corner of the roundabout at Century Drive and Chandler Avenue.
Although this application has not been approved and, therefore, is not required to be included as
background traffic, there has been interest from the public concerning the traffic associated with the
campus. To address these concerns, we conducted additional analysis to show how the intersections
are predicted to operate with traffic from OSU Cascades Phase 1 and the Simpson Pavilion. The traffic
assumptions associated with this site were obtained from the OSU Cascades Phase 1 TIA submitted to
the City of Bend on March 13, 2014 and reflect a conservative analysis for the maximum capacity of the
university between 2015 and 2020.

As shown in Figure 9, the study intersections are predicted to operate within City standards in 2020
with the inclusion of OSU Cascades trips. Operational analysis worksheets for the 2020 Build Conditions,
with OSU Cascades scenario are provided in Appendix 8.

Transportation Impact Analysis



KEY FINDINGS
Key findings of the analysis are summarized below.

         The existing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure on roadways adjacent to the site provide
          multimodal connections between the proposed site and nearby attractions.
         Based on TPAU travel demand models for the area, a growth rate of 1.5% was calculated and
          used to estimate future background traffic volumes.
         Trip generation for the proposed Simpson Pavilion will vary between summer and winter uses.
          The winter use, ice skating, is expected to be the highest trip generation potential and,
          therefore, was used for analysis. Based on data collected from a similar site in Klamath Falls,
          Oregon, the expected number of trips generated during the p.m. peak hour is 35 trips.
          However, the weekday peak hour of generator occurred between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. with 42
          trips. This analysis was conducted assuming a trip generation of 42 p.m. peak hour trips to
          provide a conservative estimate.
         Based on trip generation and distribution, the only intersections required to be studied
          according to the City of Bend Development Code, Chapter 4.7, are Simpson Pavilion
          Driveway/Bradbury Street and Simpson Avenue/Bradbury Street. The intersection of Simpson
          Avenue/Columbia Street was also studied due to the history and ordinance conditions
          associated with the site.
         The intersection of Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street has experienced a relatively high number
          of crashes, with a large percentage due to drivers failing to stop at the stop sign.
         All study intersections are expected to operate acceptably under 2015 and 2020 conditions with
          the addition of Simpson Pavilion traffic as well as predicted OSU Cascades traffic.


RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the key findings of this analysis, the following recommendations are intended to support the
development of the Simpson Pavilion.

         Landscaping and vegetation should be designed and maintained in a manner that ensures
          adequate (280’) sight distance at both driveways to the Simpson Pavilion on Bradbury Street.
         The intersection of Simpson Avenue/Columbia Street should be maintained as an all-way stop-
          controlled intersection. Intersection safety improvements, such as striping and signage
          improvements, to increase intersection visibility and driver awareness should be completed to
          reduce the number of crashes due to drivers failing to stop at the stop sign.
         Pending completion of negotiations with the City of Bend, BPRD should complete the following
          additional improvements required by the Ordinance:
             o Gateway treatments at Columbia Street/Commerce Avenue.
             o Contribution to improvements at the roundabout at Simpson Avenue/Century Drive.

Disclaimer: A higher number of crashes may be reported as of 2011 compared to prior years. This does not reflect an increase in annual crashes. The higher numbers result
from a change to an internal departmental process that allows the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit to add previously unavailable, non-fatal crash reports to the annual data file.
Please be aware of this change when comparing pre-2011 crash statistics.

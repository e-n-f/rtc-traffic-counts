1.     INTRODUCTION
Waimānalo Health Center (WHC), which celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2012,
proposes to construct a new two-story outpatient health care facility on State of
Hawaiʻi property identified as Tax Map Key (TMK) 4-1-009: 282 adjacent to the
Waimānalo Fire Station and across from Waimānalo Elementary and Intermediate
School. The triangular parcel (hereinafter referred to as “Parcel 282”) where new
construction would occur comprises approximately 1.085 acres and contains an
existing unimproved parking lot and overgrown vegetation. WHC employees are
authorized to utilize the parking lot on Parcel 282 pursuant to the standards and
conditions of the management right-of-entry (PSF 12OD-087) granted by the Board
of Land and Natural Resources at its meeting on August 24, 2012.

Construction of the new health care facility and additional patient parking spaces
would allow WHC to relocate and expand clinical services from existing buildings
located at 41-1347 Kalanianaʻole Highway on State of Hawaiʻi property identified as
TMK 4-1-009: 279 adjacent to St. George Church. The demolition of select old
structures on the 1.081 acre parcel (hereinafter referred to as “Parcel 279”) would
occur after WHC successfully transitions medical, behavioral health, vision,
pharmacy, nutrition, outreach and eligibility services to the completed facility.

In 1966, pilot projects run by the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Health (DOH)
brought maternal and child health services to Waimānalo. The DOH ran the
combined Maternal and Infant Care/Children and Youth Project from its Waimānalo
health clinic for twenty years. The decision to terminate those DOH services in
Waimānalo led to the establishment of the community-based WHC, which was
incorporated in January 1989. DOH facilities were transferred to WHC and
renovated, which allowed WHC to accept its first patient in January 1992. In 1994,
the WHC earned its designation as a Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that
functions under the supervision of the Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. FQHCs that are community health centers provide comprehensive primary
and preventive care to persons of all ages, regardless of their health insurance
status or ability to pay. WHC operates within the geographic area of Waimānalo,
which has a federal designation from the HRSA as a Medically Underserved
Population and Health Professional Shortage Area.

WHC operates as a domestic non-profit and 501(c)(3) organization that qualifies for
direct lease pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) Section 171-43.1. Its
current 35-year lease, GL-5400, for Parcel 279 commenced on September 1, 1995
and expires on August 31, 2030. WHC is in compliance with the terms and
conditions of GL-5400 and is seeking a new 65-year direct lease as part of the
undertaking for the expanded health care facility. GL-5400 would be mutually
terminated in the event the new 65-year lease is granted.




November 2013                                                                         1-1
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



The project would use State of Hawaiʻi lands and, therefore, requires the preparation
of an EA pursuant to Chapter 343, HRS and associated Title 11, Chapter 200,
Hawaiʻi Administrative Rules (HAR). This Environmental Assessment (EA) was
prepared to address environmental, social, and economic consequences of the
project and to provide for public participation as required and defined in the statutes.

The City and County of Honolulu, Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP)
provided the following comments pertaining to the expanded health care facility
project in its letter dated October 2, 2013:
          The expanded care facility is a “public use and structure” because the
           WHC provides general health care services to the community under
           agreements with the DOH to fulfill specific functions for the public good as
           authorized by State law;
          Public uses and structures are permitted in the R-5 Residential District;
          There are no specific parking requirements for a public use and structure;
          Parking for a public use and structure will be determined by the DPP
           Director;
          The project site is located within the Special Management Area (SMA),
           and is therefore subject to the regulations of the SMA Ordinance found in
           Chapter 25 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu;
          The proposal will require approval of a SMA Use Permit (Major); and
          The first phase of the SMA Use Permit (Major) application process is the
           preparation and acceptance of an EA.

This EA was prepared to concurrently address the first phase of the SMA Use
Permit (Major) application process pursuant to the regulations of the SMA Ordinance
found in Chapter 25 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu. It is anticipated that the
SMA Use Permit (Major) will be obtained during the design phase of the project.

2.     SETTING AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1.   Project Need and Objectives
The WHC is the only medical provider in the Koʻolau Poko area that serves the
uninsured. Koʻolau Poko encompasses the windward coastal and valley areas from
Makapuʻu Point to Kaoio Point at the northern end of Kāneʻohe Bay and includes the
rural communities of Kahaluʻu, Waiāhole-Waikane, Kualoa, and Waimānalo and the
urban fringe communities of Kāneʻohe and Kailua. Physicians and practitioners at
the WHC accept MedQuest or Quest Expanded Access and offer a sliding fee
discount for services. Medical personnel at WHC include physicians, nurse
practitioners specializing in family medicine, a pediatrician, care coordinators, a
dentist, a dental hygienist, dental assistants, licensed clinical psychologists in
behavioral health, registered dieticians, and outreach and eligibility workers. Access
to health care and social services would be severely limited if the WHC did not exist,
whereby Waimānalo residents would need to travel beyond the community for
services.

Existing facilities located within Parcel 279 are inefficiently configured and
inadequately sized based on modern standards for patient care. The repair and
maintenance of old facilities continues to escalate, which adversely impacts the
delivery of much-needed services.

Completion of the project would allow WHC to achieve the following objectives:
          House medical, behavioral health, vision, pharmacy, nutrition, outreach
           and eligibility services in a modern health care facility that may incorporate
           solar energy and sustainable design concepts;
          Implement Patient-Centered Health Care Home-style (PCHCH) concepts
           with properly configured and adequately sized examination rooms and
           support areas;
          Improve the delivery of coordinated patient care services;
          Reduce barriers and increase access to health care; and
          Continue its mission of providing health services to the medically
           underserved population of Waimānalo which has a high concentration of
           Native Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian families.

2.2.   Project Location
Parcels 279 and 282 are located along Kalanianaʻole Highway in Koʻolau Poko and
adjacent to military lands on the windward side of the island of Oʻahu. The existing
WHC campus on Parcel 279 is located at 41-1347 Kalanianaʻole Highway across

School (see Figure 1). WHC has a 35-year direct lease for Parcel 279 (GL-5400,
which expires on August 31, 2030) from the State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Land
and Natural Resources (DLNR). On August 24, 2012, the Board of Land and Natural
Resources granted WHC a right-of-entry permit (PSF 12OD-087) for Parcel 282.
WHC employees currently utilize Parcel 282 for parking. St. George Church and the
Waimānalo Fire Station lie between the two state-owned parcels.

2.3.   Site Description
Parcel 279 is currently utilized by the WHC for the delivery of health care services to
its patients. The 1.081-acre parcel is bounded by residential housing to the west,
Marine Corps Training Area Bellows (MCTAB) land to the north, St. George Church
to the east, and Kalanianaʻole Highway to the south. The existing WHC campus on
Parcel 279 consists of old trailers and buildings arranged in a U-shaped
configuration around a parking lot. Vehicular access to and egress from the WHC
campus is via a driveway along Kalanianaʻole Highway.

Parcel 282 is currently utilized by the WHC as a parking lot for its employees. The
triangular parcel is relatively flat, its western portion is undeveloped (mostly covered
by gravel), and the eastern portion is overgrown with vegetation. Parcel 282 is
bounded by the Waimānalo Fire Station to the west, MCTAB lands to the north and
east, and Kalanianaʻole Highway to the south. Parcel 282 is 47,265 square feet in
area. A 25-foot wide easement in favor of the Hawaiian Electric Company currently
runs through the parcel. Vehicular access to and egress from the 1.085-acre parcel
is via a driveway along Kalanianaʻole Highway. City and County of Honolulu zoning
requirements for R-5 Residential include a 30-foot front yard setback, 15-foot
side/rear yard setback requirements, and a 25-foot building height limit.

2.5.   Socio-Economic Setting
Information pertaining to the socio-economic setting is hereby excerpted from the
Koʻolau Poko Watershed Management Plan (Townscape, Inc., 2012), which
examined the watershed planning district on windward Oʻahu from Kualoa in the
north to Makapuʻu Point in the south. Summarized information that pertains to
Waimānalo is from this plan unless otherwise indicated.

The earliest Hawaiians who settled on the windward coast of Oʻahu developed a
food production system that utilized naturally occurring fresh water resources in the
Koʻolau Poko area. The abundance of food contributed to the region’s importance as
one of the major population centers where several ruling chiefs (including Olopana,
Kahekili, and Kamehameha the Great) resided during the pre-contact era of Hawaiʻi.
Widespread epidemics and outbreaks that affected all of Hawaiʻi caused severe
population declines in Koʻolau Poko during the 1800s. It is estimated that the
population decreased by over 90 percent from 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants in the
late 18th century to slightly over 2,000 inhabitants in 1872.

The concepts of private land ownership led to vast changes in settlement patterns in
Hawaiʻi. Large tracts of land in the Koʻolau Poko area were sold or leased for
monocrop agricultural ventures (e.g., sugar, rice and pineapple) and livestock and
ranching activities. The population of Koʻolau Poko began to grow again as
immigrant laborers settled in the district. Waimānalo Sugar Plantation was one of
nine sugar plantations in Koʻolau Poko. It operated for 70 years from 1878 to 1947
and encompassed roughly 3,000 acres of land extending six miles along the
Waimānalo coast and four miles inland to the base of the Koʻolau Mountain Range.
The plantation was founded in 1877 by John A. Cummins. In 1885, the plantation
passed to W.G. Irwin who was instrumental in the construction of the ditch irrigation
system that diverted water from streams and springs to plantation lands. The
destructive effects of cattle and ranching activities on vegetation and forested areas
in Koʻolau Poko eventually led to the establishment of forest reserve areas by the
Territorial Government of Hawaiʻi. Waimānalo Forest Reserve includes 7,395 acres
in the mauka portions of Waimānalo, Kailua and southern Kāneʻohe.

Residential population growth in Waimānalo followed the construction of the Kailua
to Waimānalo Road in 1924. The first Hawaiian Homes development in Waimānalo
began in 1925 and was followed by the Waimānalo beach lot homes in 1926.

The military, which had established Waimānalo Military Reservation in 1917,
completed its facility in 1938 and later changed its name to Bellows Air Force Station
to commemorate Second Lieutenant Franklin B. Bellows, who died in combat during




November 2013                                                                          2-6

World War I. In 1999, the U.S. Marine Corps acquired 1,049 acres of land for a
training area from the Air Force whereby MCTAB now falls under the jurisdiction of
Marine Corps Base Hawaiʻi (State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Transportation, Airports
Division, n.d.).

Waimānalo has mostly retained its rural character as compared to other urbanized
areas of Koʻolau Poko, which experienced tremendous housing and population
growth from the 1950s through the 1980s. Development in Waimānalo has occurred
at a slower pace in part because much of the Waimānalo Sugar Plantation lands
were passed to the Territorial and then the State government.

2.6.   Waimānalo Area Uses, Tenants, and Structures
Waimānalo town is generally characterized as a rural residential community with
small commercial businesses, recreational areas and agricultural uses. The area
closest to Parcels 279 and 282 contains residential neighborhoods, commercial
businesses, St. George Catholic Church, and public facilities including the
Waimānalo Fire Station (Company 27), Waimānalo Public Library, Waimānalo
Elementary and Intermediate School, and Waimānalo District Park (see Figure 2).
MCTAB lands located makai or seaward of Parcels 279 and 282 are primarily
utilized for recreation and for military training. Areas beyond Parcel 282 towards
Makapuʻu comprise residential neighborhoods, agricultural lots used for plant
nurseries, and recreational areas. Other nearby recreational uses that contribute to
the rural character of the Waimānalo area include Bellows Field Beach Park (which
is part of MCTAB), Waimānalo Bay Beach Park (which was formerly known as
Waimānalo State Recreation Area), and a polo field with related facilities located on
State land along Kalanianaʻole Highway.

2.7.   Environmental Characteristics
The proposed project includes the following considerations:
          Determinations from the traffic impact analysis would be used to guide
           modifications to traffic and circulation patterns in the vicinity of Parcel 282
           from improved access and egress for the expanded health care facility.
          The creation of additional patient parking on Parcel 282 would necessitate
           the removal of existing vegetation; however, the project includes
           landscaping with trees and other plants that are appropriate to the climate
           of Waimānalo.
          The expanded health care facility consisting of a new two-story structure
           on Parcel 282 would add a visual element along Kalanianaʻole Highway.
           The new facility will not exceed the 25-foot building height limitations.
          An electrical easement encumbered under GL-5366 to Hawaiian Electric
           Company, Inc. that expires on December 31, 2061 would be relocated



November 2013                                                                            2-7
Draft EA                              Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



           within Parcel 282. It is anticipated that WHC would be responsible for the
           total cost of relocating the electrical easement within Parcel 282.
          The expanded health care facility would require new connections and/or
           extensions for basic infrastructure services and systems (i.e., water,
           wastewater, power and communications).
          Construction-related activities affecting Parcel 282 and demolition of old
           structures on Parcel 279 would generate short-term effects such as
           erosion, surface runoff, fugitive dust, noise, intermittent traffic, solid waste,
           and potential disruptions to utility services that would cease upon project
           completion.

2.8.   Project Schedule and Cost
The design phase of the proposed project is projected to continue through July
2014. Completion of the environmental review process in March 2014 may allow
construction of the new facility to commence in January 2015 with project completion
in 2017. The estimated total project cost is $13 million.

3.     DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING ENVIRONMENT, PROJECT IMPACTS, AND
       MITIGATION
3.1.   Climate and Air Quality
Parcels 279 and 282 are located on the windward portion of Oʻahu, which is
characterized by mild temperatures and abundant rainfall, especially during the
wetter months of November through February. Between 1969 and 2013, the
recorded monthly average temperatures in Waimānalo ranged from 64 degrees to
85 degrees Fahrenheit and the average rainfall was 43 inches per year (Western
Regional Climate Center, n.d.). Trade winds in the project vicinity are generally from
the northeast. Strong winds are known to occur in connection with storm systems
that disrupt climatic patterns.

Air quality in the State of Hawaiʻi consistently meets National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency per
requirements of the Clean Air Act and State Ambient Air Quality Standards (SAAQS)
established by the DOH. The State standards for select parameters are more
stringent than their Federal counterparts. The NAAQS and SAAQS are periodically
exceeded due to volcanic activity and exceptional events such as New Year’s
fireworks celebrations.

The ambient air quality at Parcels 279 and 282 may be affected by activities near the
project site, such as automobile traffic along Kalanianaʻole Highway. The project site
is located in a rural area that is positively influenced by northeast trade winds that
disperse emissions and other air quality pollutants.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       The demolition of older buildings on Parcel 279 and the construction of the
       expanded health care facility on Parcel 282 will have no effect on climatic
       conditions such that no mitigation measures are necessary.

       The proposed project is expected to generate short-term construction-related
       impacts on air quality such as fugitive dust and emissions from construction
       vehicles and equipment. The contractor will be responsible for complying with
       HAR Title 11, Chapter 60, “Air Pollution Control.” The contractor will be
       responsible for the implementation of adequate dust control measures during
       all phases of development and construction activities.

       Construction equipment and vehicles shall be properly maintained in order to
       control vehicular emissions. Exhaust emissions from construction equipment
       and vehicles are anticipated to have negligible impacts on air quality in the
       project vicinity since the carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
       would be intermittent and readily dissipated.



November 2013                                                                          3-1
Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



       Overall, air quality impacts during construction will be temporary in nature and
       will cease upon completion of the construction. No significant adverse air
       quality is anticipated upon completion and during operation of the proposed
       project.

3.2.   Geology and Soils
Information pertaining to the general geology of the Waimānalo area is hereby
excerpted from the geology discussion in the Final Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement for the Waimanalo Wastewater Facilities Plan, Koolaupoko, Oahu,
Hawaii (Hawaii Pacific Engineers, Inc., 1998). Basaltic bedrock, alluvium, and
coralline deposits are the three main geological units found in the Waimānalo area.
Coastal plain sediments in the vicinity of Parcels 279 and 282 include an uppermost
layer of sand and coral limestone that may extend to depths of approximately 20 to
30 feet below the surface. The near-surface sand layer is generally very permeable
and capable of transmitting large amounts of water. An impermeable subsurface
layer of clay and alluvium lies beneath the sand stratum and may extend to depths
varying between 35 feet and 100 feet. The alluvium and impermeable sediments are
underlain by over 200 feet of calcareous sediments (e.g., sand, coral and limestone)
that form a permeable zone for the unconfined aquifer stratum. Another layer of
alluvium and impermeable sediments lies below the unconfined aquifer stratum and
serves as a basal confining layer to the caprock aquifer.

According to the Soil Survey of the Islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, and
Lanai, State of Hawaii (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service,
1972) and available soil surveys (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, n.d.), the predominant soil type in the vicinity of Parcels 279
and 282 is classified as Ewa silty clay loam, moderately shallow, 0 to 2 percent
slopes (EmA). The EmA soil type has moderate permeability and very slow runoff
with a slight erosion hazard. The easternmost tip of Parcel 282 is classified as Coral
outcrop (CR), which consists of coral or cemented calcareous sand. The soil
conditions are shown in Figure 3.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       No adverse effects on the underlying geology and soils are anticipated from
       project actions associated with demolition on Parcel 279 and construction on
       Parcel 282. Geotechnical investigations will be performed at specific locations
       targeted for structural improvements (e.g., the building pad) in support of the
       design phase for the expanded two-story health care facility on Parcel 282.
       The findings will be utilized to ensure proper structural design of the new
       building and parking lot with respect to subsurface conditions within the
       footprint of new construction.




November 2013                                                                          3-2

3.3.   Topography
Parcels 279 and 282 contain relatively flat and level terrain (refer to Figure 3). Five
existing one-story structures that house existing WHC functions lie within the
boundaries of Parcel 279. Elevations for Parcel 279 range from 29 feet to 32 feet
above sea level. The western portion of Parcel 282 consists of an unpaved area with
no topographical obstructions that is utilized for parking. The eastern portion of
Parcel 282 is undeveloped and overgrown with vegetation. Elevations for Parcel 282
range from 24 feet to 28 feet above sea level.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       Project actions are anticipated to retain the overall topographic profile of
       affected areas. The demolition of older buildings on Parcel 279 would return
       more of the site to flat open space. Areas that will be affected by construction
       and demolition will be finished and paved to match existing grades to the
       extent possible.

       The western portion of Parcel 282 contains no topographical features that
       would obstruct site preparation activities associated with the building pad for a
       new two-story health care facility. Minor topographical alterations to the site
       would occur from construction activities such as grading. The eastern portion
       of Parcel 282 would be cleared of vegetation and improved for parking. The
       final grading design for Parcel 282 will be based on geotechnical survey
       results that assess soil data and provide recommendations for grading and
       maximum slopes.

3.4.   Water Resources
The project area is within the Waimānalo Aquifer System Area (ASYA) that is part of
the Windward Aquifer Sector Area. The City and County of Honolulu Board of Water
Supply (BWS) has issued Water Use Permits for ground water withdrawals totaling
1.956 million gallons per day (MGD) from the Waimānalo ASYA, which is well below
the 10 MGD sustainable yield for this aquifer system (Townscape, Inc., 2012).
Sustainable yield refers to “the quantity of water that can be extracted from an
aquifer indefinitely without diminishing the quantity or quality of the water withdrawn”
(State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Commission on
Water Resource Management, 2008).

The Underground Injection Control (UIC) line as determined by the DOH Safe
Drinking Water Branch demarcates the boundary between non-drinking water
aquifers and underground sources of drinking water. Parcels 279 and 282 are makai
of the UIC line, which indicates that the underlying groundwater is not considered a
potential source of drinking water.




November 2013                                                                           3-5
Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



The Waimānalo Stream and its tributary, Kahawai Stream, are perennial freshwater
resources in the project area. Sediments, nutrients, chemicals and debris enter the
stream course as it flows from conservation lands at the base of the Koʻolau
Mountain Range through agricultural lots to residential areas and military property
before entering Waimānalo Bay (Townscape, Inc., 2012). There are no freshwater
streams, rivers, ponds or other open water bodies located within or immediately
adjacent to Parcels 279 and 282. Kalanianaʻole Highway crosses over Kahawai
Stream approximately 0.4 miles west of Parcel 279. The intermittent portion of
Inoaole Stream flows under Kalanianaʻole Highway via the concrete bridge structure
located approximately 0.2 miles east of Parcel 282 in the vicinity of Hale Aupuni
Village. “Inoaole Stream is not a natural stream, but rather a drainage that was
constructed as a result of sugarcane cultivation in the area” (Group 70 International,
2011). Waimānalo Bay is no less than 0.6 miles makai or seaward of Parcels 279
and 282.

There are no wetlands (or marshes, swamps, bogs, etc.) located within or
immediately adjacent to Parcels 279 and 282. There are designated wetlands at
least 0.2 miles east of Parcel 282 along Inoaole Stream (U.S. Fish and Widlife
Service, 2013).

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       The new health care facility on Parcel 282 does not involve the development
       of new potable water sources. Parcel 282 is located within an area served by
       existing municipal systems for potable water and wastewater disposal (refer
       to the discussion in Section 3.12 Utilities). The long-term use of Parcels 279
       and 282 is not anticipated to result in contamination of the underlying aquifer
       and groundwater sources in the Waimānalo ASYA.

       No significant increase in water consumption is anticipated since project
       actions would primarily relocate personnel who are already drawing from the
       same water source. Staffing projections for the WHC suggest that providing
       primary and preventive health services to the community could result in the
       need for approximately fourteen (14) additional employees in the future.

       Project actions are not anticipated to have any impact on surface water
       resources since Parcels 279 and 282 are devoid of such resources. A short-
       term and temporary impact of the project would occur from dewatering
       activities and the generation of additional surface runoff during construction
       and demolition work, especially if heavy rains coincide with ground
       disturbance such as excavation or trenching. Erosion control Best
       Management Practices will be used to mitigate stormwater runoff from
       entering the State waters.

       discharges of pollutants, including storm water runoff (e.g., construction
       dewatering effluent) will be required pursuant to HAR Title 11, Chapter 55,
       “Water Pollution Control.” The NPDES General Permit coverage for
       discharges to State waters (HAR §11-55, Appendices B through L) expired at
       midnight on October 21, 2012 and DOH is currently going through the rule
       change process to re-adopt these NPDES General Permits. Activities and
       discharges that require NPDES permit coverage during the rule change
       process are required to apply for the NPDES Individual Permit, which must be
       submitted at least 180 calendar days before the commencement of the
       discharge. Consultation with DOH will occur prior to the submittal of the
       appropriate NPDES Permit application (i.e., General or Individual).

       The long-term impact of the new facility and parking lot on Parcel 282 is the
       creation of more impermeable surface area. Completion of the new two-story
       facility and parking lot will likely improve surface runoff conditions due to the
       installation of proper drainage features and swales.

3.5.   Hazardous Materials and Solid Waste
The terms and conditions of GL-5400, which are applicable to Parcel 279, restrict
WHC from allowing the escape, disposal or release of any hazardous materials
except as permitted by law. WHC may not store or use such materials in an unlawful
manner and must seek consent from DLNR prior to bringing hazardous materials
onto the premises. The right-of-entry permit PSF No. 12OD-087 for Parcel 282
includes the same terms and conditions with respect to hazardous materials.

The surface soils on Parcel 282 were sampled and analyzed for the following
potential contaminants in accordance with DOH environmental action levels (EALs):
Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH-D and TPH-O), Polynuclear Aromatic Hyrdocarbons
(PAHs), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Organochlorine Pesticides and Total
Metals (refer to Appendix A). “With the exception of TPH-O, analytical data indicated
that TPH-D, PAHs, PCBs, pesticides, and total metals in the existing surface soils
were either not detected above method detection limits and/or below their
corresponding DOH EALs” (EnviroServices and Training Center, LLC, 2013). The
findings of the initial screening report indicate that Parcel 282 has not been
significantly impacted by the identified contaminants except for TPH-O. Gross
contamination concerns are described as nuisance concerns (e.g., odors,
aesthetics, etc.). The detected levels of TPH-O are not considered to be significant
concerns for Parcel 282 and did not exceed DOH EALs that pertain to the current
parking lot use.

Solid waste generated by WHC is currently collected twice a week by Honolulu
Disposal Service.




November 2013                                                                           3-7
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility




       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       The concentrations of TPH-O in the soils at Parcel 282 are not anticipated to
       be a significant concern. Additional management practices may be
       implemented as warranted in response to development and construction
       activities. WHC is expected to coordinate proposed activities including the
       demolition of select facilities on Parcel 279 and construction of the new facility
       on Parcel 282 with DLNR to ensure that hazardous materials do not
       jeopardize public health and environmental safety. WHC is expected to abide
       by the terms and conditions of its lease and right-of-entry permit.

       Demolition and construction activities are expected to temporarily increase
       the volume of solid waste including construction debris that is generated by
       WHC; however, the long-term activities on Parcel 279 and 282 may generate
       a small increase in solid waste over current levels. Domestic solid waste
       would continue to be collected by a private contractor and no adverse impacts
       are anticipated.

3.6.   Natural Hazards
Natural hazards that pose potential island wide effects are floods, tsunami
inundation, tropical cyclones and earthquakes. In general, the exposure to natural
hazards from unpredictable events is no greater at Parcels 279 and 282 than other
locations on Oʻahu. Rockfalls and wildfires on Oʻahu that have caused loss of life or
damage to property were localized hazards. Many wildfires are caused by human
actions of an intentional nature or as a result of negligence.

Parcels 279 and 282 fall within Zone X according to the Flood Insurance Rate Map
Panel No. 15003C 0380G for Hawaiʻi (effective date January 19, 2011) prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Zone X designation refers to
inundation areas of low-to-moderate risk that are outside the 0.2 percent annual
chance (or 500-year) floods. Flood zone designations are shown in Figure 4.

Tsunami evacuation zone maps for the State of Hawaiʻi identify low lying areas
where excavation is recommended since extensive damage to life and property may
occur from seismic sea waves. The City and County of Honolulu Department of
Emergency Management updated the tsunami evacuation zone maps in 2010 by
taking tsunami inundation data and incorporating a public safety buffer that provides
better zone recognition. Parcels 279 and 282 are outside the tsunami evacuation
zone (Hawaiʻi State Civil Defense, n.d.).




November 2013                                                                           3-8

Draft EA                              Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



Many tropical cyclones have passed close enough to affect the State of Hawaiʻi
since the recording of such events began in the 1950s. Hurricane Iwa in 1982 and
Hurricane Iniki in 1992 both brought destructive winds and torrential rains that
resulted in significant property damage. Hurricane Iniki was connected to six deaths.

The most recent earthquakes to have statewide impacts occurred on October 15,
2006. The earthquakes, which occurred off the Kona coast of Hawaiʻi, had
magnitudes of 6.7 and 6.0. The event caused property damage and triggered an
island-wide electrical blackout on Oʻahu.

There are no apparent rockfall hazards in the vicinity of Parcels 279 and 282, which
consist of relatively flat terrain that is far from steep cliffs and slopes. Threats from
wildfires are unlikely but possible since there is abundant vegetation along the
northern boundary of Parcel 279 and along the northern and eastern boundaries of
Parcel 282. Drought conditions and high winds could exacerbate the fire hazard.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       The proposed project would not significantly increase the risks to human
       health or property. The threats to humans and property from unpredictable
       natural events such as floods, tsunami inundation, tropical cyclones and
       earthquakes will always be present. The likelihood of a fire originating in the
       overgrown vegetation on Parcel 282 would be reduced since the area would
       be cleared for the parking lot. WHC is expected to have an evacuation plan
       that addresses the safety of staff and visitors in the event of man-made and
       natural disasters. Parcels 279 and 282 are near Waimānalo Fire Station and
       within walking distance of Waimānalo Elementary and Intermediate School,
       which is a designated hurricane evacuation shelter that can accommodate
       persons with special health needs and caged household pets.

3.7.   Floral and Faunal Resources
The following excerpt is from the Final Watershed Plan and Environmental Impact
Statement for the Waimanalo Watershed, City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii (U.S.
Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service, 1981). “An interagency survey
determined that the fish and wildlife habitat in the area is not unique, and the species
observed, other than endangered birds, are common introduced species. There is
no critical habitat for the endangered species within the watershed.”

Parcels 279 and 282 are within a larger geographic area that has experienced a long
history of significant land-disturbing activities including large-scale agriculture,
livestock and ranching activities that altered the natural environment. The U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service in its letter dated September 25, 2013 indicated that it reviewed
pertinent information in its files (including data compiled by the Hawaiʻi Biodiversity




November 2013                                                                           3-11
Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



and Mapping Program) and concluded that no federally designated or proposed
critical habitat occurs within the proposed project footprint.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       No species listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or in the Endangered
       Species Act are expected to be affected by demolition activities on Parcel 279
       and construction of the new health care facility on Parcel 282. Project actions
       include the necessary removal of overgrown vegetation consisting of
       introduced, non-native floral species on Parcel 282 that currently provides the
       visual effect of green space. The proposed project includes new landscaping
       with trees and native plants that are adapted to the local environment.

3.8.   Archaeological and Cultural Resources
Parcels 279 and 282 are not listed on the State or National Register of Historic
Places and are part of the geographic area that has experienced a long history of
significant land disturbance from large-scale agriculture, livestock and ranching
activities. Both parcels are adjacent to military lands that were in use from 1917.
Parcels 279 and 282 are also near Bellows Field Archaeological Area (State Site
Number 80-15-0511), which is formally listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. The Bellows Field complex contains a very early habitation and burial site
documented by the Bishop Museum as Site 018. “It is accepted that the Bellows
Field Archaeological Area was intended to primarily protect Site 018 and that the
boundary of Bellows Field Archaeological Area was arbitrarily drawn when the extent
of the archaeological resources were not known” (PBR Hawaii and Associates, Inc.,
2012). Parcels 279 and 282 are away from other Waimānalo properties on the State
and National Register of Historic Places:

           State Site Number     Site Name
           80-15-0382            Pohakunui Heiau

Consultation was sought from several agencies and organizations: the State Historic
Preservation Division (SHPD), Oʻahu Burial Council, Office of Hawaiian Affairs
(OHA), Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, Waimānalo Village Residents’
Corporation, Waimānalo Hawaiian Homes Association (WHHA), Native Hawaiian
Chamber of Commerce, and Onipaa Na Kupuna O Waimānalo. OHA indicated that it




November 2013                                                                         3-12
Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



is unaware of traditional and cultural practices at Parcel 282. WHHA expressed its
full support for the project and recommended five long-time residents as additional
contacts. WHC consulted twelve (12) community individuals, including four (4)
suggested by the WHHA, who were long-time residents of Waimānalo (40+ years).
Their collective knowledge suggests that Parcel 282 has not been utilized for
traditional and cultural practices within recent times.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       There are no known archaeological and cultural resources that would be
       endangered by the demolition of select buildings on Parcel 279 and
       construction of a new facility on Parcel 282. Unanticipated discoveries of
       archaeological and cultural resources may occur during the various phases of
       construction (e.g., excavation and trenching). The following terms and
       conditions pertaining to subsurface resources are stated in the right-of-entry
       permit for Parcel 282 (PSF No. 12OD-087): “In the event any unanticipated
       sites or remains such as bone or charcoal deposits, human burials, rock or
       coral alignments, pavings or walls are encountered the WHC shall stop work
       and contact the SHPD in Kapolei at (808) 692-8015 immediately.”

       The available knowledge suggests that the exercise of native Hawaiian rights
       or any ethnic group related to gathering, access or other customary activities
       will not be impacted by construction of a new facility on Parcel 282.

3.9.   Visual Resources
Waimānalo is a rural community that is characterized by residential communities,
small businesses and agricultural lots interspersed with green space. Mature canopy
trees help to soften the effect of low-density buildings and structures. The existing
WHC facilities on Parcel 279 contribute to a line of adjacent building elements along
the makai portion of Kalanianaʻole Highway. Vegetation on the eastern portion of
Parcel 282 provides the visual element of green space.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       The proposed project will not significantly alter the visual character of the
       Waimānalo area. The new health care facility will not exceed the 25-foot
       building height limitations. The vegetated area of Parcel 282 will be
       necessarily cleared for a parking lot; however, the proposed project will
       include landscaping with trees and other plants that grow naturally and are
       appropriate to the climate of Waimānalo. Landscaping is expected to include
       a small garden area. The demolition of select buildings on Parcel 279 will
       return more of the site to open space.




November 2013                                                                         3-13
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



3.10. Noise
The project site is located in a rural community where the primary noise source is
related to vehicular traffic along Kalanianaʻole Highway. There are low traffic
volumes on this main arterial through Waimānalo except during peak travel periods
in the morning and late afternoon. Siren noise generated by the Waimānalo Fire
Station also contributes to the background noise environment. In general, there is
low background noise in the vicinity of Parcels 279 and 282.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       Audible noise from demolition and construction activities is expected to be
       intermittent and unavoidable. The mitigation of noisy activities to inaudible
       levels will not be practical in all cases due to the intensity and exterior nature
       of the work. Ambient noise levels in the vicinity of Parcels 279 and 282 will
       increase due to the movement of construction vehicles and heavy equipment.
       Quieter construction activities, such as building erection and equipment
       installation, may not be audible. Construction noise is temporary in nature and
       will cease upon completion of the project.

       Project activities shall comply with the provisions of HAR Title 11, Chapter 46,
       “Community Noise Control.” The noise regulations require a noise permit if
       the noise level from construction activity is expected to exceed allowable
       levels stated in the Chapter 11-46 rules. It shall be the contractor’s
       responsibility to minimize noise by properly maintaining noise mufflers and
       other noise-attenuating equipment and to maintain noise levels within
       regulatory limits. If construction activities occur outside of the allowable
       timeframes designated for the noise permit (i.e., nighttime, Sunday, holiday)
       and exceed allowable noise levels, a noise variance must be obtained prior to
       commencement of construction activities, as required.

       Potential noise impacts will also be mitigated by performing the majority of
       construction work during daytime hours (as opposed to night work). Daytime
       work will ensure minimal impacts to existing users adjacent to and in the
       vicinity of the project site, including reducing the inconvenience of
       construction noise impacts during nighttime hours.

       The new health care facility on Parcel 282 is not expected to be a significant
       source of background noise. The backup generator is expected to be isolated
       in an appropriate manner that avoids or minimizes significant noise.




November 2013                                                                          3-14
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



3.11. Circulation and Traffic
Vehicular access to Parcels 279 and 282 is via driveways along Kalanianaʻole
Highway (State Route 72), which is the primary arterial route connecting Waimānalo
to Kailua and to Makapuʻu. The section of highway in front of Parcels 279 and 282 is
two lanes wide with limited shoulder space. The posted speed limit is 25 miles per
hour in the vicinity of Parcels 279 and 282.

The City and County of Honolulu provides bus services to the Waimānalo area via
Kalanianaʻole Highway. Routes 57, 77 and 89 provide service from Kailua to
Waimānalo to Sea Life Park, from Waimānalo to Kailua, and from Waimānalo to
downtown Honolulu, respectively. There are four bus stops in each direction along
the east and west bound lanes of Kalanianaʻole Highway between Poalima Street
and Inoaole Street.

The traffic impact assessment report (TIAR), which is found in Appendix B, included
a review of Waimānalo Neighborhood Board No. 32 meeting minutes from 2008
through 2013 and the study of nearby intersections. The community has expressed
concerns with respect to vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic in the surrounding
area. There is poor level-of-service during peak traffic periods at the intersections of
Kalanianaʻole Highway with Poalima Street, Moole Street and Inoaole Street. Future
background traffic volume increases that may warrant traffic signals at the Moole
Street and Inoaole Street intersections are not related to the proposed WHC project.
A separate left-turn lane for the northbound and southbound approaches of the
Moole Street intersection would allow for an improvement over poor level-of-service
conditions that already exist. The TIAR also noted that “the community has preferred
to retain a rural feel along Kalanianaʻole Highway and not include additional turn
lanes or traffic signals” (SSFM International, 2013).

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       Disruptions to vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic during the various
       phases of construction will be intermittent and temporary in nature.
       Appropriate traffic control devices and warning signs will be installed and the
       traffic flow will be directed by construction personnel or by law enforcement
       personnel, when necessary. No traffic lane closures or traffic detours are
       expected in conjunction with the construction activities; however, a State-
       approved traffic control plan shall be prepared prior to the construction of the
       proposed project if lane closures or traffic detours are deemed necessary.
       The bus routes, bus stops, and paratransit operations are not expected to be
       impacted by demolition or construction activities within Parcels 279 and 282.
       Coordination with the City and County of Honolulu, Department of
       Transportation Services (DTS) and Oahu Transit Services, Inc. (OTS) will be
       accomplished as necessary to ensure minimal inconvenience to motorists




November 2013                                                                          3-15
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



       and public transportation service. The contractor would be responsible for
       notifying the necessary DTS and OTS personnel of pertinent project details
       (such as the construction schedule) at least two weeks prior to the
       commencement construction activities.

       The majority of construction work will be scheduled during daytime hours (as
       opposed to night work) when traffic volumes are generally low within the
       residential neighborhoods nearest to the project site. At night and when work
       is not occurring, all associated construction equipment will be secured and
       located within Parcels 279 and 282 to prevent obstructions to traffic.

       It will be determined during the design phase whether the operation or
       transportation of any oversized and/or overweight vehicles and loads will be
       required during construction of the new health care facility. If required, these
       activities will be coordinated with all applicable Federal, State, and County
       agencies and all necessary permits/approvals will be acquired.

       Appropriate setbacks and sight distances will be incorporated into the project
       design. The new driveway for Parcel 282, which will be further east and
       farther away from the Waimānalo Fire Station driveway, must be approved by
       the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation (DOT). Coordination and
       consultation with the DOT Highways Division Traffic Review Branch is
       expected to be conducted by the project representative and/or the
       construction contractor as a requirement for acquiring the necessary project
       approvals and permits. The findings in the TIAR indicate that there would be a
       minimal change to the level-of-service at nearby intersections as a result of
       project-related traffic such that signals are not warranted at the driveways for
       Parcels 279 and 282. Coordination with the Waimānalo Fire Station is
       recommended to ensure that the existing flashing beacon on the makai side
       of Kalanianaʻole Highway is maintained or relocated and is visible to
       oncoming traffic.

3.12. Utilities (Water, Wastewater, Drainage)
Parcels 279 and 282 are located makai or seaward and down gradient from two
BWS potable water supply wells and four tunnels that feed the domestic water
supply system in Waimānalo, which also includes three reservoirs and one booster
station (Townscape, Inc., 2012). The project area is served by the Windward 272-
foot Water System, which is reportedly adequate to accommodate the domestic and
off-site fire protection requirements for the new health care facility. Potable water
service to Parcel 282 is available from an existing 12-inch water main along
Kalanianaʻole Highway. A final decision by BWS with regards to the availability of
water will be confirmed when the building permit application is submitted for
approval.




November 2013                                                                          3-16
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



The DOH Wastewater Branch indicates that the proposed action will occur in the
critical wastewater disposal area as determined by the Oʻahu Wastewater Advisory
Committee; however, domestic wastewater will be handled by the City’s sewer
system. The Waimānalo Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) currently services
the windward coast of Oʻahu from Makapuʻu to Waimānalo. Wastewater flows within
the vicinity of the project site are conveyed to the WWTP via a 15-inch diameter
vitrified clay pipe along Kalanianaʻole Highway. The DPP has conditionally approved
the sewer connection for Parcel 282.

There are currently no City, State or privately-owned drainage structures located
within or adjacent to Parcels 279 and 282. The City owns and maintains a municipal
stormwater drainage system within the surrounding City-owned streets but there are
no State-owned drainage structures along Kalanianaʻole Highway in the vicinity of
the project sites. Stormwater runoff from Parcel 282 generally sheet flows from the
site into the grassed area in front of the property along the roadway. Runoff then
continues within the grassed swale along the westbound lane of Kalanianaʻole
Highway and into the streambed at Inoaole Bridge.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       The new health care facility on Parcel 282 will require a new water service
       connection to the existing 12-inch water main along Kalanianaʻole Highway
       since it currently does not receive water service. The tie-in represents a
       negligible impact to the water system. The final decision on the availability of
       water will be confirmed when the building permit application is submitted for
       approval. The civil drawings will also be submitted to the Honolulu Fire
       Department for review and approval to ensure that on-site fire protection
       requirements are met.

       Parcel 282 will require a new lateral connection to the existing 15-inch sewer
       main along Kalanianaʻole Highway. The tie-in represents a negligible impact
       to the sewer system. The new sewer connection is subject to review and
       approval by DPP. An Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit (IWDP) may be
       required for the project. The contractor must notify the City’s Department of
       Environmental Services, Collection System Maintenance one week prior to
       the start of construction.

       A short-term and temporary impact of the project would occur from the
       generation of additional surface runoff during construction and demolition
       work. Appropriate erosion control BMPs will be used to minimize the amount
       of soil transported in stormwater runoff during construction activities. All
       construction activities will comply with applicable Federal, State and County
       regulations and rules for erosion control as previously discussed in Section
       3.4 Water Resources. Construction of the new facility and parking lot on

Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



       Parcel 282 will increase impervious areas, thereby increasing stormwater
       runoff. The anticipated impact will be offset by the installation of on-site
       drainage infiltration systems. The on-site drainage system will control excess
       sheet flow from the new parking lot. The proposed project will be designed to
       maintain the existing drainage patterns.

3.13. Power and Communications
Electrical power in the project area is provided by Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.
(HECO). There is a 25-foot HECO easement through Parcel 282. HECO requires
continued access to its easement for maintenance of its facilities. Hawaiʻi Gas
indicates that it has no facilities (e.g., gas lines) in the project area.

Telephone service in the project area is available from the Hawaiian Telephone
Company. Other communication services are provided by Oceanic Time Warner
Cable. The overhead communications lines are co-located on utility poles along
Kalanianaʻole Highway.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       Proposed construction and demolition work has the potential to disrupt power
       and communication systems but these effects are expected to be short-term
       and temporary. The new health care facility on Parcel 282 is not anticipated to
       consume substantial amounts of energy since it represents a continuation of
       existing functions on Parcel 279. Select buildings on Parcel 279 will be
       demolished after the relocation of services to a modern facility on Parcel 282
       that incorporates sustainable building design concepts and energy saving
       measures. There are no long-term impacts associated with establishing new
       service connections.

       The proposed project will be coordinated with HECO because there will be a
       realignment of the 25-foot easement through Parcel 282. The site design for
       the new facility accommodates HECO’s need for continued access to its
       easement. HECO indicates that it has no objections to the project and is
       therefore agreeable to relocation of the easement. It is anticipated that WHC
       would be responsible for the total cost of relocating the electrical easement
       within Parcel 282.

       Oceanic Time Warner Cable indicates that its trunking cables can be run on
       proposed utility poles on the makai side of Kalanianaʻole Highway. The
       establishment of communication services will be coordinated with the
       appropriate service provider.




November 2013                                                                         3-18

3.14. Socio-Economic Characteristics
The rural community of Waimānalo as roughly covered by the boundaries of the
Waimānalo Neighborhood Board No. 32 has a resident population of 11,141 persons
according to the 2012 State of Hawaiʻi Data Book (State of Hawaiʻi Department of
Business, Economic Development and Tourism, 2013). WHC indicates that its
community-based efforts focus on the large Native Hawaiian population of
Waimānalo, which includes 6,488 Waimānalo residents who are Native Hawaiian or
part-Hawaiian (Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 2011).

The State of Hawaiʻi Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) owns
approximately 2,000 acres in Waimānalo (Group 70, 2011). There are several DHHL
housing areas in the surrounding vicinity of Parcels 279 and 282.

WHC operates within the geographic area of Waimānalo, which has a HRSA
designation as a Medically Underserved Population and Health Professional
Shortage Area. Physicians and practitioners at WHC serve the uninsured, accept
MedQuest or Quest Expanded Access, and offer a sliding fee discount for services.
It is estimated that the WHC currently provides services to an average of 80 patients
per day. In 2012, 30 percent of WHC’s patients were uninsured and 66 percent are
at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. The WHC currently has 68
employees (39 for medical services and 28 for administration and programs).

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       The proposed project, which will increase the service capabilities of WHC, will
       not affect population levels or housing. The various phases of construction
       will create short-term jobs for people in design and construction. In the long-
       term, there will be approximately fourteen (14) additional health-related
       employment opportunities at the WHC.

3.15. Emergency Service Facilities and Shelters
Emergency service providers include law enforcement, fire departments and critical
care providers such as hospitals and clinics. Evacuation centers provide shelter in
the event of man-made or natural disasters.

Law enforcement is provided by the City and County of Honolulu, Honolulu Police
Department. The nearest police station relative to the project area is the Kāneʻohe
District Station in Kāneʻohe.

Fire protection services are provided by the Honolulu Fire Department. The
Waimānalo Fire Department is located directly adjacent to Parcel 282.




November 2013                                                                         3-19
Draft EA                              Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



WHC provides primary and preventive health care services. The nearest emergency
care facility relative to the project area is Castle Medical Center in Kailua.

The Waimānalo Elementary and Intermediate School located across Kalanianaʻole
Highway from Parcels 279 and 282 is a designated hurricane evacuation shelter. It
is noted that this shelter can accommodate persons with special health needs and
caged household pets.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       No significant adverse impacts to police, fire, medical, or emergency shelter
       services will occur from the completion of the new health care facility. The
       proposed project includes relocating the driveway for Parcel 282 further east
       and farther away from the driveway for the adjacent Waimānalo Fire Station.
       The new driveway for Parcel 282 will also be further east and away from the
       one-way exit for the Waimānalo Public Library and Waimānalo Elementary
       and Intermediate School across Kalanianaʻole Highway.

3.16. Recreational Resources
The recreational resources closest to Parcels 279 and 282 are Waimānalo District
Park, Bellows Field Beach Park, Waimānalo Bay Beach Park and Waimānalo Polo
Field. Other opportunities for shared-use facilities (e.g., a high school with a football
field, track or swimming pool) and non-profit recreation centers (e.g., a YMCA or
YWCA) are not present within the rural community of Waimānalo.

       Impacts and Mitigation Measures
       Project actions will have no adverse impact on recreational facilities.

4.3.   City and County of Honolulu General Plan
The General Plan of the City and County of Honolulu sets forth broad statements of
social, economic, environmental, and design objectives and policies which are
desired over the long-term. The excerpts below are General Plan policies and
objectives that pertain to the proposed project, which is an extension of the urban
development that already exists in Waimanalo along Kalanianaʻole Highway. The
new health care facility on Parcel 282 allows for the convenient delivery of needed
services to the surrounding community. The two-story facility is expected to be
designed with due consideration to the rural setting and character of Waimanalo.

       VII. Physical Development and Urban Design
           Objective A: To coordinate changes in the physical environment of Oahu
           to ensure that all new developments are timely, well-designed, and
           appropriate for the areas in which they will be located.
           Policy 5: Provide for more compact development and intensive use of
               urban lands where compatible with the physical and social character of
               existing communities.
           Policy 6: Encourage the clustering of developments to reduce the cost of
               providing utilities and other public services.
           Policy 8: Locate community facilities on sites that will be convenient to the
               people they are intended to serve.
           Objective D: To maintain those development characteristics in the urban-
           fringe and rural areas which make them desirable places to live.
           Policy 4: Maintain rural areas as areas which are intended to provide
               environments supportive of lifestyle choices which are dependent on
               the availability of land suitable for small to moderate size agricultural
               pursuits, a relatively open and scenic setting, and/or a small town,
               country atmosphere consisting of communities which are small in size,
               very low density and low rise in character, and may contain a mixture
               of uses.




November 2013                                                                           4-2
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



           Objective E: To create and maintain attractive, meaningful, and
           stimulating environments throughout Oahu.
           Policy 5: Require new developments in stable, established communities
               and rural areas to be compatible with the existing communities and
               areas.

       IX. Health and Education
           Objective A: To protect the health of the people of Oahu.
           Policy 1: Encourage the provisions of health-care facilities that are
              accessible to employment and residential centers.
           Policy 3: Coordinate City and County health codes and other regulations
              with State and Federal health codes to facilitate the enforcement of
              air-, water-,and noise-pollution controls.

4.4.   Koʻolau Poko Sustainable Communities Plan
The Island of Oʻahu is divided into eight Development Plan areas as required by a
1973 City Charter; the plans for six of these areas have been designated as
“Sustainable Communities Plans” to highlight the intent that these areas are not to
be heavily developed, and that existing communities and special qualities of each
region should be sustained and improved. Each Development Plan and Sustainable
Communities Plan implements the objectives and policies of the General Plan and
serves as a guide for public policy, investment, and decision making within each
respective region. Together with the General Plan, these documents guide
population and land use growth over a 20- to 25-year time span.

Parcels 279 and 282 are located within the region encompassed by the Koʻolau
Poko Sustainable Communities Plan, which establishes policies to shape the growth
and development of the Koʻolau Poko region. The plan was adopted in August 2000
and seeks to preserve Koʻolau Poko’s natural, scenic, cultural, historical and
agricultural resources, and to protect the residential environment of its
neighborhoods. The Plan calls for adaptation of the traditional ahupuaʻa concept as
a basis for land use and natural resources management. The public review draft of
the revised Plan is expected to be circulated for public review and comment in the
late fall or winter of 2013. The following excerpts are the vision, policies, principles
and guidelines that are applicable to the proposed project.

       VISION:
          Protect the community’s natural, scenic, cultural, historic and agricultural
          resources.
       THEMES:
         Maintain the predominantly low-rise, low-density, single family character of
         the urban fringe and rural communities.




November 2013                                                                           4-3
Draft EA                             Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility




       IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS:
          Koʻolau Poko consists of natural resource elements and man-made
          expressions. The tools we use to protect its rural character include:
          ahupuaʻa divisions, rural community boundaries, village centers and rural
          development standards.
       Chapter 3: Land Use Policies, Principles and Guidelines
       3.8 INSTITUTIONAL USES
       3.8.1. General Policies
       Existing institutions may expand facilities and programs within the campuses
       they presently occupy. However, because the major institutions are located
       adjacent to significant scenic resources, the campuses should retain an open
       space character and buildings and facilities on the campus should be sited
       and designed to respect the scenic context.
       3.8.2. Planning Principles
       Appropriate Scale and Architectural Style. The architectural character of
       institutional buildings and structures should respect the surrounding urban
       and natural features, particularly when located adjacent to a residential area
       or significant natural or historic feature.
       Environmental Compatibility. Encourage energy efficient features, such as the
       use of solar panels for heating water, and passive solar design, such as the
       use of window recesses and overhangs and orientation of openings to allow
       natural cross-ventilation.
       3.8.3. Guidelines
       Architectural Character and Building Massing. Building heights should not
       exceed two to three stories or 40 feet, including the roof form. Height setback
       transitions should be provided from street frontages, the shoreline, and
       adjacent residential areas.

4.5.   City and County of Honolulu Land Use Ordinance
The City and County of Honolulu Land Use Ordinance regulates land use in
accordance with adopted land use policies, including the City and County of
Honolulu General Plan and the Development/Sustainable Community Plans. The
zoning for Parcels 279 and 282 is R-5 Residential District. The DPP lists several
considerations pertaining to the R-5 zoning in its letter dated October 2, 2013:
          The expanded care facility is a “public use and structure” because the
           WHC provides general health care services to the community under
           agreements with the DOH to fulfill specific functions for the public good as
           authorized by State law;
          Public uses and structures are permitted in the R-5 Residential District.




November 2013                                                                           4-4
Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



          There are no specific parking requirements for a public use and structure;
           and
          Parking for a public use and structure will be determined by the DPP
           Director.

4.6.   State Coastal Zone Management Program
Hawaiʻi’s Coastal Zone Management (CZM) program, established pursuant to
Chapter 205A, HRS, as amended, is administered by the State of Hawaiʻi, Office of
Planning and provides for the beneficial use, protection, and development of the
State’s coastal zone. Through the CZM program and pursuant to the Hawaiʻi Coastal
Zone Management Act (Chapter 205A, HRS, as amended), all counties have
enacted ordinances establishing Special Management Areas (SMAs). Development
within the SMA, including most development proposed by the State, requires a SMA
permit from the appropriate County. On Oʻahu, the SMA permit is administered by
the DPP and acted upon by the City Council pursuant to Chapter 25, Revised
Ordinances of Honolulu.

Parcel 282 is located within the City’s SMA and requires approval of a SMA Use
Permit (Major). The first phase of the SMA permit application process is the
preparation and acceptance of an EA. This EA was prepared to concurrently
address the first phase of the SMA permit application process. It is anticipated that
the SMA Use Permit (Major) will be obtained during the design phase of the project.

5.     POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES
5.1.   No-Action
As a result of no action, no construction-related activities would occur on Parcel 282
and there would be no demolition of any trailers or buildings on Parcel 279. WHC
would not pursue a new 65-year lease for Parcels 279 and 282 and would instead
remain at its current campus on Parcel 279 and in its current configuration until
August 31, 2030 when its current lease expires. WHC employees would continue to
utilize Parcel 282 for parking according to the terms and conditions of the
management right-of-entry (PSF 12OD-087). The HECO easement could remain in
its current alignment as a result of no action.

No action implies that there would be no commitment of funding or capital
improvement costs for new construction. In the long term, the no action alternative
may still result in the need for funding and financial expenditures as existing older
buildings on Parcel 279 continue to age. Financial resources that are expended for
increased repair and maintenance costs would therefore be unavailable for health
care programs and services.

5.2.   Delayed Action (New Facility and Parking Lot)
Delaying the construction of the expanded health care facility would not significantly
alter the environmental consequences of the project unless a new site with different
characteristics becomes available for consideration. A delayed action is expected to
result in increased construction costs due to inflation, changes in economic
conditions, or the labor supply. Building materials and labor costs tend to increase
with time; therefore, a delayed action may require a greater funding commitment for
a two-story facility or a reduction in the scope and size of the facility.

On September 23, 2013, MCTAB notified community leaders and adjacent property
owners of an environmental due diligence survey for Parcel 5C, which is located
immediately north and adjacent to the WHC campus on Parcel 279 (refer to
Appendix C). Parcel 5C comprises approximately 1.5 acres of land that abuts the
neighboring residential subdivision along its western border. Several residential lots,
the WHC campus, and St. George Church abut Parcel 5C along its southern border.
Vehicular access to and egress from Parcel 5C appears to be non-existent or
extremely limited. The survey of the triangular-shaped parcel will provide a
background check for environmental hazards such as metallic items that may be
military munitions. MCTAB may eventually declare Parcel 5C as excess property
that could be transferred to a new property owner sometime in the future after the
survey results are known. At this time, the environmental conditions of Parcel 5C are
unknown and its transfer from military ownership is not assured.




November 2013                                                                          5-1
Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



5.3.   Parking Lot Only
This alternative is for a parking lot on Parcel 282 with no new health care facility.
The development of a permanent, at-grade parking lot on Parcel 282 would involve
short-term construction activities associated with grading, curbing and landscaping.
Utility connections for water service and wastewater disposal would not be needed.
On-site drainage infiltration systems would be implemented and a permanent
drainage system would be installed to control excess sheet flow from the new
parking lot. Vehicular access to and egress from Parcel 282 would be improved in
consideration of the HECO easement and impacts to circulation and traffic along
Kalanianaʻole Highway. The footprint of the permanent parking lot would comprise
the existing unpaved parking area on the western portion of Parcel 282. The
overgrown vegetation on the eastern portion of Parcel 282 would presumably remain
as green space. Portions of the improved parking lot would be landscaped.
Landscaping would consist of trees and plants that are appropriate to the climate of
Waimānalo. The landscaped area would include a small garden area that would be
utilized by the dietary services program. Other plants specified in the overall
landscaping may also be used for medicinal or nutritional purposes by the WHC.

The development of a permanent parking lot on Parcel 282 requires less funding as
compared to the option for new construction of a two-story facility with parking on
Parcel 282. There would be no demolition of trailers or buildings on Parcel 279 since
the WHC would continue to utilize its existing campus until such time that its lease
expires. In the long-term, the parking lot alternative may still result in the need for
future funding and financial expenditures as existing older buildings on Parcel 279
continue to age. Financial resources that are expended for increased repair and
maintenance costs would therefore be unavailable for health care programs and
services. The existing WHC facility on Parcel 279 would continue to be inadequately
sized and inefficiently configured.

5.4.   New Facility and Parking Lot (the Preferred Alternative)
The concept for the expanded health care facility on Parcel 282 balances existing
site constraints such as the HECO easement and traffic considerations with the
WHC’s goals for improving the delivery of much-needed health care services. The
proposed alternative incorporates the design concepts that are based on preliminary
discussions and coordination efforts.

The utility easement that currently transects Parcel 282 will be moved east and
slightly realigned to maximize the building footprint for the new facility while
providing HECO with full access to its easement for maintenance of its facilities. The
WHC continues to coordinate its proposed project with HECO, which stated in its
letter dated October 9, 2013 that it has no objections to the project as currently
proposed with the easement realignment.




November 2013                                                                          5-2
Draft EA                            Waimānalo Health Center – Expanded Health Care Facility



Traffic and circulation impacts from the new facility were evaluated in the TIAR.
There are known community concerns with respect to vehicular, bicycle and
pedestrian traffic in the surrounding vicinity of Parcels 279 and 282. The new
driveway for Parcel 282 will be further east from its current location due to several
geometric considerations. The current driveway is approximately 120 feet from the
main driveway to the Waimānalo Fire Station and about 50 feet away and across
from the one-way exit for the Waimānalo Elementary and Intermediate School and
Waimānalo Public Library. The option to keep the existing driveway for Parcel 282 in
its current location would have reduced the buildable area and frontage for the new
facility along Kalanianaʻole Highway due to the turning radius that is needed to allow
vehicles (including delivery trucks and paratransit vans) to simultaneously exit and
enter the site.

A new driveway toward the eastern end of Parcel 282 and near the intersection of
Kalanianaʻole Highway with Inoaole Street would have been problematic for two
main reasons. First, this option would have compromised the access and egress for
residents of the Hale Aupuni subdivision and those living in the complex behind the
Waimānalo Elementary and Intermediate School. Second, a new driveway at this
location would have required the permanent relocation of a bus stop that serves
Routes 57, 77 and 89.

A significant reduction or elimination of the parking component of the new health
care facility would have allowed more or all of the overgrown vegetation on the
eastern portion of Parcel 282 to remain as green space. It is projected that the
number of WHC employees and patrons would increase over time; therefore, the
reduction or elimination of available parking would cause WHC employees or
patrons to park their vehicles at off-site locations within Waimānalo when the parking
lot at Parcel 279 is full.

The site design for the new facility that includes a slight realignment of the utility
easement, a new driveway further east and farther away from other driveways, and
additional on-site parking was selected as the preferred alternative. Completion of
the new facility as currently designed and configured will allow WHC to house
medical, behavioral health, vision, pharmacy, nutrition, outreach and eligibility
services in a modern health care facility with properly configured and adequately
sized examination rooms and support areas. The two-story health care facility will
add to the line of development along Kalanianaʻole Highway; however, proposed
landscaping will include trees, plants and a small garden area. The demolition of
select buildings on Parcel 279 will return more of the site to open space. The
completed health care facility and successful award of a new 65-year lease for
Parcels 279 and 282 represents an extended commitment from WHC to provide
primary and preventive health care services in Waimānalo in fulfillment of its
mission.

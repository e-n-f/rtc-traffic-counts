Transportation Impact Analysis                                                            April 2010



                                 Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the Traffic Impact Study through a set of
frequently asked questions (FAQs).


Where is the project located?
The project site is located in the City of Walla Walla immediately east of Assumption Catholic
Church and school, and is also east of Hawk Drive and Berney Drive. Access to the proposed
project would be provided via and extension of both Wallace Street and Alder Street.


What is the project land use and trip generation?
The project includes the construction of 201 single-family detached housing units and would
generate an average of 1,924 weekday trips with 151 trips occuring during the weekday AM
peak hour and 203 trips occuring during the PM peak hour.


What are the existing and future without-project conditions in
the study area?
All intersections and minor street approaches operate at LOS C or better during AM and PM
peak hour periods under both existing and 2015 without-project conditions, and meet the City
of Walla Walla's LOS standards. Under 2025 conditions, all intersections would continue to
operate at LOS C or better, except the Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection
which would operate at LOS E.


Would the project have any traffic impacts?
With the addition of project generated traffic, minor street delays at the intersection of Alder
Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road would increase by more than 10-seconds under 2015
conditions. Under 2025 conditions the LOS E at the intersection would fall to LOS F with the
addition of project traffic. All other study intersections would operate at LOS C or better
during AM and PM peak hour periods and would continue to meet the City of Walla Walla's
LOS standards.


What mitigation measures are recommended?
Based on anticipated operating conditions, mitigation would be required to meet City
standards under without or with-project conditions at the Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball
Road intersection. Several improvement alternatives were analyzed including constructing
additional lanes, constructing a roundabout, closing Timball Road and realigning the
intersection, constructing a traffic signal, and modifying the access configuration to the site.
None of these alternatives would improve operations to conform to City standards and
guidelines. Based on coordination with City staff, a proportionate share contribution of
$42,600 towards the City's identified long-range improvement at this intersection would
mitigate project related impacts.

Transportation Impact Analysis                                                         April 2010



                                   Introduction
This report summarizes the results of the traffic impact analysis (TIA) prepared for the
proposed Provenance Residential project located in Walla Walla, Washington. The purpose
of the analysis was to identify potential transportation related impacts associated with the
proposed project and, where necessary, identify measures to mitigate project impacts. This
analysis follows the requirements set forth in the Walla Walla Urban Area Traffic Impact
Analysis (TIA) Guidelines and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).


Project Description
The proposed project is located in the City of Walla Walla and includes the construction of
201 single-family detached housing units. The project site is located immediately east of
Assumption Catholic Church and school, and is also east of Hawk Drive and Berney Drive as
shown in Figure 1. The site is currently undeveloped. Access to the proposed project would
be provided via and extension of both Wallace Street and Alder Street. The project is
anticipated to be constructed and occupied by the end of 2015. A preliminary site plan is
shown in Figure 2.


Study Area & Scope
The study area was defined through coordination with City of Walla Walla staff and includes
of six intersections. The six off-site study intersections are listed below.

         Alder Street/Berney Drive
         Alder Strett/Tausick Way-Timball Road
         Parish Street/Tausick Way
         Wallace Street/Berney Drive
         Parish Street/Assumption Drive

The analysis focuses on the traffic operations at these six study intersections during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours. Future operations were analyzed for 2015, the anticipated
year of build-out, and 2025 conditions at the request of City staff. This long-range horizon
year was analyzed for informational purposes and is useful to the City in determining and/or
confirming the future adequacy of existing transportation facilities and planned transportation
improvements in the study area.

                                 Existing Conditions
The following sections describe existing conditions in the study area including the
surrounding roadway network and traffic control, AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes,
collision history within the project vicinity, and intersection operations. This section also
summarizes existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and transit service in the vicinity of the
project site.


Roadway Network & Traffic Control
The primary roadways within the site vicinity are described below.

E Alder Street is an east-west two-lane roadway classified as a prinicipal arterial and has a
posted speed limit of 30 mph within the project vicinity. Sidewalks and dedicated bike lanes
are provided along both sides of the roadway within the study area.

Tausick Way is a two-lane principal arterial within the project vicinity. The roadway generally
travels from southwest to northeast and has a posted speed limit of 30 mph but increases to
35 mph north of Garrison Street. Sidewalks, dedicated bike lanes, and parallel parking are
provided along both sides of the roadway.

The remaining streets within the study area, including Assumption Drive, Berney Drive,
Garrison Street, Parish Street, Timball Road, and Wallace Street are two-lane local
access streets. Intermittent sidewalks are provided. Parallel parking is generally allowed. No
dedicated bike facilites are provided along these roadways. Trimball

Existing channelization and traffic control at each study intersection along study area
roadways is shown in Figure 3.


Traffic Volumes
Traffic volume data were collected for each study area intersection and the site access
driveway to characterize weekday traffic conditions during the AM and PM peak hour periods.
Traffic volumes were collected in April 2010. Detailed volume data is provided in Appendix A
and existing weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 4.

Collision History
Collision records for the five most recent complete calendar years (2004-2008) were
reviewed within the study area to identify any existing traffic safety issues. Data for the
complete 2009 calendar year is not yet available. A summary of the total and average annual
number of reported collisions at each study intersection is provided in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, all study intersections have experienced an average of less than one
collision per year over the last five years.


Traffic Operations
Existing traffic operations were evaluated by calculating levels of service at each study
intersection. The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating
the intersection level of service (LOS). LOS for intersection operations is described
alphabetically (A through F). LOS is based on the calculated average control delay per
vehicle and is typically reported for the whole intersection for signalized and all-way stop-
controlled intersections, and by movement for two-way stop-controlled intersections. Control
delay is defined as the combination of initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time,
stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Appendix B provides a more detailed explanation
of LOS.

Existing peak hour levels of service were calculated at study intersections based on
methodologies contained in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM, Transportation Research
Board, 2000). Synchro 7.0 (Build 773) was used for the calculations. Results are summarized
in Table 2 and detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analysis are included in
Appendix C.

The Alder Street/Tausic Way-Timball Road intersection is configured such that the west leg
and southbound right-turning movement of the intersection are free-flowing. The south and
east legs, and the southbound left-turn lane are stop-controlled. Therefore it is not possible to
analyze this intersection using standard HCM methodologies. At two-way stop controlled
intersections the HCM methodologies only apply where the stop-controlled approaches are
opposite one another (i.e. north-south or east-west). To provide an approximate estimate of
operations on the stop-controlled approaches using the HCM methodology, the turning
movements at the Alder Street/Tausic Way-Timball Road intersection were rearranged and/or
combined so that an analysis could be performed.

Transit Service
Valley Transit provides bus service within the City of Walla Walla and operates nine fixed
routes throughout the city. Routes generally operate from approximately 6:15 AM and
6:00 PM. Seven of the nine routes operate with 30-minute headways between busses while
the remaining two routes operate with 60-minute headways. One of the fixed bus routes,
Route 1 operates within the study area.

Route 1 (Mainline) provides service between Walla Walla Community College, the downtown
transfer center, and the Wal-Mart in College Place. Buses serving Route 1 arrive 30-minutes
after one another and operate from 6:15 AM until 5:45 PM.


Pedestrian & Bicycle Facilities
Concrete sidewalks and dedicated bike lanes are provided along both sides of Alder Street
west of Tausick Way, and on Tausick Way north of Alder Street within the immediate vicinity
of the project site. Intermittent sidewalks are provided along the remaining roadways in the
study area, but no dedicated bike facilities are provided.

Transportation Impact Analysis                                                        April 2010



                Future Without-Project Conditions
This section documents future without-project conditions. The proposed project is anticipated
to be built-out by the end 2015. Thus, 2015 was chosen as the horizon year. In addition, City
staff directed that a long-term horizon year of 2025 also be analyzed. This later horizon year
is useful to the City in confirming the future adequacy of existing facilities and planned
transportation improvements in the study area. The analysis of future without-project
conditions provides the baseline against which the impacts of the proposed project were
evaluated.


Planned Improvements
The Walla Walla Six-Year Comprehensive Transportation Program Amended year 2009 for
2010-2015 was reviewed to determine if any roadway improvement projects are anticipated
to be built in the study area before completion of the proposed project in 2015. Although
improvements were identified for Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection,
specific improvements and funding are not yet identified. Therefore the roadway network was
assumed to remain unchanged from existing conditions.


Traffic Volumes
An annual growth rate of 1.5-percent was provided by City staff and applied to existing (2010)
traffic counts in order to estimate future (2015) background traffic volumes at study area
intersections and site access driveway. No other development projects are planned for
construction and occupancy before 2015, and thus no additional pipeline project trips were
added to background traffic. In addition, the specific future developments to be completed
beyond the 2015 horizon year are unknown at this time. For the 2025 long-range horizon
year, existing traffic volumes are also grown at the same 1.5-percent growth rate.

Future (2015) without-project AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5
and future (2025) without-project volumes are shown in Figure 6.


Traffic Operations
Levels of service (LOS) were calculated at the study intersections for future (2015 and 2025)
without-project conditions. Table 3 (page 14) summarizes the results of the analysis. The
LOS worksheets for future without-project conditions are included in Appendix C.

1.   Level of Service (A ­ F) as defined by the Highway Capacity Manual (TRB, 2000)
2.   Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3.   Intersection approach movement; NB is northbound.
4.   LOS D standard for all critical movements at stop-controlled intersections on arterial and collector roadways. LOS E for all local
     streets.


As shown in Table 3, all intersections and minor street approaches would continue to operate
at an acceptable level-of-service under future without-project conditions, except for Alder
Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road under 2025 conditions. The minor street approaches at this
intersection would fall to LOS E under 2025 AM peak hour conditions. All other study
intersections would continue to meet the City of Walla Walla's standards.


Transit Service
Transit ridership is expected to increase in the future as a result of general increases in
ridership demand. However, existing transit service within the area is anticipated to
accommodate anticipated growth.


Pedestrians & Bicycles
Pedestrian and bicycle traffic within the study area is expected to increase in the future as a
result of general increases in population. No pedestrian or bicycle facilites are planned to be
constructed in the study area within the horizon year. Existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities
are anticipated to accommodate anticipated growth.

                         Future With-Project Conditions
This section documents the site-generated impacts of the proposed project on the
surrounding roadway network, including impacts to traffic volumes, intersection operations,
traffic safety, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Project-generated peak hour traffic
volumes were estimated, distributed, and assigned to the surrounding roadway network.
Future with-project traffic volumes were projected and peak hour intersection operations were
evaluated. Future (2015) without-project and with-project conditions were compared in order
to identify impacts resulting from traffic generated by the proposed project. The long-range
horizon year (2025) was also analyzed under with-project conditions.


Project Trip Generation
Project traffic impacts were estimated based on estimated project trip generation. Vehicular
trip rates were based on information from the ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition (2008) for the
Single-Family Detached Housing (#210) land use. Table 4 summarizes the estimate trip
generation for the proposed project.

As shown in Table 4, the proposed project would generate an average of 1,924 weekday trips
with 151 trips occuring durring the weekday AM peak hour and 203 trips occuring during the
weekday PM peak hour.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
Project traffic is anticipated to distribute to the surrounding local and regional street network
according to the percentages depicted in Figure 7. Trip distribution patterns for the project
were based on existing peak hour traffic counts and land use data provided in the City's
Comprehensive Plan, and has been approved in coordination with City staff.

The anticipated project trip distribution was used to assign new peak hour project trips to the
surrounding network. These project trips are also shown in Figure 7. Site-generated peak
hour traffic volumes were then added to future (2015 and 2025) without-project traffic
volumes at study intersections. The resulting with-project peak hour traffic volumes for 2015
and 2025 are illustrated in Figure 8 and Figure 9, respectively.

Traffic Operations Impacts
Future with-project PM peak hour levels of service were calculated for the study intersections.
These calculations evaluate future with-project intersection operations based on the trip
generation characteristics of the proposed project.

The intersection geometries used in the analysis of future without-project conditions were
also used to analyze future with-project conditions. For comparison purposes, the calculated
peak hour intersection operations for future without-project conditions are shown with future
with-project conditions. Results for the 2015 horizon year are shown in Table 5 and results for
2025 are shown in Table 6. LOS worksheets for the analysis of with-project conditions are
included in Appendix C.

4.   LOS D standard for all critical movements at stop-controlled intersections on arterial and collector roadways. LOS E for all local
     streets.


With the exception of the Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection, as shown in
Table 5, under 2015 conditions all study intersections would continue to meet the City of
Walla Walla's LOS standards. Average delays at acceptable study intersections would
increase by less than 5 seconds. During the AM peak hour, minor street delay at the Alder
Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection increase by 17.7 seconds.

Under 2025 condions (Table 6), all intersections would continue to operate acceptably at
LOS D and better without or with the addition project traffic, except for the intersection of
Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road. This intersection would operate at LOS F with the
addition of project traffic.

As identified in the City's TIA Guidelines, mitigation is required if a project increases
intersection delay by more than 10.0-seconds when LOS standards are met, and when any
study intersection operates below the LOS standard. Based on these criteria, mitigation
would be required at the Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection, and is further
discussed in a later section.

Safety
Traffic generated by the proposed project would likely result in a proportionate increase in the
probability of collisions. However, historical collision rates are low and it is not anticipated that
the addition of project traffic would create a safety hazard or significantly increase the number
of reported collisions.


Transit Service
Some increase in transit ridership would likely occur as a result of the proposed project, but is
expected the be small. Existing transit service within the area is anticipated to accommodate
anticipated any increase in ridership.


Pedestrians & Bicycles
Pedestrian and bicycle traffic within the study area is expected to increase in the future as a
result of the proposed project. Existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities are able to
accommodate any growth.

                                       Mitigation
As previously presented, the proposed development is expected to result in a proportional
increase to traffic volumes within the study area. Intersections would continue to meet City
standards with minimal increases in delays with the exception of the Alder Street/Tausick
Way-Timball Road intersection. Several improvement alternatives were evaluated at this
intersection to determine an appropriate measure to mitigate project impacts.

         Channelization Improvements ­ Additional turn lanes and channelization, such as
         a two-way center turn-lane from the west leg (Alder Street) to the north leg (Tausick
         Way), could improve intersection operations to an acceptable LOS. However,
         geometric constraints along the existing roadways prohibit this improvement.

         Roundabout ­ Installing a roundabout would improve operations to meet City LOS
         standards, but would not fit within the existing public right-of-way. The acquisition of
         additional right-of-way is not feasible at this location.

         Close Timball Road & Realign the Intersection ­ Constructing this improvement
         would not improve operations enough to mitigate project impacts or address the LOS
         deficiency under 2025 conditions.

         Traffic Signal ­ Installing a traffic signal at the intersection would mitigate project
         impacts and improve operations to meet the LOS standards. However, City
         standards direct that signal warrants1 must be met to adequately justify installing a
         traffic signal. Based on the traffic volumes at the intersection throughout a full 24-
         hour period, signal warrants would not be met. This is evidenced by good operations
         at the intersection throughout the day except for the AM peak period as previously
         shown.

         Alternative Site Access Configuration ­ Alternative access locations to the site
         were considered to determine if enough project trips would be diverted to avoid the
         need for mitigation at the intersection. The current site plan identifies access via
         extensions of Alder Street and Wallace Street. Given the configuration of the
         roadway network in the project vicinity, the Alder Street access could be relocated to
         the north to connect to Hawk Drive approximately mid-way between Merrill Road and
         Greenwood Lane. However, as shown in the project trip distribution (Figure 7, p16)
         the majority of project trips are anticipated to travel to/from downtown Walla Walla.
         With access onto Hawk Drive, nearly all of these trips would likely travel south on
         Hawk Drive to Merill Road and then Alder Street and would not be diverted from the
         Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection. Little benefit to operations would
         be gained from this access configuration.

Based on this analysis, none of the alternatives mitigate project impacts. The City of Walla
Walla has identified the need for a long-range improvement at the Alder Street/Tausick Way-
Timball Road intersection in their Six-Year Comprehensive Transportation Program (2010-
2015). Based on coordination with City staff, project impacts can be mitigated by contributing
a proportionate share of the City's projected project cost based on 2015 AM peak hour traffic
volumes at the intersection since the need for mitigation occurs under AM hour conditions.
Under 2015 weekday AM peak hour conditions, project traffic contributes 14.2-percent (111
of 781 total vehicles) of traffic at the Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection.
Based on a projected cost to the City of $300,000 for improvements at the intersection,
project impacts would be mitigated by a proportionate share contribution of $42,600.

                               Summary & Conclusions
             The proposed project is located in the City of Walla Walla and includes the
             construction of 201 single-family detached housing units. The project would be built-
             out by the end of 2015.

             The project site is located immediately east of Assumption Catholic Church and
             school, and is also east of Hawk Drive and Berney Drive. Access to the proposed
             project would be provided via an extension of both Wallace Street and Alder Street.

             The proposed project would generate an average of 1,924 weekday trips with 151
             trips occuring durring the weekday AM peak hour and 203 trips occuring during the
             PM peak hour.

             All study intersections would meet the City of Walla Walla's operational standards
             during the AM and PM peak hour periods with the addition of project generated
             traffic, except for the Alder Street/Tausick Way-Timball Road intersection.

             Based on anticipated operating conditions, mitigation would be required to meet City
             standards under without or with-project conditions at the Alder Street/Tausick Way-
             Timball Road intersection. Several improvement alternatives were analyzed but none
             would improve operations to conform to City standards and guidelines. Based on
             coordination with City staff, a proportionate share contribution of $42,600 towards the
             City's identified long-range improvement at this intersection would mitigate project
             related impacts.


Additional access via Grapevine Place connected thru to an extension of
Garrison Street could redirect 25-30% of the trips to Tausick Way and
Garrison intersection. While the trips would still be utilizing the

Appendix B:   LOS Definitions
                                          Highway Capacity Manual, 2000

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

        B                     >10 - 20                Stable Flow (slight delays)
        C                     >20 - 35                Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                             Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait through
                              >35 - 55
                                                      more than one signal cycle before proceeding)
        E                     >55 - 80                Unstable flow (intolerable delay)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

Varsity Facility Services, a national firm, is low bidder. The selection committee interviewed Varsity to determine if they had the
experience and service quality the City is requiring. They have 56 years of experience serving clients such as Century Link, JP
Morgan Chase, Key Bank, and State of Washington Department of Ecology. The selection team, made up of representatives
from all departments who are housed in the above mentioned City facilities, recommended to select Varsity unanimously.
Reference checks were all positive. All employees will be required to pass background checks conducted by the City of Walla
Walla.

Currently MBG provides janitorial services to all of the buildings except the Police Department and ABM services the Police
Department.

FINANCIAL IMPACTS:
Budget allocation for janitorial services in the 2013 operating budget is $84,780.  This contract will save the City more than
$15,000 than the second lowest bidder as well as be under the budget allocation. 

ALTERNATIVES:
The Council could choose to award the bid to another bidder or direct staff to go back out to bid a second time.

STAFF RECOMMENDATION:
Staff recommends the City Council authorize the City Manager to enter into a contract for janitorial services with Varsity Facility
Services. 

CITY MANAGER'S COMMENTS:
Approved for City Council action.

ITEM TITLE:
Resolution Approving Tourism Promotion Area Business Plan for April - December 2013

HISTORY/POLICY ISSUES:
On August 11, 2004 the City Council adopted the Tourism Assessment and Strategic Plan as prepared by Tourism
Development Associates and recommended by the City's Tourism Commission. That plan includes the goal of creating a locally
based Walla Walla Valley tourism organization and identifies Tourism Promotion Area (TPA) revenue as an additional resource
for tourism promotion.

On October 25, 2004 the State of Washington certified Tourism Walla Walla as a non-profit organization with the following
purpose:
The mission of Tourism Walla Walla shall be to promote and support the continuing economic growth and quality of life of the
Walla Walla Valley through the development and execution of well-planned leisure and business travel sales and marketing
strategies, to promote the development of tourism products necessary to promote the growth of tourism to the Walla Walla
Valley, and to provide the necessary services to both visitors and group planners.

Since 2005 the City has contracted with Tourism Walla Walla to provide tourism promotion services utilizing Lodging Tax
Revenues collected in large part for that purpose.

On June 2, 2010 the City received a petition initiating the local TPA with the signatures of 60% of the persons who operate
lodging businesses in the City with 40 or more lodging units.

On July 14, 2010 the City Council adopted Ordinance 2010-32 establishing the TPA.

On May 26, 2011 the Hotel and Motel Commission approved the Tourism Promotion Area Business Plan and recommended
the proposed agreement between the City of Walla Walla and Tourism Walla Walla for tourism promotion services to include
administration of the TPA funds.

On June 8, 2011 the Council approved Resolution 2011-54 adopting the 2011-12 TPA Business Plan and authorizing the City
Manager to execute the necessary agreements.

On November 12, 2012 the Hotel and Motel Commission voted to recommend the TPA Business Plan for the first quarter of
2013 to the Council for approval. Kyle Mussman, Commission Chairman, affirmed that recommendation in his e-mail of
December 3, 2012, to Tim McCarty, Deputy City Manager, stating, "The H&MC did approve the 1st QT / $45,000 expenditure
for recommendation on 11/12/12."
On December 19, 2012 the Council approved Resolution 2012-95 , approving TPA Business Plan for the first quarter of 2013
and authorizing the City Manager to execute the associated agreements. The City Manager has executed an agreement with
Tourism Walla Walla to administer the TPA business plan at no cost for 2013 as stipulated in its proposed agreement with the
City. 
 
The Hotel and Motel Commission and Tourism Walla Walla are closely coordinating their marketing plans and scheduled
promotional activities for 2013 and beyond to complement one another's efforts. The Hotel and Motel Commission has
emphasized marketing of the "shoulder" seasons when weather in particular slows tourism.

On February 20, 2013 the Hotel and Motel Commission met with a quorum present and approved recommending the 2013
TPA Business Plan to the City Council for adoption.

POLICY ISSUES: The TPA has been established by Council according to RCW 35.101 and has modified Walla Walla Municipal
Code (WWMC) 2.25 to create the Hotel and Motel Commission; specify its membership; and outline its duties; added WWMC
3.15.065 to create the Tourism Promotion Fund; and added WWMC 3.79 to establish the Tourism Promotion Area. Specifically
related to this requested Council action:

2.25.230 Duties of the hotel and motel commission.
The hotel and motel commission shall advise and make recommendations to the city upon implementation of Chapter
3.79...the content of a tourism area promotion business plan to be adopted in accordance with Chapter 3.79, the uses to which
revenue from tourism promotion charges imposed in accordance with Chapter 3.79 shall be put, any contracting for tourism
promotion services to be paid from revenue from tourism promotion charges imposed in accordance with Chapter 3.79, and
proposed amendments to Chapter 3.79. (Ord. 2010-32 § 6, 2010).

TOURISM PROMOTION AREA
3.79.020 Definitions
E. "Tourism promotion area business plan" shall mean the budget for a fiscal year, as adopted or amended by the Walla Walla
city council, after receipt of a recommendation from the Walla Walla hotel and motel commission, identifying all estimated
revenue from tourism promotion charges imposed in accordance with this chapter for the fiscal year, and providing for all
proposed uses of such revenue for the purpose of providing tourism promotion for the ensuing fiscal year. (Ord. 2010-32 § 8
(part), 2010).

Due to unforeseen circumstances the Hotel and Motel Commission recommended and the City Council approved a Tourism
Promotion Area Business Plan for the first quarter of 2013 but not the full year. Consequently, the plan for the last three years
of 2013 is now before the Council for its consideration.

FINANCIAL IMPACTS:
Given the proposed classifications and rates, and based on the actual revenues collected in 2011 and 2012, the TPA fees are
expected to generate approximately $215,000 in 2013. The business plan will be adjusted as necessary to reflect actual
revenues. All revenue is to be dedicated to tourism promotion. Administrative costs to receive and disburse the funds; account
for them and their uses; support the audit of the accounting; and support the proposed Walla Walla Hotel and Motel
Commission are covered by the City. Administrative costs for tourism promotion in the business plan are provided at no cost by
Tourism Walla Walla as stipulated in its proposed agreement with the City.

ALTERNATIVES:
Disapprove the recommended TPA Business Plan for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2013 plan and request another
plan.

STAFF RECOMMENDATION:
Approve the resolution adopting the 2013 Tourism Promotion Area Business Plan for the last three quarters of 2013.

CITY MANAGER'S COMMENTS:
Approved for City Council action.

February 20, 2013

Marcus Whitman Hotel & Conference Center
Walla Walla Boardroom 1:00 PM

Attendance; Best Western Plus Walla Walla Suites, Super 8, Holiday Inn Express,
Hampton Inn & Suite, Marcus Whitman Hotel & Conference Center, Tim McCarty,
City of Walla Walla.

Last Meeting review of minutes;

Reviewed the DVA / TWW / H&MC Annual marketing plan and suggested some
changes and further research ­ this was done and an updated combined 2013
marketing was sent out to all board members, this has also since been approved by
the TWW Board and is attached.

Recommended the 2013 1st QT Off Season funds of $45,000.00 be funded by the City
of Walla Walla while we finalize the balance of 2013 referenced above. This has
since been approved and we are on track with expenditures for the Experience
Walla Walla campaign. We have also increased our Facebook likes to over 5,600
followers ­ this is even more important since the Tourism Walla Walla FB page got
inadvertently combined with the City of WW FB page and we lost the ability to
communicate to over 11,000 TWW followers.

We now make our recommendation to the City of WW to fund the balance of the
2013 Marketing Plan.

H&MC is requesting to contribute $110,000 for the Peak Season Tourism Walla
Walla Marketing Campaign April < September for 2013, with an emphasis on
Sunday through Thursday occupancy growth.

H&MC is requesting to fund the 4th QT Off Season Marketing Campaign from October
to December of $45,000.00 for 2013 with a focus on weekend and Sunday through
Thursday occupancy growth.

This would be a combined investment in Tourism Marketing of $200,000.00 for
2013 on our expected budget of TPA taxes collected of $214,000.00.

These recommendations were unanimously approved by the five hotels attending
the Hotel and Motel Commission meeting on February 20th, 2013 and we
respectfully ask the City Counsel to approve our ongoing investment in our tourism
efforts and Thank You All for your past support of our recommendations.

We are also very excited with the new addition of Mr. Ron Peck as the Executive
Director of Tourism Walla to help us in leading the growth for the benefit of all.

                     Administration
Financial Comments:  No immediate direct financial impact anticipated. However, the plan does obligate
                     city staff to collect data in 2013 and on an annual basis for benchmark tracking of
                     the items identified in the plan, so the cost associated with that work will be realized.

                                                           Information
ITEM TITLE:
Approval of Sustainability Plan.

HISTORY/POLICY ISSUES:
SUMMARY:  The Sustainability Committee has developed an Operations Sustainability Plan with input and feedback of city
staff including Directors, Chiefs, Deputy City Manager, and City Manager.  The purpose of the Plan is to begin formally tracking
the city's efforts to reduce consumption of natural resources thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money.
 
HISTORY:  In October 2008, by Resolution 2008-91, Council authorized the City Manager to establish an Ad Hoc Committee to
explore the various issues associated with a local sustainability agenda and present its recommendations to Council at the
culmination of the Committee's 120-day session.
 
The Ad Hoc Committee's June 2009 work session presentation resulted in a request for staff to prepare a report to Council
outlining the specific functions of a permanent committee within the city's organizational structure, as well as the projected
investment of staff time and budget to support the committee.
 
After Council's consideration of staff's report in October 2009, they directed staff to prepare an ordinance to form a
non-regulatory sustainability committee comprised of citizens residing within the City of Walla Walla.
 
Subsequently, Ordinance 2010-03 amending the municipal code to create a permanent citizen's advisory committee for
sustainability was passed on February 10, 2010.  The Sustainability Committee members were appointed in May 2010, and the
committee officially began meeting in July 2010.

In the time since its inception, and in accordance with the direction set forth in the Ordinance, the Committee has developed an
evaluation matrix tool that provides a balanced approach to assessing the sustainability aspects of proposals and projects. 
Additionally, the Committee has been asked by staff to evaluate and provide input on items such as street light technology
conversion, development code revision, glass recycling, and office copier specifications.  Concurrently, the Committee has
developed a process to conduct scenario planning exercises that may help the City to mitigate risk associated with economical,
environmental, or social changes in the future.
 
In January 2012, the Committee formed into work groups to concentrate on three areas of work to be undertaken by the group:
Scenario Planning, Comprehensive Plan Review, and Projects.  The Committee determined specific focus items for each of the
work group areas.  The Projects group was tasked with developing a Sustainability Plan for the City's operations.

The Committee presented the draft Plan to department directors in November 2012, and revised the Plan after receiving
feedback.  A subsequent revision was then presented to directors for additional feedback. City Manager Shawa approved
moving forward with presenting the draft Plan to Council at a worksession in early 2013.
 
The Committee presented the draft Plan for Council's consideration at the February 11, 2013, worksession.  With four Council
members present, staff was directed to prepare a report requesting formal adoption of the Operations Sustainability Plan at the
March 27 regular Council meeting. City Manager Shawa said he would facilitate getting feedback from the three remaining
Council members when they had a chance to review the draft Plan.
 
POLICY ISSUES:  Policy issues relating to the adoption of an Operations Sustainability Plan for the City will be a fundamental
component as the Plan is implemented.  It is intended for the Plan to encourage policies that will drive the decision-making
process for operations activity toward a more sustainable outcome.
 
Specifically, the purpose of the Operations Sustainability Plan is four-fold: 
       Help fulfill the City's commitment to sustainability by managing and balancing environmental, economic, and social
       resources in daily operations.
       Systematize and prioritize the process of implementing the sustainability elements of the Comprehensive Plan while
       aligning with the efforts of the Strategic Plan and Walla Walla Excellence program.
       Return value to the citizens by demonstrating in a visible way that the City's operations will make best use of citizens'
       tax dollars in an economical, ecological, and socially equitable manner.
       Help fulfill the City's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Policy adopted in April 2012.
 Supportive goals of the Comprehensive Plan in adopting an Operations Sustainability Plan are as follows: 
       Goal 1: Walla Walla will...seek wholeness through inclusivity and connectedness in the economic, social, and natural
       environments.  (Objectives 1, 3)
       Goal 2: Walla Walla will... seek ways to celebrate and preserve its unique character while adapting to change. 
       (Objective 4)
       Goal 6: Walla Walla will...protect and enhance its natural environment for the safety and enjoyment of this generation
       and those that follow.  (Objective 2)
       Goal 7: Walla Walla will...support transparency in local government operations to foster a collaborative relationship
       between residents and government.  (Objectives 3, 4)

FINANCIAL IMPACTS:
The initial year of the Plan will consist of gathering baseline data and determining the Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions
associated with operations activities. While the latter scope of work falls within the capacity of the Sustainability Coordinator's
current time allowance for support of the Committee, data gathering and reporting will involve numerous City staff across
several departments with the realization of the dedicated time and cost. Subsequent staff work including development of
objectives; measurement of performance; and addressing operational needs relevant to unrealized performance will involve
further and more significant staff time as well as other costs in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
An alternative to the proposed action would be to not adopt the Operations Sustainability Plan as proposed by the Sustainability
Committee.

STAFF RECOMMENDATION:
City staff recommends that Council approve the Resolution to formally adopt the Operations Sustainability Plan as proposed by
the Sustainability Committee.

CITY MANAGER'S COMMENTS:
Approved for City Council action, with the understanding that staff will work with the Sustainability Committee to achieve stated
goals, but given the significant workload and aggressive project schedule, there may be instances where current City priorities
take precedent.

Final Draft ­ February 5, 2013
                 City of Walla Walla
            Operations Sustainability Plan
Purpose
The purpose of this Sustainability Plan for City Operations is to

   Help fulfill the City's commitment to sustainability: managing and balancing
   environmental, economic, and social resources in its daily operations to meet current
   needs without sacrificing the needs of future generations

   Systematize and prioritize the process of implementing the sustainability elements of
   the City Comprehensive Plan while aligning with the City Strategic Plan and
   providing some of the elements required by the Baldridge project

   Return value to the citizens by demonstrating in a visible way (via the web and other
   communications) that City Operations work to make best use of their tax dollars with
   operations that are economical, ecological, and socially equitable

   Help fulfill the City's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Policy adopted April 25,
   2012

The City has already adopted many practices and programs consistent with a
commitment to sustainability (listed in Appendix A). With this Plan, the City recognizes
the achievements made to date, demonstrates its commitment to being sustainable, and
sets an example for the public, businesses, and community organizations.

Process
The City of Walla Walla Operations Sustainability Plan is a living document. The
Sustainability Advisory Committee in conjunction with City Staff will recommend to the
City Council the goals to be met for each coming year. Annually City Staff and the
Sustainability Advisory Committee will review progress and identify next steps.

As a first step toward developing this plan, the Sustainability Advisory Committee
developed a matrix to use in evaluating the sustainability of projects and practices. The
Committee then submitted a list of specific potential projects to Department Directors for
review and input. Following that, the Committee has prepared a draft of this plan for
consideration, revision, and discussion with general administrators, department
directors, and City Council. Finally, the Plan will be submitted to City Council for
approval.



                                             1
Final Draft ­ February 5, 2013
Long-Term Sustainability Goals
This plan identifies six long-term goals, based on projects listed in the Walla Walla
Urban Area Comprehensive Plan and generally accepted practice in the private and
public sectors. See some of the potential sustainability projects listed in the
Comprehensive Plan in Appendix B. The long-term goals are not listed here in any
order of priority, though the work plan itself proposes varying timelines for undertaking
specific projects and policies.
 Increase Organizational Commitment to and Employee Awareness of Sustainability
 Reduce Dependence on Non-Renewable Energy and Fuel Sources
 Reduce Use of Toxic Materials
 Reduce Water Use
 Reduce Waste
 Increase Sustainability of Facilities

Work Plan (Years One and Two)

Measuring, managing, and optimizing both existing sustainability practices and
emerging opportunities will accelerate the City's progress toward increased
sustainability. Each proposed project in the work plan should contain five elements:
   1. Performance Goal: what the desired outcome is
   2. Performance Measure: how results will be quantified
   3. Completion Date: when the outcome will be achieved
   4. Responsible: who is responsible for ensuring goal is met
   5. Strategy for Achieving Goal

For 2012-2013, the proposed goal is
  1. Goal: Create a Baseline for Measuring Future Progress toward Sustainability.
      The baseline will be total City operations data and annual measurements will be
      City operations totals. Achieving individual department goals will contribute to
      the long-term goals but will probably not be measurable at the department level.
  2. Measure: Baseline with data for all components
  3. Completion Date: December 31, 2013
  4. Responsible: The Sustainability Coordinator will gather data for electric use from
      Pacific Power and Columbia REA, for natural gas use from Cascade Natural
      Gas, for fuel from the Fleet Services Manager, for waste and water from the City
      Finance Department
  5. Strategy for Achieving Goal (Activities presently measurable for which a

Scenario Planning
Scenario planning is widely used in the private sector to anticipate and plan adaptation
to external changes that can affect a business profoundly. In the case of a local
government, it is important for scenario planning to consider the impact of such external
changes on the community as well as on the City and plan for adaptation to them. The
community expects leadership from local government in responding to major natural,
economic, and societal changes.

Some external changes with the potential to affect essential components of the City and
the community are energy, climate, and economic uncertainties, significant population
growth or loss, and technological revolution. Each of these might be expected to affect
food security, housing quality and availability, strength and diversity of the local
economy, functioning and cost of transportation and communication systems, public
and social services, and land-use planning.

Because of the intrinsic interdependence of the City and the community, scenario
planning may result in amendments to provisions and priorities in this Sustainability
Plan.

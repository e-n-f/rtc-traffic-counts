EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location and Description
The Town of Cary has received a proposal to develop a fifth building in an existing office park
located on the south side of Weston Parkway, between its intersections with Evans Road and
Norwell Boulevard. The new building will serve as an office building and is proposed to consist of
between 132,100 and 165,250 square feet. Based on the larger proposed office building size of
165,250 square feet, the number of trips generated by the office building was estimated. Trip
generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition to determine the
number of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is shown in Table 1.

The site plan for this parcel proposes the existing intersections of Weston Parkway and
Centregreen Way and Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2 as site driveways. This traffic
study, 13-TAR-377, analyzes the effects of the proposed development on traffic operations in the
study area. Figure ES 1 shows the study area for 13-TAR-377 while Figure ES 2 provides the
site plan.

Background Information
The number of trips generated by the proposed office building exceeds the Town's 50 peak hour
trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4) and
therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the town's Adequate Public
Facilities Ordinance (APFO). The projected build-out year for this development is 2014. This
TAR analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed office building on the adjacent roadways and
offers potential mitigation for those impacts as necessary.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
       2185 ­ Evans Road and Dynasty Drive/Rochelle Road (signalized)
       1898 ­ Evans Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
       1534 ­ Evans Road and Weston Parkway (signalized)
       1533 ­ Evans Road and Aviation Parkway (signalized)
       9001 ­ Weston Parkway and Norwell Boulevard (signalized)

                                                                                FINAL DRAFT

       2430 ­ Weston Parkway and Winstead Drive (signalized)
       1460 ­ Weston Parkway and N. Harrison Avenue (signalized) (beyond one mile, will
       check the 7% rule)
       9002 ­ Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard (unsignalized)
       9003 ­ Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way (unsignalized)
       9004 ­ Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2 (unsignalized)

Traffic analyses were performed for the study area intersections listed above for four scenarios,
specifically:
       Existing (2013) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts, aerial photography, and site visit).
       Background (2014) ­ Estimates future (2014) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 2%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby developments that
       have not yet been constructed.
       Combined (2014) ­ Adds the site generated traffic from the proposed development to the
       Background (2014) volumes.
       Combined (2014) and Improved ­ If necessary, analyzes potential mitigations to provide
       acceptable levels of service based on the Town's LDO.

Background (2014) Analysis
Future year traffic estimates were made based on applying an overall average annual growth
rate (AAGR) to the 2013 balanced counts. An AAGR of 2% was assumed for the study area. An
estimate of new trips expected by the future occupation of currently vacant space within the
Centregreen Office development was also included. Additionally, traffic from the following
approved developments was considered and incorporated as appropriate:
           o   08-TAR-296A Weston Parkway Property
           o   11-TAR-322 Lofts at Weston Lakeside
           o   12-TAR-339B SAS Update
           o   13-TAR-357A Singh Residential

APFO Required Mitigations
Two signalized intersections and two unsignalized intersections fell below the APFO threshold
with the additional site traffic. As such, mitigation was recommended for these intersections,
which is described below and shown in Figure ES 3.

   Evans Road and Cary Parkway
   This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS E in the PM peak period
   in the Combined (2014) conditions with increased delay in the PM peak period from the
   Background (2014) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in overall
   intersection delay is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS

D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, the following mitigation is
recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

       Provide an exclusive southbound right-turn lane with 425 feet of storage and
       appropriate taper.

With this mitigation, the intersection operates at LOS D in the PM peak period with less
overall intersection delay than experienced in the Background (2014) conditions.

Weston Parkway/Richard Drive and N. Harrison Avenue
This intersection operates at LOS C in the AM peak period and LOS E in the PM peak period
in the Combined (2014) conditions with increased delay in the PM peak period as compared
to the Background (2014) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in
overall intersection delay is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below
the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone; therefore, mitigation is
required at this intersection in order to meet APFO requirements.

Several potential mitigations were considered for this intersection. The initial mitigation
considered was to optimize the signal timing (cycle length and splits). Because the signal is
currently progressed along Harrison Boulevard and no other signals on Harrison Boulevard
are included in this analysis, this mitigation was not pursued. Potential geometric
improvements considered included restriping the eastbound approach to provide three
exclusive left-turn lanes and one shared through and right-turn lane, along with signal timing
modifications. However, due to sight distance concerns, geometric challenges, and the
concern in modifying signal timings previously mentioned, this mitigation is not
recommended. Therefore, the following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's
APFO:

           o   Convert the existing full southbound right-turn lane to a through lane.
           o   Extend the outside southbound receiving lane to provide 1,000 feet of a full
               lane with appropriate taper distance for merging.
           o   Provide an exclusive southbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper
               beginning just south of the existing right-in and right-out driveway
               (approximately 400 feet from driveway to stop bar at Weston Parkway) and
               maintain the free flow movement that exists today.


With this mitigation, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS D, in the
PM peak period, and with less intersection delay than experienced in the Background (2014)
conditions.

   Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard
   This intersection has three movements, the shared northbound left, through and right-turn,
   the southbound through and left-turn, and the southbound right-turn that operate at LOS E in
   the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7b
   indicate that these movements have an increase in delay when compared to the Background
   (2014) analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at unsignalized intersections, no
   movement is allowed to experience a drop in level of service that result in operations below
   LOS D and no increase in delay time is allowed for movements with a level of service below
   the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is
   required at this intersection in order to meet the APFO requirements.

   Geometric improvements, such as exclusive turn lanes, were considered; but did not reduce
   delay enough to meet the requirements of the APFO; therefore, an evaluation of peak hour
   signal warrants was performed and is included in Appendix I. The peak hour signal warrant
   evaluation indicates this intersection will meet the peak hour signal warrant in the Combined
   (2014) scenario. While meeting one signal warrant does not guarantee the installation of a
   signal, the intersection was analyzed as a signalized intersection in the Combined (2014)
   Improved conditions. With the provision of a three-phase signal, this intersection will operate
   at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak periods, which meets the requirements of the APFO.

   Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way
   This intersection has one movement, the northbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in both
   the AM and PM peak periods of the Combined (2014) conditions with an increase in delay
   and reduction in level of service from the Background (2014) conditions in the AM peak
   period and increase in delay in the PM peak period. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at
   unsignalized intersections, no movement is allowed to operate below LOS D and no increase
   in delay time is allowed for movements with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for
   the Base Benefit Transportation Zone; therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in
   order to meet the APFO requirements.

   Geometric improvements, such as exclusive turn lanes, were considered but did not reduce
   delay enough to meet the requirements of the APFO; therefore, an evaluation of peak hour
   signal warrants was performed and is included in Appendix I. The peak hour signal warrant
   evaluation indicates this intersection will meet the peak hour signal warrant in the Combined
   (2014) scenario. While meeting one signal warrant does not guarantee the installation of a
   signal, the intersection was analyzed as a signalized intersection in the Combined (2014)
   Improved conditions. With the provision of a three-phase signal, this intersection will operate
   at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak periods, which meets the requirements of the APFO.

Table 2a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the Background (2014),
Combined (2014) and Combined (2014) Improved conditions. The results provided in Table 2a
show that with the potential mitigations evaluated for the Evans Road and Cary Parkway

intersection and the Weston Parkway and Richard Drive/Harrison Avenue intersection, both
intersections will meet the requirements of the APFO. Table 2a also shows that all other
signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better in all scenarios and do not require mitigation
to meet APFO requirements.

Table 2b provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersections in the Background (2014),
Combined (2014) and Combined (2014) Improved conditions. As indicated in Table 2b, without
mitigation the Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard intersection and the Weston Parkway and
Centregreen Way intersection do not meet the APFO requirements. With the provision of a three
phase signal at each of these locations, both intersections operate at an overall LOS B in both
the AM and PM peak periods. While both intersections meet the peak hour signal warrant, it
should be noted that does not guarantee the signal is warranted; however, with the provision of
signal both intersections satisfy the requirements of the Town of Cary's APFO. Table 2b also
shows that the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2 intersection meets the APFO
requirements in the Combined (2014) conditions and does not require mitigation.

1.      INTRODUCTION
The Town of Cary has received a proposal to develop a fifth building in an existing office park
located on the south side of Weston Parkway, between its intersections with Evans Road and
Norwell Boulevard. The new building will serve as an office building and is proposed to consist of
between 132,100 and 165,250 square feet. The site plan for this parcel proposes the existing
intersections of Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way and Weston Parkway and Centregreen
Access 2 as site driveways. Figure 1 provides the study area and site location. All figures are
located in Appendix A.

Based on the larger proposed office building size of 165,250 square feet, the number of trips
generated by the office building exceeds the Town's 50 peak hour trip threshold for development
(Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a Traffic
Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit
Transportation Zone" as identified in the Town's Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO).
The projected build-out year for this development is 2014. This TAR analyzes the potential
impacts of the proposed office building on the adjacent roadways and offers potential mitigation
for those impacts. The site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
        2185 ­ Evans Road and Dynasty Drive/Rochelle Road (signalized)
        1898 ­ Evans Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)

2.      EXISTING (2013) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.

        2.1.1. WESTON PARKWAY
        Weston Parkway is an east-west connector that runs from NC 54 to Harrison Avenue and
        has a posted speed limit of 45 mph. The typical section of Weston Parkway within the
        study area is a four-lane median divided roadway. Weston Parkway had a 2011 AADT
        ranging from 6,200 vehicles per day just east of NC 54 to 17,000 vehicles per day west of
        Harrison Avenue (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

        2.1.2. CARY PARKWAY (SR 3977)
        Cary Parkway is a major connector that runs from Holly Springs Road in southeastern
        Cary to Harrison Avenue in northern Cary, providing a partial loop around western Cary.
        The typical section of Cary Parkway is a four-lane median divided roadway from Holly
        Springs Road to Evans Road and is a two-lane undivided roadway north of Evans Road,
        through the study area. Cary Parkway has a posted speed limit of 45 mph. The Town of
        Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies the vision to extend Cary
        Parkway as a two-lane median divided roadway east from Harrison Avenue to Trinity
        Road; however, construction is not anticipated before 2022. Within the study area

   Rochelle Road intersects Evans Road across from Dynasty Drive, is a short east-west
   local facility, and serves residential land use. The typical section of Rochelle Road in the
   study area is a two-lane undivided roadway. Rochelle Road does not have a posted
   speed limit. AADT data was not available for this facility.

2.2.       Existing Intersections
All analyzed intersections within the study area are listed in Section 1 of this report and are
within the Town Limits of Cary or within the Town of Cary's ETJ, except for the intersection of
Aviation Parkway and Evans Road, which is within the Town of Morrisville's jurisdiction .
Intersection geometrics along with intersection operation controls are provided in Figure 3.
Existing signal timings and plans were obtained from the Town of Cary and NCDOT for use in
this TAR. They are located in Appendix B.

2.3.       Turning Movement Counts
Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
June 2013 for all intersections. The count data is located in Appendix C. These counts
were taken to provide current volumes and assist in determining the directional splits of
existing traffic. The count volumes were balanced in areas where appropriate based on
access points between count locations, and were grown one year at the determined growth
rate (discussed in Section 3.1) to estimate 2014 volumes. The volumes that were used in the
Existing (2013) analyses are shown on Figure 4 and the volume calculations are located in
Appendix D. Table 1 lists the time and place counts were conducted. There are several
schools in the study area that could affect traffic flow. Given the proximity of counts to the
end of the traditional school year, nearby school schedules were obtained to assist in
determining an appropriate time to count the study area intersections. This information was
coordinated with the Town of Cary and a count schedule was set. The school information is
located in Appendix C.

Exhibit 19-1 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are provided in Table 3 below.

         Table 3: Level of Service Criteria for Stop-Controlled Intersections
                    Level of Service Average Control Delay (s/veh)

                            A                       0-10

                            B                      >10-15

The proposed Centregreen Office expansion is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Zone which is described in Section 3.23.3 of the LDO. For areas located within the
Base Benefit Zone, the level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are
based on achieving a LOS D or better for all intersections located within the study area
(measured overall for signalized intersections and by movement for unsignalized
intersections) currently operating at LOS D or better or not increasing delay (overall
intersection delay for signalized and movement for unsignalized) for those
intersections/movements having a level of service worse than LOS D without the
development in the build-out year.

2.5.      Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. The following Synchro coding
assumptions were made for existing conditions and included in all future analyses unless
otherwise noted:

       A default value of four vehicles was input for movements where zero vehicles were
       counted based on NCDOT's Capacity Analysis Guidelines. The only exceptions to
       this are at the two site access driveways which we did not want to alter actual count
       volumes for and the northbound and southbound movements at the Cary Parkway
       and Norwell Boulevard intersection. If the northbound and southbound through
       movements at the Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard intersection were increased
       to four vehicles, those volumes would either be equal to or larger than either the other
       volumes on those approaches or the volumes exiting the approach to which they are
       destined. Given this information, the site driveway counts were not modified if there

                                                                                  13-TAR-377
                                                                           Centregreen Office
                                                                               FINAL DRAFT

       was a zero count and a value of one was used for the Cary Parkway and Norwell
       Boulevard northbound and southbound through movements if there was a zero count.
       Multiple unsignalized intersections had U-turning movements in at least one peak
       period.    In these instances, U-turning movements were added to left-turning
       movements to provide a more realistic level of service since Synchro does not
       account for U-turn movements at unsignalized intersections in its level of service
       calculations. Synchro files with the U-turning movements were also maintained for all
       scenarios for simulation purposes.
       The AM peak hour traffic counts at the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2
       intersection showed four vehicles making a westbound left-turn movement. Data
       collected during a field visit indicated that there is signage prohibiting left-turns and U-
       turns on the westbound approach at this intersection. Therefore, the existing four U-
       turning vehicles in the AM peak hour were removed from this intersection and added
       as westbound left-turns at the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way intersection.
       The existing signalized intersection of Weston Parkway and Harrison Oaks
       Boulevard/Renaissance Park Place was included in the Synchro analyses for
       simulation purposes, since the inside westbound through lane drops as a left-turn lane
       and this signal is part of a coordinated system. Counts were obtained from the Town
       of Cary and balanced using adjacent counts and growth rate estimates. This
       intersection is not one of the study intersections and is not included in this report.
       The dual northbound left-turn lanes at the Harrison Avenue and Weston
       Parkway/Richard Drive have different storage lengths. The average storage length of
       the two turn lanes was coded into Synchro.

Levels of service and delay were reported for each yielding movement at unsignalized
intersections. For signalized intersections, levels of service and delay were reported for the
signal as a whole. The summary of the findings for the Existing (2013) analyses are located
in Table 4a and 4b below.

   As shown in Table 4a, all signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better in both peak
   periods.

   As shown in Table 4b, all movements at the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2
   intersection operate better than the level of service criteria of LOS D for the Base Benefit
   Transportation Zone, while the Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard intersection and the
   Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way intersection have movements operating at LOS E or
   LOS F in at least one of the peak periods. The intersection of Cary Parkway and Norwell
   Boulevard has one movement, the shared northbound left, through, and right-turn, that
   operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period, while the shared
   southbound through and left-turn and the southbound right-turn operates at LOS F in the PM
   peak period. The intersection of Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way has one movement,
   the northbound left-turn, that operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM
   peak period. The Existing (2013) analysis results are located in Appendix E.

3.      BACKGROUND (2014) CONDITIONS
     3.1.       Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information from NCDOT and the Town of Cary, developing land
     uses in the area, and information from adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth
     rate of 2% was used for the study area. This growth rate was applied to the existing 2013
     volumes to determine the projected volumes for the Background (2014) analysis. The only
     exceptions to this are on the turning movements at the site driveways, Weston Parkway and
     Centregreen Way intersection and the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2
     intersection. Information obtained from Highwoods Properties, which leases out the
     Centregreen office space, indicated that the existing office development is currently 96%
     occupied. For the purposes of this analysis, the existing vacant space was assumed to be
     50% occupied by the 2014 build out of the proposed office building, bringing the total
     estimated occupancy to 98% in the 2014 analysis year. In order to estimate the amount of
     traffic generated by this newly occupied space, a ratio was developed between the existing
     traffic counts and the amount of office space currently occupied. This ratio was then applied
     to half of the estimated currently vacant space (assuming 50% occupancy by the 2014 build
     out year of the proposed office building) to estimate the number of new trips that could be
     expected at the driveways in the 2014 buildout year. These trips were assigned to the site
     driveways and distributed through the network based on the site trip distribution for the
     proposed office building, which is described in Section 4.2 of this TAR.

     There were also additional trips added to account for known approved developments that are
     not yet constructed. These trips were based on other TARs provided by the Town of Cary.
     Previously analyzed development trip generation information as well as the total approved
     development site trips added to the network are located in Appendix F. The total 2014
     Background traffic volumes, which includes the approved development trips, are shown in
     Figure 5. The following are the approved developments included in the background traffic for
     this TAR:

            o   08-TAR-296A Weston Parkway Property
            o   11-TAR-322 Lofts at Weston Lakeside
            o   12-TAR-339B SAS Update
            o   13-TAR-357A Singh Residential

        3.1.1. 08-TAR-296A ­ W ESTON PARKWAY PROPERTY
        The Weston Parkway Property TAR was conducted for a proposed mixed-use
        development in the northeast quadrant of the NC 54 (Chapel Hill Road) and Weston
        Parkway intersection. The TAR states that the development will consist of 40,000 square
        feet of retail space, 308 apartment units, 155 condominium units, and 35 townhome units.
        The TAR also states that the development will be constructed in two phases, with Phase

   1 complete in 2012 and Phase 2 complete in 2014. Based on information provided by
   Town of Cary staff, construction of this development is unlikely to be complete by 2014;
   therefore, the site traffic from this development will not be included in this analysis.

   3.1.2. 11-TAR-322 ­ LOFTS AT WESTON LAKESIDE
   The Lofts at Weston Lakeside TAR was conducted for a proposed residential
   development on Old Reedy Creek Road, north of Weston Parkway. The TAR states that
   the development will consist of 240 apartments and be complete by 2012. Based on
   observations during a field visit, the Lofts at Weston Lakeside was partially built out, with
   only a few units occupied. Therefore, the site traffic for this development will be added to
   the background traffic and included in this analysis.

   3.1.3. 12-TAR-339B ­ SAS UPDATE
   The SAS Update TAR was conducted for a proposed office building located on the SAS
   Campus in northern Cary. The development will consist of 220,004 square feet of office
   space and is estimated to be complete by 2014. While there are no common
   intersections between the SAS Update TAR and this TAR, for this analysis the SAS
   development traffic assigned to Harrison Avenue will be added as through trips on
   Harrison Avenue at the Harrison Avenue and Weston Parkway intersection.

   3.1.4. 13-TAR-357A ­ SINGH RESIDENTIAL
   The Singh Residential TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development
   located in the southeast quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection. The
   development will consist of 216 apartments and is estimated to be complete by 2015.
   Based on information provided by Town of Cary Planning staff, there are currently no
   approved plans for construction of this development. It is anticipated that review and
   approval of plans is not likely to be complete before mid-2014. Therefore, the site traffic
   from this development will not be included in this analysis.

3.2.       Level of Service Analysis
Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2014) AM and PM peak hours. This analysis includes the approved
development site trips described in the above section along with one year of annual growth of
existing traffic from 2013 to 2014 using the 2% annual growth rate.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2014) analysis are shown by Figure 5. The
existing laneage was also used and is shown in Figure 3. The summary of the level of
service analysis for the Background (2014) conditions is reported in Tables 5a and 5b.

 operates at LOS E in the PM peak period.

 Table 5b indicates that, as in the Existing (2013) analysis, all movements at the Weston
 Parkway and Centregreen Access 2 intersection operate better than the level of service
 criteria of LOS D for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone, while the Cary Parkway and
 Norwell Boulevard intersection and the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way intersection
 have movements operating at LOS E or LOS F in at least one of the peak periods. The
 intersection of Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard has one movement, the shared
 northbound left, through and right-turn, which operates at LOS E in the AM peak period and
 LOS F in the PM peak period, while the shared southbound through and left-turn and the
 southbound right-turn operate at LOS F in the PM peak period. The intersection of Weston

4.      COMBINED (2014) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Transportation Zone; therefore, recommendations will be based on a level of service
standard of "D". The proposed expansion of the Centregreen Office development is proposed to
consist of 165,250 square feet of office. The site plan for this parcel proposes using the existing
full movement intersection of Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way as an access driveway.
The site plan also proposes using the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2 intersection
as an access driveway but will close the median access, restricting movements to right-in/right-
out only.

The intersection of Weston Parkway and Harrison Avenue is outside the one mile radius stated in
the LDO for inclusion in the TAR and therefore it was evaluated for the 7% rule. The 7% rule
states that if the proposed site generated traffic is at least 7% of any traffic movement approach
volume it should be included in the study area and analysis. If the intersection meets the 7% rule
and the proposed site generated traffic exceeds 1% of the total approach volume for any
approach, then mitigation is required in accordance with the APFO. The intersection of Weston
Parkway and Harrison Avenue met the 7% rule and it was included in the traffic study. The site
traffic also met the 1% rule; therefore, the intersection was evaluated for mitigation. The 7% and
1% calculations for the Harrison Avenue and Weston Parkway intersection are included in
Appendix D.

     4.1.        Trip Generation
     Trip generation rates from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition were used to
     determine the number of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is
     shown in Table 6.

     4.2.        Trip Distribution
     Access to the proposed office building is planned to be provided via one full movement
     driveway and one right-in/right-out driveway on Weston Parkway. Trip distribution was
     estimated based on count data from the existing site driveway intersections and nearby
     intersections along with knowledge of local trip attractions and destinations in the area. The
     AM and PM peak hour site trip distribution percentages are shown on Figures 6.1 and 6.2,

generation and distribution calculations are located in Appendix D.

4.3.       Combined (2014) Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2014) scenario consists of the Background (2014) traffic as discussed in
Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed development. The
volumes that are used in the Combined (2014) analysis are shown in Figure 8. The laneage
and traffic control used for the Combined (2014) scenario are based on the existing
conditions, provided by Figure 3, as well as the site plan, provided by Figure 2. The site
plan indicates that the existing median opening at the Weston Parkway and Centregreen
Access 2 intersection will be closed and the westbound left-turn lane at the Weston Parkway
and Centregreen Way intersection will be extended to provide approximately 375 feet of full
storage upon the completion of the proposed new office building. As a result, movements at
the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2 intersection will be restricted to right-in/right-
out only and rerouted to the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way intersection.

Both access driveways shown on the site plan in Figure 2 were analyzed under stop control.
The evaluated laneage was taken from the proposed site plan.

Level of service analyses were performed for the Combined (2014) conditions. A summary of
the levels of service is found in Tables 7a and 7b below.

   As shown in Tables 7a, most signalized intersections experience little to no change between
   the Background (2014) and Combined (2014) scenarios. However, two intersections operate
   below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. The Cary Parkway and
   Evans Road intersection shows an increase in delay, that results in the LOS degrading from
   LOS D to LOS E in the PM peak period when compared to the Background (2014) analyses.
   Also, as with the Background (2014) analyses, the Weston Parkway/Richard Drive and
   Harrison Avenue intersection operates at LOS E in the PM peak period; however, the results
   provided in Table 7a indicate that this intersection shows an increase in delay when
   compared to the Background (2014) analyses. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO,
   signalized intersections in the Base Benefit Transportation Zone should operate at LOS D or
   better or show no increase in delay time. Therefore, improvements will be required at both of
   these intersections in order to mitigate increases in delay time and meet the APFO
   requirements. The proposed improvements are described in Section 4.4.

   As shown in Table 7b, with the enhancements shown on the site plan in Figure 2, all
   movements at the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2 intersection operate better
   than the level of service criteria of LOS D for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Two
   intersections, the Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard intersection and the Weston Parkway
   and Centregreen Way intersection, have movements operating at LOS E or LOS F in at least

one of the peak periods. All northbound and southbound movements at the Cary Parkway
and Norwell Boulevard intersection operate at LOS E in the AM peak period and LOS F in the
PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7b indicate that these movements degrade
from LOS D to LOS E or show an increase in delay when compared to the Background
(2014) conditions. The Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way intersection has one
movement, the northbound left-turn, that degrades from LOS E to LOS F in the AM peak
period and shows an increase in delay of 332.9 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak period
when compared to the Background (2014) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO,
movements at unsignalized intersections in the Base Benefit Transportation Zone should
operate at LOS D or better or show no increase in delay time. Therefore, improvements will
be required at these intersections in order to mitigate increases in delay and meet the APFO
requirements. The proposed improvements are described in Section 4.4 while the Combined
(2014) analyses are located in Appendix H.

The following provides the results of the Combined (2014) analyses and how they relate to
the APFO requirements.

Evans Road and Dynasty Drive/Rochelle Road
This intersection operates at LOS A in both the AM and PM peak periods. Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Evans Road and Cary Parkway
This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS E in the PM peak period.
The results provided in Table 7a indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in
delay of 4.7 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak period when compared to the Background
(2014) analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in overall intersection
delay is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection
in order to meet APFO requirements. These improvements are described in Section 4.4.

Evans Road and Weston Parkway
This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS C in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Evans Road and Aviation Parkway
This intersection operates at LOS D in both the AM and PM peak periods. Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Weston Parkway and Norwell Boulevard
This intersection operates at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak periods. Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Weston Parkway and Winstead Drive
This intersection operates at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak periods. Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Weston Parkway/Richard Drive and N. Harrison Avenue
This intersection operates at LOS C in the AM peak period and LOS E in the PM peak period.
The results provided in Table 7a indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in
delay of 5.8 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak period when compared to the Background
(2014) analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in overall intersection
delay is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone; therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection
in order to meet APFO requirements. This mitigation is described in Section 4.4.

Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard
This intersection has three movements, the shared northbound left, through and right-turn,
the southbound through and left-turn, and the southbound right-turn that operate at LOS E in
the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7b
indicate that these movements have an increase in delay when compared to the Background
(2014) analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at unsignalized intersections no
movement is allowed to experience a drop in level of service to operate below LOS D and no
increase in delay time is allowed for movements with a level of service below the LOS D
threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this
intersection in order to meet the APFO requirements. This mitigation is described in Section
4.4.

Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way
This intersection has one movement, the northbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in both
the AM and PM peak periods. The results provided in Table 7b indicate that the northbound
left-turn movement shows an increase in delay of 119.4 seconds per vehicle in the AM peak
period, reducing the level of service from LOS E to LOS F when compared to the Background
(2014) analysis. Additionally, an increase in delay of 332.9 seconds per vehicle is shown for
the PM peak period when compared to the Background (2014) analysis. Based on Section
3.23.3 of the LDO, at unsignalized intersections, no movement is allowed to reduce in level of
service to operate below LOS D and no increase in delay time is allowed for movements with
a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone;
therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in order to meet the APFO requirements.
This mitigation is described in Section 4.4.

Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2
Since all movements at this intersection are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

4.4.       Combined (2014) Improved Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2014) Improved scenario consists of potential mitigations identified in order to
meet the LOS D threshold or show no increase in overall intersection/movement delay if the
intersection/movement operates below LOS D in the Background (2014) condition as noted in
Section 4.3. As noted in Section 4.3, two signalized intersections and two unsignalized
intersections meet these criteria in the Combined (2014) conditions. The intersections
requiring mitigation are listed below, along with the potential mitigation. The Combined
(2014) Improved Synchro analyses are located in Appendix I.

Evans Road and Cary Parkway
This intersection operates at LOS D in the AM peak period and LOS E in the PM peak period
in the Combined (2014) conditions with increased delay in the PM peak period from the
Background (2014) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in overall
intersection delay is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS
D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, the following mitigation is
recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

       Provide an exclusive southbound right-turn lane with 425 feet of storage and
       appropriate taper.

With this mitigation, the intersection operates at LOS D in the PM peak period with less
overall intersection delay than experienced in the Background (2014) conditions.

Weston Parkway/Richard Drive and N. Harrison Avenue
This intersection operates at LOS C in the AM peak period and LOS E in the PM peak period
in the Combined (2014) conditions with increased delay in the PM peak period as compared
to the Background (2014) conditions. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in
overall intersection delay is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below
the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone; therefore, mitigation is
required at this intersection in order to meet APFO requirements.

Several potential mitigations were considered for this intersection. The initial mitigation
considered was to optimize the signal timing (cycle length and splits). Because the signal is
currently progressed along Harrison Boulevard and no other signals on Harrison Boulevard
are included in this analysis, this mitigation was not pursued. Potential geometric
improvements considered included restriping the eastbound approach to provide three
exclusive left-turn lanes and one shared through and right-turn lane, along with signal timing
modifications. However, due to sight distance concerns, geometric challenges, and the
concern in modifying signal timings previously mentioned, this mitigation is not
recommended. Therefore, the following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's
APFO:

                                                                         Centregreen Office
                                                                             FINAL DRAFT

           o   Convert the existing full southbound right-turn lane to a through lane.
           o   Extend the outside southbound receiving lane to provide 1,000 feet of a full
               lane with appropriate taper distance for merging.
           o   Provide an exclusive southbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper
               beginning just south of the existing right-in and right-out driveway
               (approximately 400 feet from driveway to southbound stop bar at Weston
               Parkway) and maintain the free flow movement that exists today.


With this mitigation, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS D, in the
PM peak period, and with less intersection delay than experienced in the Background (2014)
conditions.

Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard
This intersection has three movements, the shared northbound left, through and right-turn,
the southbound through and left-turn, and the southbound right-turn that operate at LOS E in
the AM peak period and LOS F in the PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7b
indicate that these movements have an increase in delay when compared to the Background
(2014) analysis Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at unsignalized intersections, no
movement is allowed to experience a drop in level of service that result in operations below
LOS D and no increase in delay time is allowed for movements with a level of service below
the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone Therefore, mitigation is
required at this intersection in order to meet the APFO requirements.

Geometric improvements, such as exclusive turn lanes, were considered; but did not reduce
delay enough to meet the requirements of the APFO; therefore, an evaluation of peak hour
signal warrants was performed and is included in Appendix I. The peak hour signal warrant
evaluation indicates this intersection will meet the peak hour signal warrant in the Combined
(2014) scenario. While meeting one signal warrant does not guarantee the installation of a
signal, the intersection was analyzed as a signalized intersection in the Combined (2014)
Improved conditions. With the provision of a three-phase signal, this intersection will operate
at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak periods, which meets the requirements of the APFO.

Weston Parkway and Centregreen Way
This intersection has one movement, the northbound left-turn, that operates at LOS F in both
the AM and PM peak periods of the Combined (2014) conditions with an increase in delay
and reduction in level of service from the Background (2014) conditions in the AM peak
period and increase in delay in the PM peak period. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at
unsignalized intersections, no movement is allowed to operate below LOS D and no increase
in delay time is allowed for movements with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for
the Base Benefit Transportation Zone; therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in
order to meet the APFO requirements.

  4.5.       Conclusions
  Table 9a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the Background (2014),
  Combined (2014), and Combined (2014) Improved conditions. The results provided in Table
  9a show that with the potential mitigations evaluated for the Evans Road and Cary Parkway
  intersection and the Weston Parkway and Richard Drive/Harrison Avenue intersection, both
  intersections will meet the requirements of the APFO. Table 9a also shows that all other
  signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better in all scenarios and do not require
  mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

  Table 9b provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersections in the Background (2014),
  Combined (2014), and Combined (2014) Improved conditions. As indicated in Table 9b,
  without mitigation the Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard intersection and the Weston
  Parkway and Centregreen Way intersection do not meet the APFO requirements. With the
  provision of a three phase signal at each of these locations, both intersections operate at an
  overall LOS B in both the AM and PM peak periods. While both intersections meet the peak
  hour signal warrant, it should be noted that does not guarantee the signal is warranted;
  however, with the provision of signal both intersections satisfy the requirements of the Town
  of Cary's APFO. Table 9b also shows that the Weston Parkway and Centregreen Access 2
  intersection meets the APFO requirements in the Combined (2014) conditions and does not
  require mitigation. The proposed build laneage in 2014 for the planned Centregreen Office
  development is shown on Figure 9.

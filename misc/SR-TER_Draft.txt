1.      Introduction

1.1     BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

The  widening  of  Silverbell  Road  from  Ina  Road  to  Grant  Road  is  a  Regional  Transportation 
Authority  (RTA)  funded  roadway  project.  This  traffic  engineering  report  was  prepared  as  part  of 
the design process for the section of Silverbell Road from Ina Road to Grant Road. Study area maps 
are provided in Exhibit 1.  

The  purpose  of  this  traffic  report  is  to  evaluate  existing  and  future  (2040)  traffic  conditions  and 
provide  specific  recommendations  to  be  used  for  the  design  of  improvements  on  Silverbell  Road.  
These recommendations include the lane configuration at signalized intersections, turn lane storage 
requirements,  traffic  control  requirements,  location  and  configuration  of  median  openings, 
pedestrian, bicycle and transit features, and the need for roadway lighting.

2.      Existing Conditions

2.1     ROADWAY

Silverbell Road is classified as an urban principal arterial and considered a scenic route by both City 
of  Tucson  and  Pima  County.  Its  cross  section  generally  consists  of  two  lanes,  the  width  of  which 
varies  from  11  to  12  feet.  Sidewalks  are  provided  near  the  Grant  Road  intersection.  Sixfoot  paved 
shoulders  exist  between  Goret  Road  and  Grant  Road.  Paved  shoulders  vary  in  width  from  4  to  6 
feet  from  Goret  Road  to  Sunset  Road.  North  of  Sunset  Road  and  nearly  to  Ina  Road,  paved 
shoulders  are  one  foot  wide.  A  short  frontage  road  runs  along  the  east  side  of  Silverbell  Road  from 
just  north  of  Belmont  Road  to  south of  Silver  Ridge  Lane.  Seventeen  residences  utilize  this  frontage 
road  to  access  Silverbell  Road.  The  vertical  roadway  alignment  generally  follows  the  existing 
rolling  terrain  with  many  atgrade  drainage  crossings.  Based  on  a  review  of  the  AASHTO 
controlling  design  criteria  for  Silverbell  Road,  there  appear  to  be  four  horizontal  curves  and  20 
vertical  curves  that  do  not  meet  sight  distance  requirements.  The  AASHTO  review  is  provided  in 
Appendix A.  Existing access points along Silverbell Road are summarized in Exhibit 2.

2.2     LAND USE

The  Silverbell  Road  corridor,  from  Ina  Road  to  Grant  Road  lies  in  three  jurisdictions;  the  Town  of 
Marana,  Pima  County,  and  the  City  of  Tucson.    Currently,  a  large  portion  of  the  property  within 
each  jurisdiction  is  undeveloped.    Since  existing  and  future  land  use  will  influence  both  the 
functional  requirements  of  the  roadway  as  well  as  the  character  of  the  corridor,  it  is  important  to 
establish a clear understanding of how properties along this section of Silverbell Road will develop. 
This  was  accomplished  by  preparing  a  detailed  land  use  and  zoning  analysis  for  the  corridor.  The 
analysis  report,  which  is  included  in  Appendix  B,  describes  a  likely  corridor  development  scenario 
based  on  a  review  of  existing  zoning,  existing  land  uses,  and  planned  developments,   review  of  the 
current  comprehensive  plans  for  each  jurisdiction,  as  well  as  discussions  with  planning  staff  from 
the Town, County, and City.  A general summary of this corridor development scenario is provided 
below.

Silverbell Road ­ Ina Road to Grant Road                                                            November 2009



Grant Road to Goret Road
This  section  is  nearly  fully  developed  with  a  mix  of  existing  retail,  commercial  and  residential  land 
uses.  Retail  and  commercial  uses,  including  an  auto  shop,  car  wash,  restaurants,  a  supermarket, 
fueling  stations,  banks,  and  retail  stores  are  centered  at  the  Grant  Road  intersection.  North  of  the 
Grant  Road  intersection,  the  majority  existing  development  on  both  sides  of  the  roadway  includes 
low to moderate density residential subdivisions. Blended in with the residences are an architecture 
office  and  a  charter  school  (Luz  Academy)  on  the  west  side  and  a  nursery  and  trailer  park  on  the 
east side. Sunset Ranch, which includes the nursery and the trailer park, was recently rezoned to C
1  and  redevelopment  plans  for  this  property  include  an  office  park  and  a  storage  facility.  The 
architecture  office  resides  on  a  large  parcel  that  is  zoned  C1  (Commercial);  however  full 
development of this property will require significant floodplain mitigation. 

Goret Road to El Camino del Cerro
Much of the land along the west side of Silverbell Road between Goret Road and Sweetwater Drive 
was purchased and rezoned as Open Space  by  the  City  of  Tucson.  Most  of  the  land on  the  east  side 
within  this  segment  is also  owned  by  the  City  of  Tucson  and  includes  the  Silverbell  Municipal  Golf 
Course  and  Christopher  Columbus  Park.  The  City  of  Tucson  plans  to  expand  the  Christopher 
Columbus  Park  further  north  and  add  athletic  fields  in  the  northeast  and  southeast  corners  of  the 
Silverbell/El  Camino  Del  Cerro  intersection.  Two  residential  developments  are  anticipated  on  the 
east  side.  Silverbell  Crossings  is  a  proposed  143unit  residential  subdivision,  located  just  across 
from  Neosha  Street.    Silverbell  Residential  is  an  affordable  housing  147unit  subdivision  across 
from  Goret  Road  and  the  first  phase  of  construction  is  already  underway.  Further  development  on 
the east side is limited by the Santa Cruz River and its floodplain. 

El Camino del Cerro to Sunset Road
Most  of  the  land  on  the  west  side  has  been  subdivided  into  large  residential  lots;  therefore,  growth 
in  this  area  will  be  minimal.  Land  on  the  east  side  is  mostly  vacant  and  divided  into  three  large 
parcels which are zoned as O3 Office (midrise office development) and RX1 Residence (suburban 
low  density  residential  development).  Similar  to  the  southern  section,  development  will  be  limited 
without significant mitigation to the Santa Cruz River floodplain.   

Sunset Road to Ina Road
Two  segments  of  Silverbell  Road  between  Kiley  Road  and  Ina  Road  are  located  in  Pima  County, 
while the rest is in the Town of Marana. The first segment extends from Kiley Court to just north of 
Sunset  Road  and  the  second  segment  from  just  south  of  Benjamen  Road  to  Abington  Road.  In 
general,  the  west  side  of  Silverbell  Road  has  been  almost  completely  built  out  with  low  density 
residential.  A  41unit  low  density  residential  subdivision,  named  Ina  &  Silverbell,  has  been 
approved for development just south of the Ina Road intersection. Except for a few small residential 
lots  near  Abington  Road,  the  east  side  of  Silverbell  Road  has  not  been  developed  and  is  mostly 
zoned  as  R36  which  is  the  low  density  residential  zoning  with  a  minimum  lot  size  of  ¾  acre.  The 
majority  of  the  land  here  is  owned  by  either  Pima  County  or  the  California  Portland  Cement 
Company.  Other  than  the  commercial  development  potential  at  the  corners  of  the  Silverbell/Ina 
intersection,  the  Town  of  Marana  envisions  some  industrial  development  on  the  east  side  which

again  may  be  somewhat  limited  due  to  its  close  proximity  to  the  Santa  Cruz  River  and  the  flood 
plain restrictions. 

2.3     SPEED LIMIT

        south of Grant Road; 
    ·   Ironwood Hills Drive  40 mph daytime, 35 mph nighttime; 
    ·   Grant Road  40 mph; 
    ·   Goret Road  35 mph west of Silverbell Road, 25 mph east of Silverbell Road; 
    ·   Sweetwater  45 mph west of Silverbell Road, dead end east of Silverbell Road; 
    ·   El  Camino  Del  Cerro   45  mph  west  of  Silverbell  Road,  45mph  daytime,  40  mph  nighttime 
        east of Silverbell Road; 
    ·   Sunset Road  35 mph; 
    ·   Ina Road  45 mph; 
    ·   All other side streets  25 mph.

2.4     EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

Traffic  counts  collected  from  May  19  to  May  21,  2009  include  morning  and  evening  peak  period 
turning  movement  counts  at  the  six  major  intersections    Ina  Road,  Sunset  Road,  El  Camino  Del 
Cerro,  Sweetwater  Drive,  Goret  Road  and  Grant  Road.  24hour  traffic  counts  were  collected  at 
several  locations  on  Silverbell  Road  and  on  25  side  streets.  The  detailed  count  data  are  included  in 
Appendix  C.  Additional  daily  traffic  count  data  for  the  major  cross  streets  were  obtained  from  the 
Pima  Association  of  Governments  (PAG).  PAG's  daily  traffic  counts  were  collected  between  1998 
and  2007.  These  data  were  extended  to  2009  using  estimated  growth  rates.  The  2009  daily  traffic 
volumes are summarized in Exhibits 4A and 4B. 

Intersection  capacity  analysis  was  performed  using  the  Synchro  6  traffic  analysis  software  which 
utilizes  the  current  Highway  Capacity  Manual  procedures.  The  Synchro  model  for  this  section  of 
Silverbell  Road  was  provided  by  the  City  of  Tucson.  The  existing  lane  configurations  and  the 
capacity  analysis  results  for  the  six  major  intersections  (Ina  Road,  Sunset  Road,  El  Camino  Del 
Cerro,  Sweetwater  Drive,  Goret  Road  and  Grant  Road)  are  summarized  in  Exhibit  5.  The  capacity 
analysis worksheets are provided in Appendix D. The results show that current overall intersection 
traffic operations are LOS D or better during the morning and evening peak periods. However, four 
movements operate at LOS E or F during one of the peak periods; they are the southbound leftturn 
(LOS  E)  at  the  Ina  intersection  during  the  PM  peak,  the  westbound  leftturn  (LOS  E)  at  the  El 
Camino  Del  Cerro  intersection  during  the  AM  peak,  the  eastbound  leftturn  and  northbound  left
turn (LOS F) at the Grant Road intersection during the PM peak. 

Traffic  factors  listed  in  Exhibit  3  were  calculated  from  the  24hour  roadway  counts.   The  Kfactor 
(K),  which  represents  the  percentage  of  daily  traffic  that  occurs  during  the  peak  hour  and 
directional  split  (D)  are  based  on  traffic  flow  during  both  morning  and  evening  peak  hours.  The  K 
factors  indicate  that  the  peak  traffic  periods  last  one  hour  or  so.    The  morning  and  evening  peak 
hours  occur  from  7  to  8  a.m.  and  from  5  to  6  p.m.  The  morning  peak  direction  is  southbound  while 
the  evening  peak  direction  is  northbound.  The  directional  split  during  both  peak  periods  is 
relatively high.

2.5       HEAVY VEHICLE PERCENTAGE

Twentyfour  hour  vehicle  classification  counts  were  taken  on  May  19th,  2009  between  El  Camino 
Del Cerro and Sweetwater Drive. The results of the classification studies are summarized in Exhibit 
6. In general, the observed heavy vehicle percentage is about 5%. Typical heavy vehicle percentages 
on  arterials  in  Pima  County  range  from  3%  to  5%.  FHWA  defines  heavy  vehicles  as  those  in  the 
Categories "2 Axle 6 Tire" through "> 6 Axle Multi".

2.6       SIGNAL WARRANTS

Sunset  Road  is  the  major  cross  street  with  stop  control  along  the  study  corridor.  Included  in  the 
RTA  funded  transportation  improvement  plan  is  the  extension  of  the  Sunset  Road  east  across  the 
Santa  Cruz  River  to  I10  and  to  River  Road.  Based  on  the  peakhour  volumes  taken  at  the  Sunset 
Road  intersection,  the  highest,  4th  highest,  and  8th  highest  eastbound  volumes  were  82  veh/h,  66 
veh/h,  and  49  veh/h,  respectively.  To  meet  MUTCD  Signal  Warrant  1  (EightHour  Vehicular 
Volume),  the  8th  highest  side  street  volume  needs  to  exceed  75  veh/h.  To  meet  Warrant  2  (Four
Hour  Vehicular  Volume),  the  4th  highest  side  street  volume  would  need  to  exceed  80  veh/h.  As 
such, a signal control is not currently warranted at this intersection. 

Hourly volumes were collected at all stop controlled minor side streets. Silverbell Tree Drive east of 
Silverbell  Road  has  the  highest  daily  volume  among  these  side  streets.  The  three  highest  volumes 
on  Silverbell  Tree  Drive  entering  Silverbell  Road  were  88  veh/hr,  61  veh/hr  and  58  veh/hr.  These 
volumes  are  lower  than  the  threshold  volumes  for  the  MUTCD  warrants;  therefore,  no  signals  are 
currently warranted at any of the minor side streets. 


2.7       CRASH HISTORY

Crash  data  for  Silverbell  Road  from  Ina  Road  to  Grant  Road  was  provided  by  the  Tucson  Police 
Department, Town of Marana Police Department, and Pima County Department of Transportation, 
for  the  3year  period  from  January  1,  2006  to  December  31,  2008.  Crash  data  for  each  roadway 
segment and intersection were reviewed and are summarized in Exhibit 7A, 7B, 7C, 8A and 8B.  

At Ina Road, Sunset Road, Sweetwater Drive and Goret Road, the crash rates are low relative to the 
average  crash  rate  of  0.99  for  signalized  intersections  within  Pima  County  for  the  period  from 
January  2005  to  December  2007.  The  most  frequent  intersection  crash  types  are  rearend  and 
turning,  which  is  typical  for  a  high  speed  twolane  roadway.  At  Sweetwater  Drive,  5  of  the  6  rear
end  crashes  occurred  on  the  southbound  approach.  At  El  Camino  Del  Cerro  the  typical  crash  types 
are  turning  and  rear  end  and  the  crash  rate  is  1.33.  Police  reports  indicate  that  most  of  the  turning 
crashes  at  this  intersection  were  caused  by  leftturners  failing  to  yield  to  through  traffic.  Adding 
protected  left turn  phasing  on  Silverbell  Road  at  El  Camino  Del  Cerro  should  be  considered  and 
Project 9589.0                                                                                               10

may  reduce  the  frequency  of  this  type  of  crash.  Grant  Road  intersection  had  the  highest  number  of 
crashes  and  a  crash  rate  of  1.18.   Twentytwo  of  the  59  crashes  were  turning  crashes.  On  the  west 
leg of the Grant Road intersection, 7 of the 8 crashes are driveway related angle crashes. On the east 
leg,  15  of  the  24  crashes  are  driveway  related  turning/angle  crashes.  Installing  a  raised  median  on 
Grant Road to prohibit the outbound leftturn movement from the nearby driveways would reduce 
the frequency of driveway related crashes. 

The  crash  rate  for  each  roadway  segment,  with  the  exception  of  segment  between  Goret  Road  and 
Grant  Road,  is  below  the  average  crash  rate  of  1.31  for  roadway  segments  within  Pima  County  for 
the  period  January  2005  to  December  2007  [2].  On  the  segment  between  Goret  Road  and  Grant 
Road,  the  crash  rate  is  slightly  higher  than  the  regional  average.  No  crashes  were  reported  for  the 
segment  from  Sunset  Road  to  El  Camino  Del  Cerro  during  the  3year  analysis  period.  Between 
Sweetwater  Drive  and  Goret  Road,  9  of  the  16  crashes,  including  a  fatality  occurred  at  the  Neosha 
Street  intersection.  The  fatal  headon  crash  was  the  result  of  a  southbound  vehicle  losing  control 
and  hitting  a  northbound  vehicle.  Between  Goret  Road  and  Grant  Road,  13  of  33  crashes  occurred 
within  the  northbound  lane  drop  area  that  overlaps  with  the  shopping  center  driveways.  One 
bicycle  related  crash  occurred  at  the  Grant  Road  intersection  which  was  the  result  of  a  northbound 
rightturning vehicle failing to yield to a northbound through bicycle.

2.8      ALTERNATIVE MODES  


Transit
Route 21 (West Congress/Silverbell) currently provides weekday and weekend service on Silverbell 
Road between St. Mary's Road and Goret Road.   There are five bus stops between Grant Road and 
Goret  Road.    Bus  headways  range  from  30  minutes  during  the  daytime  to  60  minutes  in  the 
evening.  Currently,  Sun  Tran  does  not  have  any  plans  to  expand  transit  service  along  Silverbell 
Road.   In  addition  to  Sun  Tran  buses,  school  buses  also  frequently  use  Silverbell  Road  during  the 
morning  and  afternoon  pickup  hours.  The  following  schools  have  bus  pickup  locations  along  the 
study  corridor:  Borton  Elementary  School,  Robins  Elementary  School,  BoothFickett  Math/Science 
Magnet Middle School, Mansfeld Middle School, Maxwell Middle School, Palo Verde High Magnet 
School,  and  Tucson  High  School.  The  pickup  locations  along  Silverbell  Road  are  at  Painted  Sunset 
Circle,  Xochipilli  Drive,  Hills  of  Gold  Drive,  Silverbell  Arrow  Drive,  Burlwood  Way,  Prichett  Place, 
and Neosha Street. 

Bicycles
Silverbell  Road,  between  Grant  Road  and  Sunset  Road  and  from  Abington  Road  to  Ina  Road  (3/4 
mile)  is  designated  as  a  bike  route  with  striped  shoulders.   The  shoulder  width  varies  from  46  feet 
in  these  sections.   The  rest  of  the  corridor,  from  Sunset  Road  to  Abington  Road,  is  not  designated 
for  bicycle  use  as  the  paved  shoulder  widths  are  only  one  foot.   Still,  the  Silverbell  Road  corridor  is 
a favorite for bicycle enthusiasts. 

Pedestrians
Pedestrian facilities in the project area are limited primarily to unpaved, and in some segments, un
graded  shoulders.    Sidewalk  does  exist  within  the  vicinity  of  the  commercial  properties  at  Grant 
Road.  Cross  walks  are  provided  only  at  the  signalized  intersection.  Due  to  the  lack  of  pedestrian 
facilities,  as  well  as  the  relatively  low  density  of  both  residential  and  commercial  development, 
pedestrian  demand  within  the  corridor  is  very  low.    Implementation  of  bicycle/pedestrian  paths 
along  both  banks  of  the  Santa  Cruz  River  as  part  of  the  Pima  County  river  park  system  is  planned.  
The path along the west side of the river will be the officially designated De Anza Trail. 

Trails
A  number  of  unimproved  equestrian/hiking  trails  are  located  within  the  roadway  corridor  and  are 
illustrated  in  Exhibit  9.   These  include  the  shoulders  of  Silverbell  Road  itself,  the  Santa  Cruz  River, 
and  several  of  the  larger  washes.   Equestrian  activity  within  the  corridor  primarily  occurs  west  of 
Silverbell  Road  and  within  the  Santa  Cruz  River.    Due  to  limited  shoulders,  activity  immediately 
adjacent  to  Silverbell  Road  is  very  limited.    Crossing  of  Silverbell  Road  to  get  to  the  Santa  Cruz 
River is a more frequent occurrence.

2.9     LIGHTING AND ITS

Current roadway lighting is limited to each of the signalized intersections and several unsignalized 
intersections  (Avenida  Alber,  Christopher  Columbus  Park  entrance,  and  Sunset  Road).    South  of 
Grant  Road,  continuous  roadway  lighting  is  provided  on  Silverbell  Road.  The  Town  of  Marana 
outdoor  lighting  code  designates  Silverbell  Road  as  rural  with  lighting  levels  appropriate  for 
residential  or  agricultural  land  uses.   That  portion  of  corridor  within  Pima  County  and  the  City  of 
Tucson  is  designated  an  urban  lighting  area  in  which  lighting  levels  associated  with  commercial 
and industrial activity, apartments, and suburban residential developments are allowed. 

Each  of  the  three  jurisdictions  follows  different  practices  for  the  installation  of  continuous  roadway 
lighting.    The  Town  of  Marana  typically  does  not  install  continuous  roadway  lighting,  but  only 
lights signalized intersections. Pima County only installs continuous roadway lighting in areas with 
a  relatively  high  density  of  access  points  and/or  heavy  vehicular  access  activity,  heavy  pedestrian 
activity,  or  where  there  is  a  history  of  nighttime  crashes  that  may  be  mitigated  with  roadway 
lighting.  While  Pima  County  does  not  typically  install  continuous  lighting  on  arterial  roadways, 
lighting  is  often  installed  at  highervolume  unsignalized  intersections  (side  streets  or  driveways).  
Originally implemented in the late 1970's, the City of Tucson has a formal program to evaluate and 
prioritize  roadway  lighting  needs.    Over  the  last  30  years,  the  City  has  upgraded  and  expanded 
their  roadway  lighting  system  in  order  to  improve  public  safety.    The  Tucson  Comprehensive 
Roadway  Illumination  Study,  which  was  last  updated  in  2003,  recommends  a  program  to  add 
roadway  lighting  to  84  miles  of  arterials  within  the  City  over  a  10year  period.    The  program 
includes  the  section  of  Silverbell  Road  from  Grant  Road  to  the  city  limits  north  of  El  Camino  del 
Cerro.  Inclusion  of  this  section  of  Silverbell  Road  in  the  current  arterial  lighting  program  was 
significantly  influenced  by  the  presence  of  deficient  roadway  geometry.   Lighting  along  El  Camino 
del Cerro between I10 and Silverbell Road is also planned. 

The City of Tucson has fiber optic cable attached to the TEP poles running between Grant Road and 
Sweetwater  Drive.    While  there  are  no  specific  plans  to  extend  agency  owned  fiber  optic  cable 
within the corridor, City Communications has noted that it is desirable to link the City system with 
Marana.    City  of  Tucson  Traffic  Engineering  utilizes  this  fiber  optic  communications  network  to 
link  its  signals  as  well  as  the  recently  installed  mesh  radio  system  to  the  regional  traffic  signal 
operations  center.   Pima  County  and  the  Town  of  Marana  routinely  install  fiber  optic  cable,  or  at  a 
minimum the conduit and pull boxes, as part of their roadway CIP projects.

3.       Future Conditions
Traffic  demand  on  Silverbell  Road  will  grow  as  development  occurs  within  the  corridor  between    
I10  and  the  Tucson  Mountains  and  in  the  Town  of  Marana.  The  regional  transportation 
improvement  plan  developed  by  the  RTA  and  approved  by  voters  includes  the  widening  of  the  8
mile section of Silverbell Road from Ina Road to Grant Road to a 3 or 4-lane divided desert parkway 
to add capacity and improve safety.  Other planned improvements in the vicinity of Silverbell Road 
include extending Twin Peaks Road from Silverbell Road to I10 in Marana, extending Sunset Road 
from  Silverbell  Road  to  I10  and  River  Road,  and  grade  separating  the  railroad  crossings  at  Ina 
Road  and  Ruthrauff  Road.    Each  of  these  improvements  is  included  in  the  PAG  regional  traffic 
forecasting model, as well as the recently completed widening of I10. 


3.1      TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

Future  30year  traffic  demands  were  developed  utilizing  2040  projections  produced  by  the  current 
Pima Association of Governments (PAG) regional traffic forecasting model. Traffic projections were 
prepared for three scenarios of the Sunset Road extension, 

     ·   Scenario 1  Sunset Road extension not in place; 
     ·   Scenario 2  Sunset Road extension to I10 only; 
     ·   Scenario 3  Sunset Road extension to River Road. 
The 2040 traffic projections are presented in Exhibits 10A, 10B, and 10C and are summarized below. 

     ·   The  extension  of  Sunset  Road  is  projected  to  carry  17,000  vpd.   The  Sunset  Road  connection 
         will  not  generate  new  trips  on  Silverbell  Road,  but  will  reroute  trips  that  use  Grant  Road, 
         Ina Road, and El Camino del Cerro to cross the Santa Cruz River. 

     ·   Traffic demand on Silverbell Road north of Sunset Road is expected to grow from 7,500 vpd 
         to  some  22,000  vpd  (nearly  200%  growth)  over  the  next  30  years.  Much  of  this  growth  will 
         be  generated  by  development  in  Marana,  although  significant  growth  is  projected  west  of 
         Silverbell  Road  in  the  vicinity  of  Sunset  Road.    While  development  along  Silverbell  Road 
         will  be  limited,  it  will  also  contribute  to  overall  corridor  traffic  growth.  Traffic  between 
         Sunset Road and El Camino del Cerro is projected to more than double (120% growth) while 
         lesser  growth  (6080%)  is  expected  to  occur  between  El  Camino  del  Cerro  and  Grant  Road. 
         PAG's  predicted  negative  growth  south  of  Grant  Road  was  adjusted  to  reflect  a  small 
         amount of growth (13%) over the 30 year period. 

     ·   Traffic  growth  on  Ina  Road  west  of  Silverbell  Road  is  projected  to  be  relatively  low  (5%) 
         when  compared  to  Silverbell  Road.    This  small  amount  of  growth  is  influenced  by  the 
         zoning along Ina Road that only allows for low density residential development.

Silverbell Road ­ Ina Road to Grant Road                                                               November 2009



    ·   On  Sunset  Road,  PAG  predicts  high  traffic  growth  (300%)  generated  by  future  residential 
        development west of Silverbell Road. Still, future traffic volumes on Sunset Road to the west 
        are projected to reach only approximately 5,000 vpd. 

    ·    On  El  Camino  Del  Cerro,  PAG  predicts  low  growth  to  the west  of  Silverbell  Road,  which  is  
        reasonable  considering  that  zoning  along  El  Camino  Del  Cerro  allows  for  only  low  density 
        residential  development  and  most  of  the  surrounding  area  is  already  built  out.  On  Grant 
        Road,  PAG  predicts  moderate  growth  to  the  west  of  Silverbell  Road  (2%)  and  almost  no 
        growth  to  the  east  of  Silverbell  Road.  This  is  due  to  the  moderate  population  growth  of  the 
        surrounding area and the widened I10 which will attract traffic from Silverbell Road. 

    ·   Goret  Road,  west  of  Silverbell  Road,  is  also  projected  to  have  high  traffic  growth  (230%) 
        with  volumes  reaching  some  6,700  vpd.  PAG's  current  traffic  forecasting  model  does  not 
        include  Goret  Road  east  of  Silverbell  Road,  however,  based  on  current  development  plans, 
        145  single  family  houses  will  be  built  in  this  area.  This  planned  development  could 
        ultimately  generate  as  many  as  1,400  daily  trips  based  on  a  typical  residential  trip  rate  of  10 
        trip ends/day (ITE Trip Generation Manual). 

Using  existing  traffic  factors  and  turning  movement  counts,  as  well  as  projected  turning 
percentages  produced  by  PAG,  2040  peak  period  turning  volumes  were  developed  and  used  in  the 
analysis  of  intersection  capacity  requirements.  These  turning  volumes  are  included  with  the 
intersection  analysis  results  in  Exhibits  13A,  13B,  and  13C,  respectively.  Worksheets  used  to 
develop the future turning movement volumes are provided in Appendix E.

3.2     SIGNAL WARRANTS

For  Scenario  1,  no  Sunset  Road  extension  on  the  east  side  of  Silverbell  Road,  the  Signal  Warrant  1 
and  2  are  met  at  the  Sunset  Road  intersection  using  the  projected  2040  peakhour  turning  volumes. 
It  is  recommended  that  conduit  and  pullbox  be  installed  at  this  intersection.  If  Sunset  Road  is  not 
extended  to  I10  as  planned,  Pima  County  transportation  engineering  staff  should  monitor  the 
future  traffic  demand  and  safety  at this  intersection  and  install  the  signal  control  when needed.  For 
the  other  two  scenarios,  the  projected  2040  daily  traffic  on  Sunset  Road  east  of  Silverbell  Road  will 
be  over  17,000.  Therefore,  the  signal  control  is  required  to  accommodate  the  traffic  demand  at  this 
intersection. The warrant analysis for the Scenarios 1 is provided in Appendix F.

3.3     CAPACITY AND LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS


3.3.1 Methodology
Future  intersection  and  roadway  lane  requirements  were  determined  based  on  the  results  of 
capacity  and  level  of  service  analysis  of  the  2040  traffic  forecasts.  All  three  scenarios  related  to  the 
Sunset  Road  extension  were  evaluated  using  Synchro.  The  following  criteria  were  assumed  for  the 
intersection capacity and level of service analysis. 

    ·   Percentages  of  heavy  vehicles  are  the  same  as  existing  conditions  if  greater  than  2%, 
        otherwise 2%. 
    ·   Peakhour factors are the same as existing if lower than 0.92, otherwise 0.92.  
    ·   4phase signal operation with permitted/protected leftturn phasing, if needed. 
    ·   Cycle lengths are optimized to minimize intersection delay. 
    ·   Rightturns on red are permitted. 
    ·   Clearance interval (all red plus yellow) settings are the same as existing settings. 
    ·   Considering  the  wide  signal  spacing,  Arrival  Type  3,  representing  random  arrivals,  was 
        assumed. 
Intersection  capacity  analysis  worksheets  are  provided  in  Appendix  G.  The  intersection  level  of 
service  analysis  results  of  the  three  scenarios  are  summarized  in  Exhibits  11A,  11B,  and  11C, 
respectively. The intersection level of service analysis results and the required lane configuration to 
provide LOS D or better are summarized in Exhibits 13A, 13B, and 13C. 

3.3.2 Level of Service
Level  of  Service  (LOS)  is  a  qualitative  measure  used  to  describe  how  a  roadway  facility  (an 
intersection or roadway section), operates under a given set of conditions. These conditions include, 
but are not limited to, vehicle and pedestrian volumes, number and width of lanes, grade, available 
shoulder  and  median  widths,  and  the  type  of  traffic  control  (traffic  signal,  stop  sign,  etc.)  that  is 
present.  Six  levels  of  service  (LOS  A  through  F)  are  defined  by  a  traffic  flow  measure  that  is 
considered  a  primary  indicator  of  how  each  facility  type  is  operating.  For  signalized  and 
unsignalized intersections, this measure is the average time (seconds) that vehicles are delayed (not 
running  at  normal  operating  speed)  at  the  intersection.  For  arterials,  the  measure  is  the  average 
travel speed of vehicles. 

Considering  that  this  section  of  Silverbell  Road  will  have  limited  access  with  a  relatively  low 
frequency of driveways and side streets compared to a more commercialized arterial, such as Grant 
Road  or  Speedway  Boulevard,  the  overall  roadway  level  of  service  will  be  controlled  by  the 
operation of the signalized intersections. The LOS gradient for a signalized intersection is described 
as follows:

LOS Criteria

City  of  Tucson,  Pima  County,  and  Town  of  Marana  roadway  design  guidelines  require  that 
improvements shall provide sufficient capacity so that roadway segments and intersections operate 
at LOS D or better based on the projected future traffic demand. 

3.3.3 Roadway Segment Capacity
General  roadway  capacity  requirements  for  Silverbell  Road  can  be  estimated  using  planning  level 
roadway  capacity  thresholds  adopted  by  PAG.  PAG  sets  the  capacities  for  2  and  4lane  roadways 
at  21,400  and  43,000  vehicles  per  day  (vpd).  At  a  planning  level,  roadway  lane  requirements  are 
typically determined based on 80% of the roadway capacity, which essentially reflects LOS D traffic 
operations.  Applied  to  the  PAG  capacities,  2  and  4lane  roadways  can  carry  approximately  17,100 
and  34,400  vpd,  respectively,  at  LOS  D.  Using  these  criteria,  four  through  lanes  on  Silverbell  Road 
will be required and to serve traffic demands projected for 2040 and beyond. 

The  RTA's  transportation  plan  lists  either  a  3lane  or  4lane  options  for  the  Silverbell  Road  section 
from El Camino Del Cerro to Ina Road. A 4lane cross section is preferred for several reasons. 

    ·   The 2040 traffic projections on the section between El Camino Del Cerro and Ina Road range 
        from 21,000 to 23,000 vpd. This demand level would result in LOS E or F on a 3lane facility.  
    ·   The  intersection  capacity  analysis  indicated  that  two  through  lanes  in  each  direction  would 
        be  required  at  the  Ina  Road,  Sunset  Road,  and  El  Camino  Del  Cerro  intersections.  This  is 
        essentially a 4lane cross section. 
    ·   A  3lane  cross  section  would  also  likely  require  deceleration  lanes  for  rightturn  traffic  at 
        most  side  streets  considering  the  high  speed  design  on  Silverbell  Road.  This  is  essentially  a 
        4lane cross section. 
    ·   The  additional  capacity  provided  by  4lane  cross  section  will  allow  for  easier  and  safer 
        access onto Silverbell Road from side streets and driveways. 
    ·   Frequent  transitions  from  a  3lane  roadway  to  a  3lane  plus  deceleration  lanes  or  a  4lane 
        cross  section  at  signalized  intersections  would  result  in  a  nonuniform  roadway  and  would 
        impact traffic flow.

3.3.4 Intersection Capacity
The  results  of  the  intersection  capacity  analyses  indicate  that  with  the  provision  of  sufficient  turn 
lane  capacity,  a  4lane  cross  section will  provide  satisfactory  (LOS  D  or better)  traffic  operations  for 
projected  2040  traffic  demand.  The  average  delays  for  each  intersection  approach  and  for  the  entire 
intersection  generally  fall  within  the  range  of  delay  used  to  define  LOS  A  to  C  with  some 
exceptions.  This  indicates  that  the  intersection  configurations  provided  in  Exhibit  13A,  13B,  and 
13C will provide some excess capacity to serve additional traffic demand beyond that predicted for 
2040.  The  traffic  analysis  results  indicate  that  dual  westbound  leftturn  lanes  are  required  at  the  El 
Camino  Del  Cerro  intersection  if  Sunset  Road  is  not  extended  (Scenario  1).  Dual  northbound  and 
southbound leftturn lanes will be required at Grant Road for all three scenarios. The intersection at 
Ina Road was recently reconstructed and opened in March 2009. The current lane configuration can 
accommodate the predicted 2040 traffic demand for all three scenarios.

4.      Proposed Improvements 

Proposed  roadway  improvements  are  based  on  the  results  of  analysis  of  existing  and  future  traffic 
operations,  analysis  of  crash  data,  and  roadway  design  guidelines  from  the  City  of  Tucson,  Pima 
County,  and  the  Town  of  Marana.  The  following  proposed roadway  improvements are  intended  to 
provide  the  necessary  capacity,  roadway  geometry,  and  multimodal  facilities  to  provide  a  high 
level  of  traffic  operations  and  safety  to  serve  existing  and  future  traffic  demand  that  is  expected  to 
increase by 100% or more over the next 20 to 30 years.  

4.1     DESIGN PARAMETERS

The following roadway design criteria are recommended for this project: 

Design  Speed  ­  The  existing  posted  speed  limit  is  45  mph  between  Ina  Road  and  Goret  Road,  40 
mph between Goret Road and Grant Road. A design speed of 50 mph is recommended between Ina 
Road  and  Goret  Road  and  a  design  speed  of  45  mph  is  recommended  between  Goret  Road  and 
Grant  Road.  The  posted  speed  limit  is  recommended  to  be  45  mph  between  Ina  Road  and  Goret 
Road,  and  40  mph  between  Goret  Road  and  Grant  Road.  The  posted  speed  of  40  mph  in  the 
southern  segment  is  consistent  with  the  current  land  use  and  with  the  posted  speed  for  the 
Silverbell Road section south of Grant Road. 

Stopping  Sight  Distance  ­  Stopping  sight  distance  should  be  a  minimum  of  425  feet  for  a  design 
speed  of  50  mph  based  on  the  design  criteria  provided  in  the  2004  AASHTO  Policy  on  Geometric 
Design of Highways and Streets [10]. 

Clear  Zone  ­  Clear  zone  should  be  a  minimum  of  20  feet  based  on  the  criteria  for  a  50  mph  design 
speed provided in the 2004 update of the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide [11]. 

Median  ­  Considering  the  design  speed,  future  traffic  demand,  and  access  control  requirements,  a 
raised median is preferred over a flush median.   

Median  and  Lane  Widths  ­  Considering  that  Silverbell  Road  is  designated  as  a  scenic  route,  in 
order to minimize the overall roadway cross section, the minimum median and lane widths defined 
by  Pima  County  for  environmentally  sensitive  roadways  are  preferred  over  the  standard  City  of 
Tucson,  Pima  County,  and  Town  of  Marana  widths.    These  include  a  20foot  median,  a  12foot 
inside  travel  lane,  an  11foot  outside  travel  lane,  and  a  minimum  paved  shoulder  of  5feet  not 
including a gutter pan. 

Design  Vehicle  ­  Considering  the  functional  classification  of  Silverbell  Road  as  a  principal  arterial, 
the  roadway  should  be  designed  to  accommodate  a  WB50  semitrailer  combination  at  a  minimum 
with  a  WB67  vehicle  preferred.  The  design  of  median  openings  will  use  an  appropriate  design 
vehicle  to  accommodate  Uturns  by  passenger  cars  as  well  as  passenger  vehicles  pulling  horse 
trailers.

4.2     ROADWAY CROSS SECTION

The  analysis  of  future  traffic  demands  indicates  that  a  4lane  divided  section  with  bicycle  and 
pedestrian  facilities  will  provide  sufficient  roadway  capacity  to  serve  projected  corridor  traffic  in 
2040.  A recommended typical cross section is provided in Exhibit 12. 

4.3     INTERSECTIONS

Based  on  the  capacity  analysis  results,  the  intersection  lane  configurations  provided  in  Exhibits 
13A, 13B, 13C are required.  

4.4     MEDIAN OPENINGS AND ACCESS

AASHTO  [10]  considers  a  divided  roadway  with  a  raised  median  the  preferred  cross  section  for 
arterials  with  a  design  speed  of  45  mph  or  greater,  particularly  with  high  volumes  of  through 
traffic.  Several  of  the  more  important  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  a  raised  median  on  an 
arterial include: 

    ·   Discourages strip development and encourages large planned development. 
    ·   Reduces midblock crashes. 
    ·   Reduces vehicle conflicts at driveways. 
    ·   Reduces crash severity. 
    ·   Increases Uturn volume at median openings and intersections. 
    ·   Can reduce leftturn capacity at a signalized intersection. 
    ·   Restricts direct access to adjoining properties. 
Considering  that  Silverbell  Road  will  function  as  a  principal  arterial  roadway,  and  as  such  the 
roadway  design  must  provide  a  high  level  of  traffic  safety  and  operations,  a  raised  median  is 
appropriate.  

Currently  there  are  5  signalized  intersections,  1  major  cross  street,  25  minor  cross  streets,  53 
residential  driveways,  and  14  existing  commercial  driveways  along  Silverbell  Road  between  Ina 
Road and Grant Road. Additional access points will also be required to serve future residential and 
commercial  development  within  the  corridor.  The  City  of  Tucson  Transportation  Access 
Management  Guidelines  and  the  Pima  County  Roadway  Design  Guidelines  recommend  that 
median  openings  should  be  spaced  no  closer  than  660  feet  on  a  suburban  arterial  and  ¼  mile  is 
preferred.    Providing  median  openings  within  the  functional  limits  of  a  signalized  intersection  is 
highly discouraged.  

The  spacing  of  traffic  signals  is  dependent  upon  a  number  of  factors,  however,  ½  mile  is  generally 
the accepted minimum for a principal arterial.  

Project 9589.0                                                                                          32
Silverbell Road ­ Ina Road to Grant Road                                                             November 2009



There  are  90  minor  cross  streets  and  driveways  within  the  study  section.  The  need  to  maintain 
access  must  be  balanced  with  the  operational  and  safety  requirements  required  for  a  principal 
arterial.  

A  proposed  access  plan,  illustrated  in  Exhibits  14A,  14B,  14C,  14D,  and  14E,  minimizes  the  number 
of  median  openings  while  providing  as  much  direct  access  to  adjacent  properties  as  possible  while 
considering  the  median  opening  criteria  specified  by  each  agency  for  an  arterial  roadway.   Where 
access is restricted to rightin/rightout only, frequently spaced Uturn opportunities will need to be 
provided.  The proposed plan includes the access requirement for future developments (Driveways 
4,  75  and  78),  and  also  recommends  that  at  several  locations  driveways  serving  adjacent  individual 
residences  be  combined.    These  locations  include:  driveways  18  and  19,  driveways  21  and  88,  
driveways  30,  85  and  86,  driveways  40  and  41,  driveways  43  and  44,  driveways  54  and  70.  It  is  also 
recommended  that  driveways  34  and  35  be  removed  because  they  are  located  too  close  to  the  El 
Camino Del Cerro/Silverbell Road intersection.

4.4     RIGHT-TURN DECELERATION LANES


Signalized Intersections

Exclusive  rightturn  lane  requirements  at  signalized  intersections  were  determined  based  on  the 
capacity  and  level  of  service  analysis.    As  shown  in  Exhibits  13A,  13B,  and  13C,  northbound  and 
southbound  rightturn  lanes  will  be  required  at  all  existing  signalized  intersections  as  well  as  at 
Sunset  Road  which  will  be  signalized.  Eastbound  and  westbound  rightturn  lanes  are 
recommended  at  Sunset  Road,  El  Camino  del  Cerro,  and  Grant  Road.    No  additional  exclusive 
rightturn lanes are required at the recently reconstructed intersection at Ina Road. 

Unsignalized Intersections

Exclusive  rightturn  deceleration  lane  requirements  at  unsignalized  intersections  (side  streets  and 
driveways)  were  evaluated  using  the  methodology  described  in  NCHRP  Report  457,  Evaluating 
Intersection  Improvements:  An  Engineering  Study  Guide  [12].    This  methodology  considers  the 
rightturn  volume,  mainline  volume,  number  of  mainline  lanes, and  speed  in  determining  the need 
for  a  deceleration  lane.   The  methodology  is  provided  in  Exhibit  15.   Only  those  side  streets  with 
daily  traffic  volumes  exceeding  100  were  evaluated.  Peakhour  rightturn  volumes  were  estimated 
based  on  the  potential  presence  of  a  future  median  opening.    Where  median  openings  are 
recommended,  the  rightturn  volume  was  assumed  to  be  onehalf  of  the  total  inbound  volume.  
Where  a  median  opening  is  not  expected  to  be  provided,  all  inbound  traffic  are  right  turns.    The 
evaluation  assumed  a  speed  limit  of  45  mph  from  Ina  Road  to  Goret  Road  and  a  speed  limit  of  40 
mph from Goret Road to Grant Road.  

The  evaluation  results,  summarized  in  Exhibit  16,  indicate  that  rightturn  deceleration  lanes  should 
be  considered  at  six  locations,  all  of  which  are  located  between  Goret  Road  and  Grant  Road.   Note 
that  at  each  of  these  six  locations,  the  estimated  rightturn  volumes  only  slightly  exceed  the  turn 
lane  threshold.    At  none  of  the  locations  evaluated  is  a  deceleration  lane  clearly  warranted.  
Provision  of  a  deceleration  lane  at  Christopher  Columbus  Park  should  be  considered  since  heavy 
traffic does occur during special events throughout the year.

4.5     TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANTS

Although  a  signal  is  not  currently  warranted,  expected  traffic  growth  on  both  Silverbell  Road  and 
Sunset  Road  will  justify  the  installation  of  a  signal  at  that  location.  Signal  warrant  worksheets  for 
projected  2040  traffic  demands  are  provided  in  Appendix  F.   Since  a  signal  at  this  intersection  may 
be warranted before either the planned widening of Silverbell Road or the extension of Sunset Road 
occurs,  traffic  conditions  at  this  location  should  be  monitored  annually.   Currently,  there  does  not 
appear  to  be  a  need  for  pedestrian  signals,  however,  midblock  HAWK  signals  should  be 
considered  when  warranted.    The  need  for  a  HAWK  signal  at  Introspect  Drive  where  a  charter 
school  is  located  should  be  evaluated  during  the  design  phase  of  the  Silverbell  Road  widening 
project.  City  of  Tucson  criteria  for  the  installation  of  HAWK  signals  is  included  in  the  City  of 
Tucson Transportation Access Management Guidelines and are included in Appendix H. 


4.6     QUEUING ANALYSIS

A  queuing  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  turnlane  storage  requirements  at  signalized 
intersections  based  on  projected  2040  traffic  demands.  The recommended  storage  lengths  represent 
the  95th  percentile  queue  lengths  generated  by  the  Synchro  model  and  the  minimum  requirements 
per  Pima  County,  City  of  Tucson  and  Town  of  Marana  design  guidelines.  The  speed  limit  of  the 
proposed  Sunset  Road  extension  is  assumed  to  be  35  mph.  The  recommended  minimum  storage 
lengths  are  provided  in  Exhibit  17A,  17B,  and  17C.    At  unsignalized  intersections,  the  minimum 
turn  lane  storage  length  should  be  150  feet.    Detailed  queuing  information  on  which  the  storage 
recommendations are based are provided in Appendix I.

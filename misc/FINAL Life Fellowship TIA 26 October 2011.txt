1.0      Executive Summary

The purpose of the traffic impact analysis is to review vehicular traffic impacts as a result of the
proposed Life Fellowship Church development. The objectives of this study are:

         To estimate trip generation and distribution for the proposed development and future
         approved developments.
         To perform intersection capacity analyses for the identified study area.
         To determine the potential traffic impacts of the proposed development.
         To develop recommendations for needed roadway and operational improvements to
         accommodate the proposed development's traffic impacts.

The proposed Life Fellowship Church development is located in Cornelius, North Carolina west
of the I-77 Service Road and south of Chartwell Center Drive. As currently envisioned, the
proposed development will ultimately consist of the following land uses and intensities:

         1,000 seat church
         200 student daycare

It should be noted that Life Fellowship Church has stated that the development will be built out in
phases. However, due to the variable development plans of a church and the relatively low trip
generation, this study analyzes the planned build of the church consisting of 43,000 sf by 2018
and the possible full build-out of the church consisting of 100,000 sf by 2018. The full build-out
analysis (100,000 sf) can be found in the Appendix. The proposed development will be accessed
via two proposed full-movement driveways along I-77 Service Road. Access to the site does not
change between planned and full build-out by 2018

This report summarizes the analyses of 2011 existing conditions, 2018 background conditions
(without the proposed development), and 2018 build-out conditions during the AM and PM peak
hours at the following existing intersections:

         W. Catawba Avenue at Liverpool Parkway/Torrence Chapel Road
         Liverpool Parkway at Chartwell Center Drive

This report summarizes the analyses of 2018 build-out conditions during the AM and PM peak
hours at the following proposed intersections:

         I-77 Service Road at Site Drive 1
         I-77 Service Road at Site Drive 2

Throughout this study Site Drive 1 is assumed to be the northern driveway, while Site Drive 2 is
assumed to be the southern driveway.

Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. was retained to determine the potential traffic impacts of this
development in accordance with the traffic study guidelines in the NCDOT Policy on Street and
Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways and the transportation improvements that may be
required to accommodate these impacts. This report presents trip generation, distribution,
capacity analyses, and recommendations for transportation improvements required to meet
anticipated traffic demands.

Based on the capacity analyses conducted, there are no transportation improvements
recommended at the study intersections.

              4.0        Traffic Generation

              The traffic generation potential of the proposed development was determined using the trip
              generation rates published in Trip Generation (Institute of Transportation Engineers, Eighth
              Edition, 2008) for all land uses. Given the variable development patterns of a church, both the
              planned 43,000 sf build and the full build-out of 100,000 sf have been analyzed. The proposed
              development will consist of the following land uses and intensities upon planned build in 2018:

                         43,000 square foot church
                         200 student daycare

              Table 4.0 summarizes the estimated traffic generation for the planned 2018 build of the church at
              43,000 sf and a 200 student preschool. As shown, the proposed development has the potential to
              generate 175 and 158 net new external trips during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively,
              during a typical weekday at total project build-out.

5.0      Site Traffic Distribution

The proposed development's trips were assigned to the surrounding roadway network. The
directional distribution and assignment was based on existing peak hour turning movements,
existing land uses, and population densities in the area:

      35% to/from the east on West Catawba Avenue
      25% to/from the west on West Catawba Avenue
      20% to/from the north on Torrence Chapel Road
      20% to/from the south on Liverpool Pkwy

The site traffic distribution is shown in Figure 5.1.

           6.1            2011 Existing Traffic
           Peak-hour intersection turning-movement and heavy vehicle counts were performed by Quality
           Counts, LLC from 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM and from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM on Wednesday, October
           12, 2011, at the following intersections:

                          W. Catawba Avenue at Liverpool Parkway/Torrence Chapel Road
                          Liverpool Parkway at Chartwell Center Drive

           To develop existing traffic volumes along I-77 Service Road, which the Life Fellowship Church
           is proposed to access, trips were generated for a 45,300 square-foot autobody collision center and
           distributed northbound and southbound past the future site appropriately. South of the site, I-77
           Service Road ends into a cul-de-sac and only serves an existing Wilburn Autobody Collision
           Center. The traffic to and from this facility would be the only traffic to bypass the church site.
           Table 6.0 summarizes the estimated traffic generation for the existing collision center.

Note: Trip generation was calculated using the following data:
AM Peak-Hour Traffic Generation

   Wilburn Autobody Collision Center (Existing)                                      [ITE 942]     =    T = 2.94(X); (65% in, 35% out)

PM Peak-Hour Traffic Generation
   Wilburn Autobody Collision Center (Existing)                                      [ITE 942]     =    Ln(T) = 0.94 Ln(X) +1.33; (50% in, 50% out)




           The turning-movement count data are included in the Appendix. Figure 6.1 shows the 2011
           existing AM and PM peak-hour traffic volumes.

           6.2            Historical Growth Traffic
           Historical growth traffic is the increase in existing traffic volumes due to usage increases and
           non-specific growth throughout the area. Based on direction from NCDOT, an annual growth
           rate of 2.0 percent was applied to the existing traffic for seven years to calculate base 2018
           background traffic volumes. The existing traffic along I-77 Service Road generated from the
           collision center was not grown.

6.3      2018 Background Traffic
The 2018 background traffic volumes include existing and historical growth traffic. The 2018
AM and PM peak-hour background traffic volumes are shown in Figure 6.2.

6.4      Site Traffic
The proposed site traffic was generated, distributed, and assigned to the adjacent roadway
network as discussed previously in Sections 4.0 and 5.0.

6.5      2018 Build-out Traffic
Total 2018 build-out traffic volumes include the 2018 background traffic and the proposed site
traffic. The 2018 AM and PM peak-hour build traffic volumes for a 43,000 sf church are shown
in Figure 6.3. 2018 AM and PM peak-hour build-out volumes for a 100,000 sf church can be
found in the Appendix.

7.0      Capacity Analysis

Capacity analyses were performed for the AM and PM peak hours using the Synchro Version 7
software to determine the operating characteristics of the adjacent road network and the impacts
of the proposed project. The North Carolina Department of Transportation uses and reports
Synchro Level-of-Service output for the analysis of intersection operating conditions.

Capacity is defined as the maximum number of vehicles that can pass over a particular road
segment or through a particular intersection within a set time duration. Capacity is described by
Level-of-Service (LOS) for the operating characteristics of a road segment or intersection. LOS
is defined as a qualitative measure that describes operational conditions and motorist perceptions
within a traffic stream. The Highway Capacity Manual defines six levels of service, LOS A
through LOS F, with A being the best and F being the worst. LOS D is the typically accepted
standard for signalized intersections in urban and suburban areas. For signalized intersections,
LOS is defined for the overall intersection operation.

LOS for a two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersection is determined by the control delay and is
defined for the minor movements. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-
up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. With respect to field measurements, control
delay is defined as the total elapsed time from the time a vehicle stops at the end of the queue to
the time the vehicle departs from the stop line. LOS is not defined for a TWSC intersection as a
whole. For descriptive purposes, results between LOS A and LOS C for the side street approach
are assumed to represent short delays. Results between LOS D and LOS E for the side street
approach are assumed to represent moderate delays, and LOS F for the side street approach is
assumed to represent long delays. It is typical for stop sign controlled side streets and driveways
intersecting major streets to experience long delays during peak hours, particularly for left-turn
movements. The majority of the traffic moving through the intersection on the major street
experiences little or no delay.

Table 7.0-A lists the LOS control delay thresholds published in the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) for signalized intersections. Synchro Version 7 software uses the same LOS thresholds as
those published in the HCM.

Under 2011 existing conditions, the intersections currently operates at LOS C during the AM
peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour.

Under 2018 background conditions, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS D during the
AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour.

Upon build-out of the site in 2018, the intersection is expected to continue to operate at LOS D
during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour. This intersection has recently
been redesigned to improve operational conditions primarily for the eastbound and westbound
traffic along West Catawba Avenue. Due to the second left-turn lane needed on the southbound
approach, split phasing is required to accommodate left-turn movements on each approach. This
type of phasing decreases the amount of green time given to other movements such as the heavily
travelled eastbound and westbound through movements, and thus increases the average delay.

As shown in Table 7.1, the proposed development is expected to add a minimal amount of delay
to this intersection in the form of seven seconds and four seconds during the AM and PM peak
hours, respectively. Based on the trip generation of this development distributed to this
intersection, the amount of traffic entering this intersection contributed by the addition of the
development equals only 4% of the traffic during the AM peak hour and only 3% of the traffic

during the PM peak hour under either development scenario. The results of the analysis show
that regardless of the build-out scenario the proposed development will have little impact on the
intersection operations. Furthermore, since a daycare and church are both local attractions as
opposed to regional attractions, the traffic generated by this site would most likely be traffic that
is already using the network of streets within the study area, and the amount of traffic contributed
to this intersection by the subject development is most likely less than what was analyzed.
Therefore, this analysis is considered conservative and no improvements are recommended at this
intersection for capacity purposes.

and the 100,000 sf build scenario.

Under 2011 existing conditions, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS B during the AM
peak hour and LOS C during the PM peak hour.

Under 2018 background conditions, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS C during the
AM peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour.

Upon build-out of the site in 2014, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS C during the
AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour. The LOS during the PM peak hour on the
eastbound approach is expected to decline to a LOS E upon build-out of the site. However, this
approach serves a hotel and a restaurant with very little volume (23 vehicles during the PM peak
hour) and no volume is contributed to the proposed church. The opposite stop-controlled
approach shows a minimal impact due to the site in the form of two seconds and five seconds
during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively, while operating at an acceptable LOS. Since the
proposed project is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of this
intersection, no improvements are recommended for capacity purposes.

The results of the analysis show that regardless of the build-out scenario the proposed
development will have little impact on the intersection operations.

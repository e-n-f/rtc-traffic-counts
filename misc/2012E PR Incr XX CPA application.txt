 Transportation
                 No amendments to the Future Land Use Map are being requested. The proposed
                 amendment is to reflect the elimination of Palmer Ranch Parkway East, from Honore
                 Avenue to Clark Road from the Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan.
                 Palmer Ranch Parkway East is not currently listed in the Sarasota-Manatee
                 Metropolitan Planning Organization's (MPO) Financially Feasible Plan, nor is it
                 included in the 2035 LRTP Model. This roadway segment is more reflective of access
                 needs as opposed to a roadway capacity need. The elimination of this segment of Palmer
                 Ranch Parkway East, as a major collector would not adversely affect the long range
                 transportation plans of Sarasota County.
                 15.        Please calculate the traffic generation potential of the maximum allowable
                            intensity/density of the proposed designation as compared with the present
                            designation. The assumptions used in this determination should be shown.
                            No Future Land Use Map amendments are being requested. The proposed
                            development associated with the AIDA for Palmer Ranch Increment XX being
                            processed concurrently with this application proposes a total of 267 single-family
                            dwelling units. The 267 single-family dwelling units were compared to the
                            development intensities included as part of the Palmer Ranch 2009 Transportation
                            Reanalysis. The analysis has demonstrated that there sufficient transportation
                            capacity to support the proposed development through the anticipated build-out of
                            the DRI. The impacts of removing Palmer Ranch Parkway East from the Future
                            Thoroughfare Plan were evaluated for the year 2017, using an approved growth
                            rate and existing road network and the year 2035 using the 2035 Financially
                            Feasible FSUTMS model. Acceptable level-of-service standards can be met
                            without Palmer Ranch Parkway East in the Future Thoroughfare Plan. Note:
                            Palmer Ranch Parkway is not part of the current adopted 2035 Financially
                            Feasible model.

INTRODUCTION

This amendment is being submitted in conjunction with land use approvals being sought for
Parcel's U3, U4 and P4 of the Palmer Ranch Development of Regional Impact (DRI). This
Comprehensive Plan Amendment is being processed pursuant to Chapter 380.06, Florida
Statutes along with the following applications:
       ·       DRI Application for Incremental Development Approval (AIDA) (Increment XX)
       ·       Rezone Application (213.57 acres), OUE-1 (Open Use Estate, 1 dwelling unit/ 5 Acre) to
               RSF-1/PUD (Residential Single-Family/ Planned Unit Development, 2.5 dwelling units/
               Acre.

Palmer Ranch Parkway East is not currently listed in the Sarasota-Manatee Metropolitan
Planning Organization's (MPO) Financially Feasible Plan, nor is it included in the 2035 LRTP
Model. It is more reflective of access needs as opposed to a roadway capacity need. The
transportation analysis confirms that Palmer Ranch Parkway East will function as a local road,
not as a major collector roadway. Thus, the elimination of this segment of Palmer Ranch
Parkway East as a major collector will not adversely affect the long range transportation plans of
Sarasota County.

A neighborhood workshop was held on February 21, 2012 at the Covenant Life Presbyterian
Church, on McIntosh Road, within Palmer Ranch, Sarasota, FL. (See Exhibit B.)


REQUESTED AMENDMENT

Amend the Transportation Chapter of the Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan by deleting
Palmer Ranch Parkway East, between Honore Avenue and Clark Road, from the "Sarasota
County "Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan," including Figure 6-9: "Year 2025 Future
Thoroughfare Plan (Functional Classification) and" Figure 6-10: "Year 2025 Future
Thoroughfare Plan (By Lanes), and Appendix D, Section 4 Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare
Plan, as follows:
       ·       Figure 6-9: Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan (Functional Classifications) -- delete
               Palmer Ranch Parkway East, between Honore Avenue and Clark Road
       ·       Figure 6-10: Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan (By Lanes) ­ delete Palmer Ranch
               Parkway East, between Honore Avenue and Clark Road;
       ·       Amend Appendix D, Section 4: Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan, Major Collectors
               Section-- strikethrough Palmer Ranch Parkway East between Honore Avenue and Clark
               Road; and
       ·       Any other amendment as necessary to effectuate the change of designation of this
               segment of Palmer Ranch Parkway East from a major collector to a local road, and to
               ensure internal consistency within the Comprehensive Plan.

BACKGROUND

Future thoroughfare plans classify roadways based upon their relationship between the
movement of traffic and the degree of access to surrounding land uses. The Sarasota County
Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan includes seven roadway classifications: freeways/
expressways, major arterials, minor arterials, major collectors, minor collectors, significant local
roads and local roads. Palmer Ranch Parkway, between McIntosh Road and Honore Avenue,
                                                                                              1 of 9

03/29/2012
\\us1227-f01\workgroup\2156\active\215610675\shared\report\cpa_application\cpa_application_20110329.docx
and Palmer Ranch Parkway East, between Honore Avenue and Clark Road are designated as
4-lane Major Collectors.

The Transportation Chapter states that Major Collectors collect and distribute significant
amounts of traffic between arterials, minor collectors and local roads at moderate to low
operating speeds. Major collectors provide for more accessibility to adjacent properties than
arterials. Minor Collectors collect and distribute moderate amounts of traffic between arterials,
major collectors and local roads at relatively low operating speeds with greater accessibility than
major collectors. Local roads possess relatively low traffic volumes, operating speeds and trip
lengths, and minimal through traffic movements generally provide access to abutting properties.
Only when high traffic volumes compromise a local road's ability to accommodate pedestrian
and bicycle traffic, should the road be redesignated as a Significant Local Road.

Existing Conditions

Currently, Palmer Ranch Parkway East is constructed as a 2-lane divided roadway, between
McIntosh Road and Honore Avenue. Approximately 2,000 feet of Palmer Ranch Parkway East
is currently constructed east of Honore Avenue. It currently serves the Glen Ridge development,
within Increment XIII to the north and the VillageWalk development to the south within
Increment XV of the Palmer Ranch Development of Regional Impact (DRI).

Build-Out Conditions

Palmer Ranch Parkway East will serve as the primary access road within the residential
development in Palmer Ranch Increment XX. It will function as a main road through a residential
subdivision as opposed to that of the principal roadway collecting and dispersing traffic between
developments and arterial roadways. Ultimately, this roadway will connect to the Clark Road
frontage road (refer to a graphic in the report). When completed, Palmer Ranch Parkway East
will continue to function as a local road, not as a major collector that collects and distributes
significant amounts of traffic between arterials, minor collectors and local roads at moderate to
low operating speeds.

ANALYSIS

Transportation Planning

The Sarasota Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) is a regional transportation
planning agency that coordinates transportation plans and programming activities (local,
County, State, and Federal) within the Sarasota and Manatee area. Its emphasis is on planning
for urban areas, as determined by federal regulations. The technical foundation of the "Sarasota
County Year 2025 Future Thoroughfare Plan" is the Sarasota-Manatee-Charlotte (SMC)
regional travel demand model, which was developed by the Florida Department of
Transportation.

The MPO has completed the process of updating the long range plan for the two county study
area to identify the thoroughfare system that will be needed through the year 2025. The
Sarasota County Planning and Development Services Business Center has worked closely with
the MPO to ensure that the year 2025 land use patterns were adequately represented in the
MPO's Year 2025 Long Range Transportation Plan Update, including the Year 2025 Financially
Feasible Transportation Plan. As a result, the land use data and population projections utilized
in the MPO update are consistent with the land use and population projections used in the
updated Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan's Future Land Use Plan and Map.
                                                                                              2 of 9

Palmer Ranch Parkway East is not currently listed in the Sarasota-Manatee Metropolitan
Planning Organization's (MPO) Financially Feasible Plan, nor is it included in the 2035 LRTP
Model because was a developer requested improvement driven more by the need to provide
access to the undeveloped lands as opposed to a pure roadway capacity need.

Transportation Impact Analysis

The proposed development associated with the AIDA for Palmer Ranch Increment XX proposes
a total of 267 single-family dwelling units. The 267 single-family dwelling units were compared to
the development intensities included as part of the Palmer Ranch 2009 Transportation
Reanalysis. The analysis has demonstrated that there sufficient transportation capacity to
support the proposed development through the anticipated build-out of the DRI. The impacts of
removing Palmer Ranch Parkway East from the Future Thoroughfare Plan were evaluated for
the year 2017, using an approved growth rate and existing road network and the year 2035
using the 2035 Financially Feasible FSUTMS model. Acceptable level-of-service standards can
be met without Palmer Ranch Parkway East in the Future Thoroughfare Plan. Note: Palmer
Ranch Parkway is not part of the current adopted 2035 Financially Feasible model.

(Please refer to Exhibit A -- Traffic Analysis)

Dear Mr. Hussain:

Reference:        Palmer Ranch Parcels P4, U3, and U4
                  Transportation Methodology Statement

We have reviewed your comments of March 8, 2012, and offer the following responses and additional
documentation:

    1.   Please provide analysis for the intersection of Honore Avenue and Palmer Ranch Parkway for the AM
         and PM peak hour periods. The adequacy of the turning lanes shall be addressed.
         Response: Noted and will be provided.

    2.   For the comprehensive plan amendment, provide the following:

         a.   Generalized level of service analysis of the existing plus fully funded road network for 2017
              conditions. This scenario should include traffic volume increases for growth reasonably expected
              to occur. An acceptable approach is to use current counts with growth rates plus an assignment of
              trips for the development proposed for rezoning. Contact me to review options for establishing
              growth rates.
              Response: Noted and will be provided.

         b.   Generalized level of service analysis of the 2035 cost feasible network, with and without the road
              proposed to be removed from the thoroughfare plan. Travel demand modeling using the Sarasota-
              Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization's 2035 Long Range Transportation Plan datasets is
              an acceptable method for estimating long range traffic volumes.
              Response: Noted and will be provided.

We trust that these responses satisfactorily address your comments, but if you should need additional
information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
WilsonMiller Stantec

              Transportation Methodology Statement

Dear Ms. Wiggins:

This letter serves to summarize the Transportation Methodology for the subject project for your
approval. The proposed development is located near the intersection of Honore Avenue and
Palmer Ranch Parkway. The proposed development will consist of 267 single-family dwelling
units. The 267 single-family dwelling units will be compared to the development intensities
included as part of the Palmer Ranch 2009 Transportation Reanalysis. The analysis will
demonstrate a net decrease in trip generation potential, based on the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Rates, Trip Generation ­ the 8th Edition (2008). A land use transfer matrix will
be included as part of the analysis that shows how development intensities can be traded out.

In addition to comparing development intensities, the impacts of removing Palmer Ranch
Parkway East from the Future Thoroughfare Plan will be evaluated by using the 2035
Financially Feasible FSUTMS model. It will be demonstrated that acceptable level-of-service
standards can be met without Palmer Ranch Parkway in the Future Thoroughfare Plan. The
2035 Financially Feasible model will be run with and without Palmer Ranch Parkway East;
however, Palmer Ranch Parkway is not part of the current adopted 2035 Financially Feasible
model.

If the above methodology is acceptable, please send written confirmation so we can proceed
with the study. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
WilsonMiller Stantec

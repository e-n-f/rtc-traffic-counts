       A couple of departments are short-handed on staff with illnesses and employees that have
left employment with the city.

         DATE OF MEETING: November 12, 2015

         AGENDA ITEM:                Traffic Signal at the Intersection of 6th Street and Pacific Avenue and the
                                     Adoption of a Revised Intersection Control Map

         PRESENTER:                  Blake Madden, Director of Public Works and Utilities

         ISSUE SUMMARY: The traffic signal at the intersection of 6th Street and Pacific Avenue is
         antiquated and unsightly. In considering updating the traffic signal, City staff debated whether
         it was warranted at this location. In October 2014, the City submitted an application to the
         Traffic Engineering Assistance Program (TEAP) administered by the Kansas Department of
         Transportation (KDOT). The City requested that a traffic study and traffic signal warrant analysis
         be conducted to determine the necessity for the existing signal. The application was approved
         and in February 2015, the City received the final draft of a study compiled by Parsons
         Brinckerhoff, a consulting firm contracted by KDOT through the TEAP (attached). The
         conclusion of the study recommended removal of the existing traffic signal and the installation
         of two-way stop control for traffic on Pacific Avenue.


         Changing the intersection control at this location requires modification of the City’s Intersection
         Control Map and the City Council’s approval of such changes. Review of the existing
         Intersection Control Map revealed that the location of existing intersection control signage was
         not in accordance with that shown on the map. I have recently completed an updated map
         accurately illustrating the location of all existing intersection traffic control signage and devices.


         My intent was to, in the coming months, propose minor changes to the existing intersection
         traffic control signage and devices to the Public Safety Committee and eventually submit to
         Council a revised and all-inclusive Intersection Control Map. The removal of the 6th Street and
         Pacific Avenue traffic signal was to be included as a revision for consideration. However, on
         Tuesday, November 3, 2015, I received a phone call from Terry Upshaw notifying me that the
         traffic signal had malfunctioned and was flashing amber for traffic on 6th Street and flashing red
         for traffic on Pacific Avenue. Anticipating that the removal of this signal may be approved and

                                                                                                                                               A18
        accomplished within the next several months, I directed him to install stop signs on the Pacific
        Avenue legs of the intersection and leave the signal in the flashing condition.


        If Council chooses to preserve the traffic signal at the intersection, the following are the
        estimated associated costs:


             -   $3,000 to $5,000                    Repair the existing signal to its previous phased condition
             -   $125,000 to $200,000                Install a new traffic signal
             -   $1,000 to $2,500                    Yearly maintenance


        Depending on whether Council chooses to preserve the traffic signal, we have created two new
        Intersection Control Maps for consideration for adoption. One depicting the preservation of the
        traffic signal, the other depicting its removal and the installation of stop signs on the Pacific
        Avenue legs to create a two-way stop condition. Note that neither of the maps include the
        Northland area. It is my intent to include this area on the map submitted to the Public Safety
        Committee for other minor revisions.

        COUNCIL ACTION NEEDED: Decide whether to preserve the 6th Street and Pacific Avenue traffic
        signal and adopt the appropriate Intersection Control Map.

        STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL: Approve removal of the 6th Street and Pacific Avenue
        traffic signal and adopt the Intersection Control Map depicting its removal and the installation
        of stop signs on the Pacific Avenue legs.

1 Introduction and Summary
The Traffic Engineering Assistance Program (TEAP) provides a way for roadways not managed by the
Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) to receive necessary traffic analysis that the roadway may
not otherwise receive. Local jurisdictions apply for funds by describing their potential issues, which are
then evaluated and analyzed by both KDOT staff and a consultant in order to provide recommendations
to the local jurisdiction.

 1.1 TEAP PROGRAM OVERVIEW
The Traffic Engineering Assistance Program is administered by the Kansas Department of
Transportation. TEAP provides federal funds to local municipalities and counties that have traffic
engineering needs but do not typically have the staff or funds to investigate the issues. These funds are
used on roadways and intersections that are generally not on state routes addressed by KDOT staff.

 1.2 SUMMARY
Based on the review of all traffic signal warrants from the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD), and using engineering judgment, the existing traffic signal at 6th Street & W. Pacific
Avenue in Osawatomie, Kansas neither meets nor is expected to meet any of the nine traffic signal
warrants. It is recommended that the existing traffic signal at this location be removed and replaced
with two-way stop control for W. Pacific Avenue. Detailed recommendations and guidelines for how to
implement this recommendation are found in Chapter 4 of this report.




KDOT Project Number: SP-0618-15                                                                           6

2 Existing Issues Description
The Director of Public Works in the City of Osawatomie, Kansas submitted an application to KDOT
requesting that a traffic study be performed at the intersection of 6th Street and W. Pacific Avenue in
order to determine whether to maintain or remove the current traffic signal at this location. The
problem statement from the city read:
“The City of Osawatomie currently has an antiquated traffic signal installed at this location. It is likely
that this signal was installed prior to the construction of the U.S. 169 Highway on the east side of town
and is no longer needed. The city is reluctant to spend tax dollars to maintain, repair and eventually
replace this signal if it is no longer serving its initial intent.”

The primary focus of this study will be to evaluate the existing traffic signal to determine whether it
meets any of the MUTCD traffic signal warrants. Traffic signal warrants 1 (eight-hour vehicular volume),
2 (four-hour vehicular volume), 3 (peak hour) and 5 (school crossing) will be specifically reviewed, but
the other five will be briefly discussed. If none of the warrants are met, an alternative intersection
control type will be recommended along with permanent signing and pavement markings to accompany
the recommended new intersection control.

 2.1 OVERVIEW OF AREA
The study area is constrained to the roadway network at the intersection of 6th Street and W. Pacific
Avenue in Osawatomie, Kansas. Osawatomie is a small city located in Miami County in northeast Kansas
approximately 30 miles southwest of Olathe, Kansas. The population in 2013 was estimated to be 4,385
(United States Census Bureau, 2014). Figure 1 shows a map of the intersection of interest and the study
limits. Based on discussions with the City of Osawatomie there is no projected traffic growth expected
at the intersection in the foreseeable future.

 2.2 REVIEW OF PAST TRAFFIC STUDIES
As part of the study, a request was made to KDOT to identify past traffic studies that had recommended
the traffic signal installation at the intersection prior to 1977. This was the approximate time when the
US-169/K-7 highway was moved east of the City. KDOT was unable to locate a previous traffic study or
resolution which had recommended the installation of a traffic signal at this location. City staff
however, located a TEAP study from 2004 which covered school area traffic control analysis for the
elementary school, middle school, high school and early childhood education center in the City. This
TEAP study was reviewed, but there was very little information of interest in the 2004 study that
concerned the intersection of 6th Street & W. Pacific Avenue.

3 Field Data Collection and Analysis
A site visit was conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff on Tuesday, December 23, 2014 to investigate
existing conditions, take photographs of the study area, review existing lane configurations and review
other safety features. A brief visit with the City’s Public Works Director, Mr. Blake Madden, was also
conducted on the same day. Mr. Madden did not have any additional concerns regarding the
intersection, other than he did not think the traffic signal warrants were being met. Traffic volume
counts were collected by Quality Counts, LLC, a Parsons Brinkerhoff sub-consultant, on Tuesday,
December 16, 2014. Approach traffic volumes for each of the four legs of the intersection were
collected for 24-hours via roadway tube counters, while intersection turning movement counts were
collected via video cameras from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. to capture the
expected peak vehicular and pedestrian volumes.
The following sections discuss the existing conditions, crash history and traffic signal warrants.

 3.1 EXISTING SIGNALS
The existing eastbound and westbound signals are mounted on single poles, while the northbound and
southbound signals are mounted on mast arms as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. There are two
actuated pedestrian signals mounted on the signal poles on the northeast and northwest corners of the
intersection (Figure 4). The red signal indications are 12 inches in diameter, while the yellow and green
signal indications are 8 inches in diameter.

 3.2 CURRENT SIGNAGE AND PAVEMENT MARKING
The existing signage at the intersection primarily consists of a ground mounted street name sign, and a
“Right- Turn-on-Red After Stop” sign both mounted in the northeast corner of the intersection (Figure
5).




Figure 5 - “Right-Turn-on-Red After Stop” Sign in Northeast Corner


A close review of the intersection configuration reveals left turn bays for both the northbound and
southbound left turns. These are difficult to distinguish because the pavements markings are
exceptionally faded and difficult to see (Figure 6 through Figure 8).

 3.3 CRASH REVIEW AND ANALYSIS
A copy of five years of intersection crash data, from 2009 through 2013, including hard copy reports,
were obtained from KDOT and the City of Osawatomie. There were two crashes which were
intersection related over this five year period.
The first crash occurred at 8:35 a.m. when an eastbound left turning driver struck and injured a
pedestrian crossing eastbound at the crosswalk on the north leg of the intersection. The crash occurred
during the day, under no adverse weather conditions, and on dry pavement. The second crash occurred
when a southbound driver failed to stop for the red light at the traffic signal and collided in the middle
of the intersection at a right angle with a westbound driver who had a green light. The crash occurred at
7:49 a.m. during daylight, under no adverse weather conditions, and on dry pavement. Neither of these
two crashes appears to have been caused directly by the existing traffic signal, nor would crashes of this
type likely be reduced by removing the traffic signal.

 3.4 SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS
The MUTCD is the primary resource for providing the criteria to either install or remove a traffic signal at
an intersection. Information from the MUTCD will be referenced and directly repeated extensively
throughout this section.

The selection and use of traffic signals is based on an engineering study of traffic operations, safety,
pedestrian and bicyclist needs and other factors at intersections, coupled with engineering judgment.
The investigation of the need for a traffic signal includes an analysis of nine traffic signal warrants. The
MUTCD states that “The satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or warrants shall not in itself require the
installation of a traffic control signal” (Federal Highway Administration, 2009). These nine warrants are
reviewed individually and often reference the major street and the minor street. Based on traffic
volumes, the major street at this location is 6th Street, while the minor street is W. Pacific Avenue.
The Highway Capacity Software (HCS) v6.60 was used to assist in evaluating some traffic signal warrants.
HCS implements procedures defined in the Highway Capacity Manual to analyze different types of
roadway facilities and intersections. Traffic signal warrants are often based on the volume of traffic on
an approach, without regard to whether drivers are turning left, continuing through, or turning right.
The HCS traffic signal warrant module offers the option for entering volumes by movement. For the
purpose of this analysis all approach volumes are assumed to be through volumes.

    3.4.1 Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 1 is intended for application at locations where a large volume of intersecting traffic occurs, or
where traffic volumes are so heavy on the major street that the minor intersecting street suffers
excessive delay or conflict while entering or crossing the major street. If a warrant or part of a warrant
is met, there would be a checked box on the right edge of Table 1. The HCS traffic signal warrants
module provides a full analysis for Warrant 1 based on the approach volumes which were entered
(Table 2). The table shows that the existing volumes at this location do not meet Warrant 1.

   3.4.2 Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 2 is intended for application at locations where a large volume of intersecting traffic occurs. To
meet this warrant, traffic volumes for each of any four hours of an average day must fall above the
applicable curve. The HCS traffic signal warrants module provides a full analysis for Warrant 2 based on
the approach volumes which were entered (Table 2). The existing volumes do not meet Warrant 2.

    3.4.3 Warrant 3, Peak Hour
Warrant 3 is intended for use at locations where traffic conditions are such that for a minimum of one
hour of an average day, the minor-street traffic suffers undue delay when entering or crossing the major
street. This traffic signal warrant shall be applied only in unusual cases, such as office complexes,
manufacturing plans, industrial complexes, or high-occupancy vehicle facilities that attract or discharge
large numbers of vehicle over a short time. The HCS traffic signal warrants module provides a full
analysis for Warrant 3 based on the approach volumes which were entered (Table 2).
Warrant 3 is often the focus of a study during intersection control discussions. In addition to Table 1
and Table 2 shown earlier, Figure 9 shows how far away the intersection is from meeting Warrant 3
(Peak Hour). To meet this warrant, either the blue or the green dot designating the AM and PM peak
hour volumes would need to be above the curve for “2 or more lanes & 1 lane,” as the existing 6th
Street has a designated left turn bay which gives it two lanes on the approach. As shown in Figure 9, the
blue and green dots do not meet the peak hour warrant.

KDOT Traffic Engineering Assistance Progam
City of Osawatomie, 6th Street & W Pacific Avenue, Traffic Signal Warrants

Based on the observations discussed above, the existing peak hour volumes do not meet Warrant 3.

   3.4.4 Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume
Warrant 4 is intended for use at locations where the traffic volume on the major street is so heavy that
pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street. There are various criteria based on
population, intersection location, major street speed limit, etc., but the minimum total pedestrian
crossings of the major street would need to be 75 pedestrians per hour to even meet the lowest criteria.
Of the hours which turning movement counts were taken, the highest number of pedestrians per hour
crossing the major street was one pedestrian per hour. The existing pedestrian volumes crossing the
major street do not meet Warrant 4.

   3.4.5 Warrant 5, School Crossing
Warrant 5 is intended for applications where the need for school children to cross the major street is the
principal reason to consider installing a traffic signal. School children include elementary through high
school students. While the data collected does not differentiate between the general public and
schoolchildren, in either case, the warrant requires a minimum of 20 school children during the highest
crossing hour. The 2004 TEAP study which focused on school traffic control in the City stated that there
were no middle school students observed crossing 6th Street near the Osawatomie Middle School, but
suggested that if students did cross 6th Street, they utilize the traffic signal at the 6th Street & W. Pacific
Avenue (TranSystems Corporation, 2004). As noted in Warrant 4, the highest number of pedestrians
crossing the major street was one pedestrian per hour. The existing school children volumes crossing
the major street do not meet Warrant 5.

   3.4.6 Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System
Warrant 6 is intended for applications where a traffic signal would help maintain proper platooning of
vehicles as part of a coordinated signal system. The traffic signal at 6th Street & W. Pacific Avenue is not
part of a coordinated signal system and does not meet Warrant 6.

    3.4.7 Warrant 7, Crash Experience
Warrant 7 is intended for applications where the severity and frequency of crashes are the principal
reasons to consider installing a traffic signal. There are a number of criteria, all of which must be met to
satisfy this warrant. One of the criteria reads “Five or more reported crashes, of types susceptible to
correction by a traffic control signal, have occurred within a 12-month period, each crash involving
personal injury or property damage apparently exceeding the applicable requirements for a reportable
crash” (Federal Highway Administration, 2009, p. 4C.08). Since the existing intersection has a traffic
signal already installed, this criteria cannot be evaluated. However, it is not expected that the removal
of the traffic signal will result in the criteria above being met, along with the other criteria listed in the
MUTCD for Warrant 7.

    3.4.8 Warrant 8, Roadway Network
Warrant 8 is intended for intersections where it might be justified to encourage concentration and
organization of traffic flow on a roadway network. The existing signal at 6th Street & W. Pacific Avenue
is not intended to encourage concentration or organization of traffic flow as it applies to Warrant 8. As
a result, Warrant 8 is not met.

    3.4.9 Warrant 9, Intersection Near Grade Crossing
Warrant 9 is intended for use at locations where none of the conditions described in the other eight
traffic signal warrants are met, but the proximity of the intersection to a railroad grade crossing on an
intersection approach controlled by a stop or yield sign is the principal reason to consider installing a
traffic signal. Among the criteria required to meet this warrant is one which states that the center of the
railroad track nearest to the intersection shall be within 140 feet of the stop line or yield line on the
approach if this warrant is to be considered further. While there is a railroad grade crossing to the west,
the existing traffic signal is not intended to meet Warrant 9, and the distance from the intersection to
the railroad tracks is approximately 500 feet. The existing conditions do not meet Warrant 9.
Table 3 below shows a summary of the traffic warrants analyzed and the results of that analysis.

4 Recommendations and Implementation for Intersection Control Types
The review of all traffic signal warrants from the 2009 MUTCD, along with applying engineering
judgment, shows that the existing traffic signal at 6th Street & W. Pacific Avenue does not meet, and is
not expected to meet, any of the nine traffic signal warrants. It is recommended that the existing traffic
signal at this location be removed.
The sections below discuss recommendations for the control of traffic at 6th Street & W. Pacific Avenue
in lieu of a traffic signal, as well as supplementary signage and pavement marking at this location.

 4.1 CONTROL TYPE RECOMMENDATIONS
Given that the existing signal does not meet any of the warrants and the current low volume is from the
minor road; it is recommended that a two-way stop-controlled intersection be installed in place of the
existing traffic signal. The northbound and southbound volumes along 6th Street are the higher traffic
volumes and should not have the stop signs installed for those approaches (free-flow conditions). The
stop signs should be placed on the east and west legs of the intersection, for the eastbound and
westbound approaches of W. Pacific Avenue. Before intersection control can be changed from a traffic
signal to a two-way stop, intersection sight distances must be reviewed to verify that drivers on the
stopped approaches have adequate time to cross or turn onto the main roadway.
The concept of being able to view approaching traffic at an intersection is referred to as intersection
sight distance. Typically the design and construction of roadways (including intersection sight distance)
in the U.S. is guided by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.” This reference book is often
referred to as the “Green Book” and the current edition was published in 2011.
Based on field visit observations, intersection sight distances are not expected to be an issue for the
two-way stop-control with regard to the location of the nearby buildings or permanent structures.
However, there is room for parking on 6th Street for northbound vehicles just south of W. Pacific
Avenue. If vehicles were parked here (Figure 10), it’s probable that the intersection sight distance for
westbound drivers on W. Pacific Avenue would be reduced due to the parked vehicles blocking drivers
from observing northbound approaching vehicles.

Figure 10 - On-street Parallel Parking Located on Northbound 6th St. Just South of W. Pacific Ave.


For drivers wanting to make a westbound left turn, the driver should be able to see 225 feet down 6th
Street from the point they stopped on W. Pacific Avenue given 6th Street’s regulatory speed limit of 20
mph (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, 2011, pp. 9-38). Figure 11
shows the approximate intersection sight distance triangle in yellow which is created for westbound left
turns at the intersection. The area of the yellow triangle covers nearly all of the available on-street
northbound parking along 6th Street.

Figure 11 - Approximate Recommended Intersection Sight Distance for Westbound Left Turns (6th St. & W.
Pacific Ave.)


However, in urban areas, it’s common to have on-street parking. It is also common for drivers to have
to stop for crosswalks or pedestrians, and then pull up closer to the intersection past the stop line to see
around on-street parked vehicles when they are present. The effect of this is shown in the green
triangle in Figure 11.
The recommendation for the existing on-street parallel parking located on northbound 6th Street just
south of W. Pacific Avenue is for the parking to remain. With an existing parking lot in the southeast
corner of the intersection, it is assumed that the on-street parking is not regularly used. The City of
Osawatomie Police and Public Works Departments should be cognizant of this potential issue, and if a
pattern of crashes emerges in the future, the recommended solution would be to remove the on-street
parking, either by physically replacing it by expanding the sidewalk, or to post no-parking signs outside
of the pedestrian access route which is a minimum of 4 feet wide along the sidewalk in order to comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements (p. R301.3.1).

 4.2 SIGNING AND PAVEMENT MARKINGS RECOMMENDATIONS
Due to the low pedestrian volumes collected at the intersection, crosswalk markings are not
recommended at this intersection (across 6th St. or W. Pacific Ave.). However, the eastbound and
westbound stop line pavement markings should be located as if the crosswalk markings were present.


KDOT Project Number: SP-0618-15                                                                          22
                                                                                                               A41
KDOT Traffic Engineering Assistance Progam
City of Osawatomie, 6th Street & W Pacific Avenue, Traffic Signal Warrants

This way, drivers are encouraged to stop before the sidewalk, and a pedestrian at the crossing would
have the right-of-way. Figure 12 shows the location of the stop line as recommended by KDOT as part of
their standard drawings for pavement markings.




Figure 12 - Recommended Stop Line Placement
Source: (Kansas Department of Transportation)
It is also recommended that the centerlines and the northbound and southbound left turn bay
pavement markings and arrows be remarked to allow drivers to distinguish between the through and
left turn lanes.
One Stop (R1-1) sign should be placed at the intersection on each of the eastbound and westbound
approaches of W. Pacific Avenue. The stop signs should have minimum dimensions of 30” wide by 30”
high, although 36” wide by 36” high are also acceptable for this location. It is recommended that the
stop sign sizes match what is typically used for new installations in the City within this area of town. This
is to avoid over or under emphasizing the stop signs in relation to similar locations. The stop signs
should be placed at the stop line. Figure 13 shows the recommended stop sign and stop line placement
at the intersection.

 4.3 OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that the existing overhead streetlight that is currently mounted on the traffic signal
pole at the northeast corner of the intersection remain or be relocated at the intersection. Providing
street lighting at intersections can help prevent/reduce night-time crashes and provides additional
visibility to pedestrians and motorists.

 4.4 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
The following steps provide some guidance on removing the existing traffic signal. The steps are loosely
based on guidance provided in the MUTCD (Federal Highway Administration, 2009, p. 4B.02.05).
    1. Inform the public of the traffic study which recommended the removal of the traffic signal.
    2. Make initial intersection control changes.
              a. Place one New Traffic Pattern Ahead (W23-2) sign on each approach a minimum of 100
                 feet upstream of the intersection. This will alert drivers of the changes to the
                 intersection. It is recommended that the W23-2 signs be removed after two weeks of
                 display.
              b. Install the two stop signs for the eastbound and westbound movements.

                                                                                                               A43

City of Osawatomie, 6th Street & W Pacific Avenue, Traffic Signal Warrants

              c. Cover the vehicular and pedestrian traffic signal heads on all approaches. The signal
                 heads should be covered completely using an opaque material.
              d. Cover the “Right Turn on Red After Stop” sign located on a wooden pole in the
                 northeast corner for northbound drivers using an opaque material.
    3. If traffic operations at the intersection with the new two-way stop control appear to be
       functioning well after 90 days (no crashes, issues with sight distance or congestion, other),
       remove the traffic signal equipment and the “Right Turn on Red After Stop” sign.

 4.5 COST ESTIMATES
The construction cost estimates are based on Parsons Brinckerhoff’s (PB) professional experience and
judgment and shall be deemed to represent PB’s opinion. PB has no control over the cost of labor,
material, equipment and other relevant factors that could influence the ultimate construction costs.
Thus, PB does not guarantee that proposals, bids, or the actual facility cost will be the same as the
estimate of probable construction cost or that construction costs will not vary from its opinions of
probable cost.
Costs for design, right-of-way, coordination, or construction oversight are not included in the following
cost estimates.
Cost estimates for implementing the recommendations are listed below. Included in the total costs for
each item are a 25% fee for miscellaneous items and a 30% fee for contingencies.
         The estimated cost for temporary traffic control and installation of the permanent stop signs
         would be approximately $4,300.

         The estimated cost for the removal of existing traffic signals and the relocation of the street light
         would be approximately $9,700.

         The estimated costs for repainting the centerline, left turn lanes, arrows, and new stop line
         pavement markings recommendations at the intersection is approximately $3,200.

 6.1 RECOMMENDED SIGN SIZES
Table 4 shows the recommended sign sizes along with specific sign designations. All of these signs sizes
are for roadways which meet the 2009 MUTCD criteria for low speed, urban, conventional roadways.
The intersection reviewed in this study meets those criteria. Standard sign sizes which are larger may be
used as well to match typical signs at similar locations within the City. The table may be used for
consistency when discussing various signs or ordering signs from a supplier. Sign sizes are given in
inches (width x height).

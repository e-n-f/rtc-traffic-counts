RE: Luscher Farms Master Plan Transportation Analysis

Dear Ms. Gilmer,

This transportation assessment report has been prepared to support the proposed Luscher Farms
Master Plan in Lake Oswego, Oregon. This report examines the characteristics of the Luscher Farms
Master Plan proposal and identifies the transportation infrastructure needs required to support the
overall master plan vision.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The existing Luscher Area is located in the northeast quadrant of the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
intersection in Lake Oswego as illustrated in Figure 1. The area currently consists of a multi-use sports
field, a children's play area, walking and biking trails, a 114-stall parking lot, off-leash dog parks,
community gardens, wetlands, open space, environmental/agricultural education facilities, and other
support facilities.

Since the last master planning effort was completed in 1997, the City of Lake Oswego acquired four
properties totaling 81.43 additional acres of land to add to the 70.59 acres that were already owned by
the City. These new land acquisitions, paired with the fact that the City's parks and recreation needs
have changed over the last 15 years, prompted the City to create a new master plan for the 152-acre
Luscher Area.

The master plan is intended to provide long-term direction for the development of all of the public
properties in the Luscher Area. The new Master Plan vision includes the following elements in addition
to the existing attributes: two neighborhood parks (Farr and Rassekh properties), 8-court tennis center
and parking lot, multi-use athletic field and parking lot, two basketball courts, oak upland and grassland
restoration, stream and riparian area restoration, expanded community gardens, environmental
education center, agriculture-theme children's play area, open-air shelter, ropes challenge course, and
three new trailheads. Figure 2 illustrates the specific Master Plan vision.

SCOPE OF THE REPORT
The study area includes the following intersections during the weekday p.m. peak hour1:

                 Stafford Road/Overlook Drive/Existing Luscher Park Access
                 Stafford Road/Rosemont Road/Atherton Road
This report addresses the following transportation issues:

                 Year 2012 existing land-use and transportation-system conditions within the site vicinity
                 during the weekday p.m. peak period;
                 Forecast year 2032 background traffic conditions (without the Luscher Farms Master Plan
                 vision) during the weekday p.m. peak period;
                 Trip generation potential for the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision;
                 Forecast year 2032 total traffic conditions (with the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision)
                 during the weekday p.m. peak period; and
                 Site access analysis.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing conditions analysis identifies the site conditions and current operational and geometric
characteristics of the roadways within the study area. These conditions will be compared with future
conditions later in this report.



Site Conditions and Adjacent Land Uses
The Luscher Area currently consists of a multi-use sports field, a children's play area, walking and biking
trails, a 114-stall parking lot, off-leash dog parks, community gardens, wetlands, open space, and
environmental/agricultural education facilities. The area is bounded by Stafford Road to the west,
Rosemont Road to the south, and rural residential areas to the north and east. Vehicular access to the
existing recreational amenities is provided via an access road located at the Stafford Road/Overlook
Drive intersection. In addition, there is a small gravel parking area off of Stafford Road that provides
alternative access to the Luscher Farms dog park and recreational trail.

Traffic Volumes and Peak Hour Operations
In May 2012, manual turning movement counts were obtained for all of the existing study
intersections. All of the counts used in this analysis were conducted on a typical mid-week day during
the evening (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak time period. Figure 4 summarizes the existing weekday p.m.
turning-movement counts. All volumes shown are rounded to the nearest five vehicles per hour.
Appendix "A" contains the traffic count worksheets used in this study.


LEVEL OF SERVICE DESCRIPTION & OPERATING STANDARDS
All level-of-service analyses described in this report were performed in accordance with the procedures
stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. A description of level of service and the criteria by which
they are determined is presented in Appendix "B". Appendix "B" also indicates how level of service is
measured and what is generally considered the acceptable range of level of service.

To ensure that this analysis was based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, the peak 15-minute flow
rate during the peak hour analysis periods was used in the evaluation of all intersection levels of
service. Traffic conditions during other typical weekday hours and throughout most weekends will
likely be better than those described in this report.

Level of service analyses in this report for signalized and roundabout intersections are based on the
intersection's ability to accommodate the most difficult, or critical, approach. Level of service analyses
for signalized intersections in this report are based on the average control delay per vehicle entering
the intersection. The City of Lake Oswego bases intersection operations on level of service (LOS). City of
Lake Oswego standards require that intersections operate at level of service "E" or better (less than 80
seconds of average per vehicle control delay), which includes the Stafford Road/Overlook Drive
intersection. Clackamas County requires that the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout operate at
level of service "D" (less than 55 seconds of average per vehicle control delay).

YEAR 2032 BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The year 2032 background traffic analysis identifies how the study area's transportation system may
operate without the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan vision within a 20-year time period. This
analysis accounts for traffic attributed to general growth in the region, but does not include traffic from
the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan.


PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
No funded transportation capacity improvements exist within the site vicinity. The only currently
identified (non-funded) project is the installation of bike lanes along Stafford Road south of the
Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES
While no specific development activities were noted that will add significantly to existing traffic
volumes in the immediate site vicinity, a three percent annual growth rate was assumed along the
Stafford Road and Rosemont Road corridors to account for continued regional traffic growth through
the study area. This growth rate is a conservative representation that is consistent with the Metro
Regional Travel Demand Model and other historical planning efforts in the area. The resulting 2032
weekday p.m. peak hour background traffic volumes are summarized in Figure 5.

2032 BACKGROUND LEVEL-OF-SERVICE ANALYSIS
The 2032 weekday p.m. peak-hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figures 5 were used to
prepare an operational analysis at each study intersection. Similar to existing conditions, the Stafford
Road/Overlook Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably during the p.m. peak
hour. However, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout is forecast to operate over capacity
during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Appendix "D" contains the year 2032 background traffic
operations worksheets.

2032 Stafford Road/Rosemont Road Roundabout Intersection Operations
Table 3 summarizes the 2032 background operational results at the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
intersection. As shown in the Table, the northbound and southbound approaches are forecast to
operate over capacity. In addition, due to delay on both approaches, the overall intersection level of
service is "F". Based on these findings, continued regional traffic growth along the Stafford and
Rosemont Road corridors will require an enhancement to the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
roundabout.

In an effort to identify an appropriate mitigation, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection has
been analyzed under a double lane roundabout design. This design would provide dual entry and exit
lanes on the north and south approaches along Stafford Road. The westbound Rosemont Road
approach would also have dual entry lanes with the right lane designated for right turns and the left
lane designated for left turns. This design is consistent with driver expectations and would provide
continuity if Stafford Road is ever expanded to five lanes. The basic design parameters for this design
are outlined below:

                 Inscribed circle diameter of 175 feet
                 30-foot circulatory width
                 Double-lane entries and exits on the north and south legs (Stafford Road)
                 A continuous right-turn lane on the south leg to facilitate northbound to eastbound
                 movements.

PROPOSED MASTER PLAN
The master plan is intended to provide long-term direction for the development of all of the public
properties in the Luscher Area. The new Master Plan vision includes the following elements in addition
to the existing park attributes: two neighborhood parks (Farr and Rassekh properties), an 8-court
tennis center and parking lot2, multi-use athletic field and parking lot, two basketball courts, oak
upland and grassland restoration, stream and riparian area restoration, expanded community gardens,
environmental education center, agriculture-theme children's play area, open-air shelter, ropes
challenge course, and three new trailheads. Figure 2 illustrates the specific Master Plan vision.

The projected timeframe for complete build-out of the master plan vision is unknown. However, for
the purposes of this analysis, it has been assumed that buildout would occur over a twenty-year
period.


Assumed Access Improvements
The primary access to the Luscher Area is assumed to continue to occur via the Stafford Road/Overlook
Drive intersection. As part of the master plan vision, a secondary access is proposed off of Rosemont
Road. Additional discussion on this secondary access is provided later in this report.

    The 8-court tennis center is technically not a part of the Luscher Farms Master Plan as it will potentially be located on
a separate parcel on the west side of Stafford Road. However, the traffic impacts of this tennis center have been
included in this study at the request of City of Lake Oswego Parks and Recreation staff.

Trip Generation
The existing Luscher Area is a unique community resource that is composed of varied amenities.
Accordingly, there are no empirical data sources that would provide a means of estimating the trip
generation potential of the expanded Luscher Farms Master Plan vision. As such, it was assumed for
the purposes of this analysis that the master plan vision would simply generate a 200% increase in the
amount of existing trips currently being generated by the site. This increase in trip generation is
reasonable given the sizeable increase in amenities and activity areas that would be offered at full
buildout of the master plan vision. Table 5 summarizes the resulting trip generation estimates.

Site Trip Distribution/Trip Assignment
The site-generated trips were distributed onto the study area roadway system based on a review of
existing turning movement patterns and assumed region-wide usage of the Luscher Area. Figure 6
illustrates the estimated trip distribution pattern and net new trip assignment for the proposed master
plan vision.

YEAR 2032 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The total traffic conditions analysis forecasts how the study area's transportation system will operate
with the traffic generated by the proposed master plan vision. The year 2032 background traffic
volumes for the weekday p.m. peak hour (shown in Figure 5) were added to the site-generated traffic
(shown in Figure 5) to arrive at the total traffic volumes illustrated in Figure 6.



2032 Total Traffic Intersection Level of Service
The weekday p.m. peak hour turning-movement volumes shown in Figure 6 were used to conduct an
operational analysis at each study intersection to determine the year 2032 total traffic levels of service.
The results of the total traffic analysis shown in Figure 6 indicate that the Stafford Road/Overlook
Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably. However, like 2032 Background
conditions, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection is forecast to continue to operate over
capacity as a single-lane roundabout. Appendix "E" contains the year 2032 total traffic level-of-service
worksheets.



Stafford Road/Rosemont Road Intersection
Table 6 summarizes the 2032 total traffic operational results at the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
intersection. As shown in the Table, the addition of site-generated traffic from the master plan vision
intensifies the traffic demand at the already over capacity single-lane roundabout.

With the double-lane roundabout mitigation previously identified in the Background conditions, the
Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection would operate acceptably as summarized in Table 7.
Furthermore, with the additional traffic being generated by the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision, no
additional mitigation measures are needed beyond those identified under background traffic
conditions.

ROSEMONT ROAD SITE ACCESS
As previously mentioned, the Master Plan envisions a secondary site access driveway off of Rosemont
Road. The access driveway would be located in the approximate location of the existing Luscher Farms
farm house driveway. This location was chosen as it is the only location along the Rosemont Road site
frontage that would provide adequate sight distance3.

In addition to the sight distance evaluation, the need for an eastbound left-turn lane was evaluated at
the proposed site driveway. The procedures used to determine the need for a left-turn lane were based
on a queuing model titled Volume Warrants for Left-Turn Storage Lanes and Unsignalized Grade
Intersections. The procedures take into account left-turn arrival rates, the volume of advancing and
opposed traffic, and the time interval required to make a left-turn maneuver. Based on the results of
the analysis, it was determined that an eastbound left-turn lane is warranted at the proposed
Rosemont Road site access.

    As part of this analysis, Kittelson & Associates, Inc. performed a preliminary intersection sight distance study at the
proposed Rosemont Road site access driveway location. Based on this analysis, the proposed site driveway would have
in excess of 600 feet of intersection sight distance looking west along Rosemont Road and approximately 600 feet of
intersection sight distance looking east along Rosemont Road. These distances are sufficient per the Clackamas County
Roadway Standards for the 40 mph posted speed and the design speed of 45 mph.

CONCLUSIONS
The results of the traffic analysis indicate that the proposed Luscher Farms Master Plan vision can be
developed while maintaining acceptable levels of service on the surrounding transportation system.
The findings of this analysis and our recommendations are discussed below.


YEAR 2012 EXISTING CONDITIONS
                 All of the study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday p.m. peak
                 hour.


YEAR 2032 BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
                 The Stafford Road/Overlook Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate acceptably
                 during the p.m. peak hour.
                 The Stafford Road/Rosemont Road roundabout is forecast to operate over capacity during
                 the weekday p.m. peak hour.
                               Due to assumed continued growth along the Stafford Road and Rosemont Road
                               corridors, the northbound and southbound approaches are forecast to operate over
                               capacity.

                               With an expansion to a double-lane roundabout, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road
                               intersection would operate acceptably during 2032 background traffic conditions.

                 All of the study intersections currently operate acceptably during the weekday p.m. peak
                 hour.


PROPOSED LUSCHER AREA MASTER PLAN
                 The Master Plan vision includes the following elements in addition to the existing park
                 attributes: two neighborhood parks (Farr and Rassekh properties), an 8-court tennis center
                 and parking lot , multi-use athletic field and parking lot, two basketball courts, oak upland
                 and grassland restoration, stream and riparian area restoration, expanded community
                 gardens, environmental education center, agriculture-theme children's play area, open-air
                 shelter, ropes challenge course, and three new trailheads.
                 It was estimated that full build-out of the master plan vision would generate a 200%
                 increase in the amount of existing trips currently being generated by the site. This increase
                 in trip generation is reasonable given the sizeable increase in amenities and activity areas
                 that would be offered at full buildout of the master plan vision.

October 26, 2012                                                                                           Page: 17


YEAR 2032 TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
                 The Stafford Road/Overlook Drive intersection is forecast to continue to operate
                 acceptably.
                 Like 2032 Background conditions, the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection is forecast
                 to continue to operate over capacity as a single-lane roundabout.
                 With the double-lane roundabout mitigation identified under Background conditions, the
                 Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection would operate acceptably under 2032 total
                 traffic conditions.
                       o With the additional traffic being generated by the Luscher Farms Master Plan vision,
                         no additional mitigation measures are needed beyond those identified under
                         background traffic conditions at the Stafford Road/Rosemont Road intersection.
                 There is adequate intersection sight distance at the proposed Rosemont Road site access.
                 Based on the results of the left-turn lane analysis, it was determined that an eastbound left-
                 turn lane is warranted at the proposed Rosemont Road site access.



We trust this analysis provides adequate documentation to support the Luscher Farms Master Plan. If
you have further questions, please contact us at 503-228-5230.

APPENDIX B LEVEL-OF-SERVICE CONCEPT
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from "A" to "F".1


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
The six level-of-service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table B1.
Additionally, Table B2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per
vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service "D" is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

Table B-1            Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

   Level of
   Service                                                             Average Delay per Vehicle
                   Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and most
      A            vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
                   Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally
                   occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of
      B            average delay.
                   Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher
                   delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
      C            The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
                   Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of
                   congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
                   length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle
      D            failures are noticeable.
                   Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually
                   considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long
       E           cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                   Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This condition
                   often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures.
       F           Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service levels associated
with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B3. A quantitative definition of level of service
for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B4. Using this definition, Level of Service "E" is
generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

                                  B           >10.0 and  15.0

                                  D           >25.0 and  35.0
                                  E           >35.0 and  50.0
                                  F           >50.0




It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is that
drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on the
minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying
acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the HCM
level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay & v/c (HCM 2010).
Roundabout LOS Method: Same as Sign Control.
Vehicle movement LOS values are based on average delay and v/c ratio (degree of saturation) per movement
LOS F will result if v/c > 1 irrespective of movement delay value (does not apply for approaches and intersection).
Intersection and Approach LOS values are based on average delay for all movements (v/c not used as specified in HCM 2010).
Roundabout Capacity Model: US HCM 2010.
HCM Delay Model used. Geometric Delay not included.

Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay & v/c (HCM 2010).
Roundabout LOS Method: Same as Sign Control.
Lane LOS values are based on average delay and v/c ratio (degree of saturation) per lane.
LOS F will result if v/c > irrespective of lane delay value (does not apply for approaches and intersection).
Intersection and Approach LOS values are based on average delay for all lanes (v/c not used as specified in HCM 2010).
Roundabout Capacity Model: US HCM 2010.
HCM Delay Model used. Geometric Delay not included.

Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay & v/c (HCM 2010).
Roundabout LOS Method: Same as Sign Control.
Lane LOS values are based on average delay and v/c ratio (degree of saturation) per lane.
LOS F will result if v/c > irrespective of lane delay value (does not apply for approaches and intersection).
Intersection and Approach LOS values are based on average delay for all lanes (v/c not used as specified in HCM 2010).
Roundabout Capacity Model: US HCM 2010.
HCM Delay Model used. Geometric Delay not included.

X: Not applicable for Continuous movement.

Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay & v/c (HCM 2010).
Roundabout LOS Method: Same as Sign Control.
Vehicle movement LOS values are based on average delay and v/c ratio (degree of saturation) per movement
LOS F will result if v/c > 1 irrespective of movement delay value (does not apply for approaches and intersection).
Intersection and Approach LOS values are based on average delay for all movements (v/c not used as specified in HCM 2010).
Roundabout Capacity Model: US HCM 2010.
HCM Delay Model used. Geometric Delay not included.

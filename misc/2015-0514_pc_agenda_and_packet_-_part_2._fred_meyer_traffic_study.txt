I.     INTRODUCTION

 Mackenzie presents this Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) to address the potential impacts of the
 proposed Fred Meyer fuel facility expansion in Newberg, Oregon. The site is located on the south side of
 Highway 99W between Springbrook Road and Brutscher Street. Figure 1 is a vicinity map indicating the
 project location.

 The subject property is zoned Community Commercial (C-2) in which the existing fuel facility was
 approved as a conditional use in September 2010; the current application represents an update to the
 prior conditional use approval. The prior approval was informed by our March 17, 2009 TIA and
 subsequent documents.

 Project Description

 The existing fuel facility provides 14 vehicle fueling positions (VFPs) at the west side of the Fred Meyer
 Newberg store near its driveway accessing Springbrook Road. The proposed expansion will add four
 VFPs by extending the canopy over two new fuel dispensers on the south side of the existing facility. No
 new driveways or changes to existing driveways are proposed. Construction is planned to occur in one
 phase, and completion is expected in 2015. Site plans prepared by Barghausen Consulting Engineers are
 provided in the Appendix for reference.

 Scope of Analysis

 This TIA addresses impacts of the proposed fuel facility expansion on the surrounding roadways, the
 Fred Meyer site driveways, and the Fred Meyer internal circulation system. Analyses are presented to
 address both City of Newberg and Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) requirements. Review
 includes local pedestrian and bicycle facilities, crash history, sight distance, intersection operation
 analysis, and intersection queuing. Specific attention is given to Phase 1 of the Newberg-Dundee Bypass
 Project, which is currently under construction and is anticipated to be complete in 2017. Additional
 analyses are presented to address local concerns raised during the original application process for the
 current fuel facility, including on-site circulation and fuel delivery truck operations.

 Traffic analyses are presented for the following two periods:
         Weekday PM Peak Hour
         Saturday Midday Peak Hour

 Traffic analyses are presented for the following four scenarios:
         2014 Existing
         2015 Pre-Development (without expansion)
         2015 Post-Development (with expansion)
         2017 Post-Development (with expansion) with Newberg-Dundee Bypass Phase 1 complete

 Traffic analyses are presented at the following study area intersections:
         Springbrook Road/Hayes Street
         Springbrook Road/Fred Meyer Driveway
         Highway 99W/Springbrook Road
         Highway 99W/Fred Meyer West (Right-In) Driveway
         Highway 99W/Fred Meyer East (Right-In Right-Out) Driveway
         Highway 99W/Brutscher Street
         Brutscher Street/Fred Meyer North Driveway

II.      EXISTING CONDITIONS

  Site Conditions

  The fuel facility occupies a portion of the overall Fred Meyer store site, located at 3300 Portland Road in
  Newberg, Oregon; and identified as tax lot 2004 in Section 16 of Township 3 South, Range 2 West of the
  Willamette Meridian on Yamhill County Assessor’s maps. Five other contiguous commercial
  developments share parking/circulation areas and roadway accesses with the Fred Meyer site; uses
  include a bank, fast food restaurants, an office/retail building, and a quick lubrication vehicle service
  shop.

  The existing fuel facility provides 14 vehicle fueling positions (VFPs) at the west side of the Fred Meyer
  store. Customer traffic flows one way (east to west) past the dispensers, and all vehicles are directed to
  turn left upon exiting the canopy area to circulate counterclockwise back to the north-south drive aisle
  between the fuel facility and the Fred Meyer store.

  The overall site accesses the public roadway system at six locations. Four of these driveway intersections
  are included in this TIA study area:
          Springbrook Road driveway (right-in/right-out only)
          Highway 99W West Driveway (right-in only)
          Highway 99W East Driveway (right-in/right-out only)
          Brutscher Street North Driveway (full movement)

  The two other site driveways provide full movement access to Brutscher Street and Little Oak Street.

  Transportation Facilities

  The following table summarizes the study area roadway classifications and characteristics, as identified
  by Mackenzie staff and as classified by the Newberg Transportation System Plan (June 2005), the 1999
  Oregon Highway Plan (revised through August 22, 2013), and the ODOT Functional Classification and
  National Highway System Status Table (as of October 2014).

All Fred Meyer site driveways are stop controlled. The Highway 99W intersections at Springbrook Road
and Brutscher Street are both signalized and allow U-turns along Highway 99W. The Fred Meyer on-site
intersections are all-way stop controlled, except the eastbound Main Drive Aisle approach to the East
Driveway (right-in/right-out) operates freely; this intersection is modeled as all-way stop controlled to
generate a configuration compatible with standard analysis methodologies.

Figure 2 presents the existing lane configurations and traffic controls at study area intersections.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities

Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are currently provided throughout most of the study area, including along
the entire Fred Meyer site frontage. The exception is a portion of Springbrook Road south of the Fred
Meyer site frontage where a separated paved path along the west side of the roadway provides the path
for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Transit Facilities

There are two bus services that provide transit service in the study area.

Yamhill County Transit Area (YCTA) operates three bus routes serving Newberg. Route 44 travels
between McMinnville and Tigard on Hwy 99W (46S on Saturdays), with a stop at Brutscher Street and
service between 1-2 hours during weekdays. Routes 5 and 7 serve the north and east ends of Newberg,
with stops every hour. Only route 7 stops at Fred Meyer. The operation schedules for the three routes
are located in the Appendix.

Traffic Volumes

Turning movement count data were collected at study area intersections during the weekday PM peak
period (4:00-6:00 PM) and during the Saturday midday peak period (11:00 AM-2:00 PM) on October
16th and 18th, 2014, respectively. The system peak hours were identified as 4:00-5:00 PM (weekday)
and 1:00-2:00 PM (Saturday) for this analysis. Copies of the data reports are provided in the Appendix.

In accordance with Chapter 5.4.1 of the ODOT Analysis Procedures Manual, Version 2 (APM v2), October
2014 Edition, a seasonal adjustment factor of 1.065 is applied to through and U-turn volumes along
Highway 99W. This adjustment is applied to estimate the 30th highest hour for the year, which typically
occurs during July or August in the Newberg vicinity. Details of the adjustment calculations and data
from Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) station 36-004 are provided in the Appendix.

Figures 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D present a summary of the system peak hour volumes: the volumes as
counted, the seasonal adjustments applied, and the adjusted existing intersection volumes.

Crash Analysis

Intersection Crash Analysis

When evaluating the relative safety of an intersection, consideration is given not only to the total
number and types of crashes occurring, but also to the number of vehicles entering the intersection.
This leads to the concept known as “crash rate,” typically expressed in terms of the number of crashes
occurring per one million vehicles entering the intersection (MEV). Intersections having a crash rate less



H:\Projects\214043600\WP\RPT-City of Newberg and ODOT-TIA-141121.docx                                        4
                                                                                                                                ATTACHMENT 4




      than 1.0 crashes/MEV are considered relatively safe. At crash rates higher than 1.0 crashes/MEV,
      consideration may be given to correcting operational problems.

      For this analysis, annual traffic entering each study area intersection is estimated by multiplying the
      average annual daily traffic (AADT) entering the intersection by 365. AADT is estimated by multiplying
      the intersection weekday PM peak hour total volume by a factor, a typical method of estimating daily
      traffic. The most recent ODOT ATR daily volume count (2013 data) on Highway 99W just west of
      Brutscher Street is approximately 11.4 times the recent (October 2014) PM peak count volumes, so a
      factor of 11.5 is applied to the seasonally adjusted 2014 intersection volumes as an approximation
      method for this area.

      Crash data for the study area intersections were obtained from the ODOT Zigzag data portal for the five-
      year period spanning January 2009 through December 2013. The following table presents calculated
      crash rates at the study intersections for the data period. Crash data are presented in the Appendix.

      All study area intersections have crash rates less than 1.0 crashes/MEV, so no further review is merited
      at these locations based on crash rates. A majority of crashes in the data set are coded as rear-end
      types, which are common at signalized intersections and difficult to mitigate. No fatalities are noted in
      the data set; the worst injury severity noted is “InjA – Incapacitating Injury,” which occurred twice in five
      years. A majority of crashes were “PDO – property damage only” with no reported injuries.

SPIS Review

ODOT maintains a Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) to identify the state highway segments exhibiting
the most severe safety needs. Specific to the study area for this analysis, two Highway 99W segments
are noted in the 2013 SPIS listing; a copy of the listing is provided in the Appendix. The following table
provides a summary of the relevant segments.

                                                               TABLE 3 – TOP 10% SPIS SEGMENTS

For reference, the Brutscher Street intersection is located at MP 21.80, and the Springbrook Road
intersection is located at MP 22.05. It is anticipated ODOT staff may identify crash patterns or safety
concerns within the study area, particularly within the identified SPIS segments, during TIA review. If this
occurs, the merits of potential mitigation measures will be addressed at that time.

III.     PRE-DEVELOPMENT CONDITIONS

   Future traffic conditions without the proposed fuel facility expansion are addressed as pre-development
   conditions. These include anticipated changes to intersection volumes and to roadway conditions.

   Background Growth

   General growth in traffic volumes not related to specific projects is termed background growth. Review
   of 2008-2013 data from the ODOT ATR 36-004 indicates traffic volumes have grown slowly—at less than
   1% per year—since the last economic downturn. ODOT Future Volume Tables, however, suggest a 2.1%
   annual growth rate is anticipated at ATR 36-004 from 2013 to 2033. As a conservative estimate, 2.0%
   background growth is applied to the adjusted existing intersection volumes to estimate 2015 pre-
   development volumes. Figures 4A and 4B presents background growth from 2014 to 2015 for a typical
   weekday PM peak hour and Saturday mid-day peak hour.

   In-Process Traffic

   Traffic volumes generated by approved projects not yet completed at the time of analysis is termed in-
   process traffic. One project, likely to add trips to the study area, was identified by City of Newberg staff
   is Springbrook Ridge Apartments, located at the northeast corner of the Springbrook Road/E 2nd Street-
   Fernwood Road intersection. Study area traffic for the project was estimated based on the September
   25, 2013, Traffic Impact Analysis prepared by Associated Transportation Engineering & Planning, Inc.;
   trip details from this TIA are provided in the Appendix.

   Figures 5A and 5B present the in-process trips for the current study area intersections. Saturday trips are
   estimated based on the Saturday peak hour of the generator regression equation provided for ITE Land
   Use Code 220 – Apartments. It is assumed 10% of the apartment trips traveled to and from the Fred
   Meyer store. The remaining trips traveling on Springbrook Road and Brutscher Street are distributed
   according to current traffic patterns.

   Planned Improvements

   The Newberg-Dundee Bypass Project, when fully completed, will shift through traffic away from the
   existing Highway 99W alignment. Construction funding and dates for the full bypass are uncertain, but
   Phase 1 of the project, from west Dundee to Highway 219 in Newberg, is under construction and is
   anticipated to be complete by 2017 according to ODOT staff estimates. The Bypass project will provide
   the following improvements within the TIA study area:

               At the Highway 99W/Springbrook Road intersection:
                       Add a second westbound left-turn lane
                       Add a second southbound receiving lane (for 300 feet)
                       Rebuild the traffic signal

               Along Springbrook Road between Highway 219 and Highway 99W:
                      Widen to a three-lane section
                      Provide a shared pedestrian-bicyclist path

   The City of Newberg 2013-2014 Capital Improvement Program (April 2013) does not identify any
   transportation projects funded for completion within the TIA study area and study analysis years.

Pre-Development Volumes

Pre-development volumes for 2015, the anticipated year of the fuel facility expansion, are the sum of
the adjusted existing volumes, background growth, and in-process traffic. Figures 6A and 6B present the
2015 pre-development traffic volumes.

IV.         SITE DEVELOPMENT

      The proposed development will expand the existing fuel facility from 14 to 18 vehicle fueling positions
      (VFPs). An extension of the canopy to the south to cover the additional fuel dispensers will result in a
      loss of five existing parking spaces; overall site parking minimums will still be met, however.

      Trip Generation

      Trip generation estimates for the proposed fuel facility expansion are prepared using average trip rates
      from Land Use Code 944 – Gasoline/Service Station in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE)
      Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (2012) and the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 3nd Edition (2014).
      Due to the nature of the fuel facility, no alternate trip modes are assumed. No large trucks are
      anticipated to use the fuel facility other than for fuel delivery.

      ITE estimates a fuel facility expansion of four VFPs will generate 674 additional weekday trips, including
      55 additional trips during the weekday PM peak hour.

      ITE does not provide Saturday data for Gasoline/Service Station (Code 944), so Saturday peak hour trips
      are estimated as 16% greater than the weekday PM peak hour trips. The percentage is based on 2002
      trip data from other Pacific Northwest Fred Meyer fuel facilities that indicated Saturday peak hour trip
      generation was approximately 16% greater than weekday PM peak hour trip generation. A copy of the
      Fred Meyer fuel facility trip data may be provided upon request. According to this factor, a fuel facility
      expansion of 4 VFPs will generate 64 Saturday peak hour trips.

      Trip Types

      ITE estimates the total number of vehicle trips to and from the fuel facility. Total trips are divided into
      internal, pass-by, diverted linked, and primary trips below.

      Fred Meyer stores offer a per-gallon discount on fuel purchases to Rewards Card Members. Trip data
      from Fred Meyer trip surveys indicate internal trip rates of 35% to 52% at fuel facilities sited adjacent to
      Fred Meyer stores. As a conservative estimate the internal trip rate is estimated as 20% of the total trips
      to match the value applied in our March 2009 TIA for the existing fuel facility.

      The percentages for the other trip types are determined based on Table F.36 of the ITE Handbook,
      specifically from the six surveys that include separate data for primary and diverted linked trips.
      Consistent with ITE procedures, the rates for pass-by, diverted linked, and primary trips are applied to
      the external trips remaining after subtracting the internal trips.

      The following summarizes the trip type splits applied to this analysis.

                                                                              TABLE 4 – TRIP TYPES

                                                                                                     External Trips
                       Trip Types:                        Internal Trips              Pass-By        Diverted Linked   Primary
                       % of Total Trips:                         20%                   41.6%              27.6%         10.8%
                       % of External Trips:                                             52%               34.5%         13.5%

      ITE provides trip type values only for the weekday AM and PM peak hours, so the weekday PM peak
      hour trip types are applied to the typical weekday and Saturday peak hour trip estimates.

                                                                                            ATTACHMENT 4




Internal Trips

In a development such as Fred Meyer, many customers take advantage of the multiple services and
retailers at the site in a single trip. These are known as shared or internal trips. For purposes of this
analysis, internal trips will remain on the Fred Meyer site and will not add to traffic volumes at site
driveways or on public roadways. As noted above, internal trips are estimated as 20% of the total trips.
The remaining 80% of the total trips are considered external trips because they add to traffic volumes at
or beyond site driveways.

Pass-By T rips

Pass-by trips are those site trips already driving past the site on the adjacent roadways. These trips do
not increase the total traffic volumes on the roadways, but do add to turning movement volumes at the
site accesses. A pass-by trip to other uses at the site that also stops at the fuel facility is considered an
internal trip. The ITE Handbook indicates an average pass-by percentage of 52% during the weekday PM
peak hour (calculated as noted above). This rate is applied to the Saturday midday peak hour as well.

The Fred Meyer site accesses Highway 99W, Springbrook Road, Brutscher Street, and Little Oak Street.
Existing volumes on Little Oak Street are much lower than those on the other roadways, and most
through traffic on Brutscher Street also travels on Highway 99W, so pass-by trips are assumed to be
drawn only from existing traffic volumes approaching the study area on Highway 99W and Springbrook
Road.

Diverted Linked Trips

Diverted linked trips are those site trips already traveling in the site vicinity on roadways other than
those immediately adjacent to the site. These vehicles change their direction or route to access the site.
The ITE Handbook estimates an average diverted linked trip rate of 34.5% during the weekday PM peak
hour. This rate is applied to the Saturday midday peak hour as well.

Parallel routes near the proposed fuel facility include Highway 219-E 1st Street, E 2nd Street-Fernwood
Road, Elliott Road, Providence Drive-Werth Boulevard, and Benjamin Road, so diverted linked trips could
be drawn from these roadways. However, because trips from any of these roadways would likely use
Highway 99W, Springbrook Road, or Brutscher Street to access the fuel site, diverted linked trips are
treated together with primary trips.

Primary T rips

Primary trips are those site trips stopping only at the fuel facility and then returning to their point of
origin. These are considered new trips generated by the expansion. The ITE Handbook indicates an
average pass-by percentage of 13.5% during the weekday PM peak hour (calculated as noted above).
This rate is applied to the Saturday midday peak hour as well. When treated together with the diverted
linked trips, the primary trips represent 48% of the external site trips.

Summary

The following table summarizes the trip generation estimates for the proposed Fred Meyer fuel facility
expansion from 14 to 18 VFPs.

The fuel facility expansion will generate 259 additional diverted linked+primary trips during a typical
weekday, including 21 additional diverted linked+primary trips in the weekday PM peak hour, and will
generate 24 additional diverted linked+primary trips during the Saturday midday peak hour.

Trip Distribution and Assignment

Trip distribution is addressed differently according to trip type. Note due to driveway movement
restrictions all external trip paths to/from the south are assumed to travel via Brutscher Street and/or
Hayes Street.

Internal Trips

Internal trips remain on the Fred Meyer site. Based on review of historical aerial imagery, a majority of
on-site vehicles park near the Fred Meyer store entrances, which are accessed from the Main Drive Aisle
between the West (Right-In Only) Access and the East (Right-In/Right-Out) Access intersections. All the
internal trips added with the proposed fuel facility expansion are assigned to travel to/from these
parking areas. Figures 7A and 7B present the internal trip assignments.

Pass-By T rips

The pass-by trips are distributed based on the proportions of traffic approaching the study area in the
October 2014 counts from four approaches:

        Westbound Highway 99W at Brutscher Street
        Southbound Springbrook Road at Highway 99W
        Eastbound Highway 99W at Springbrook Road
        Northbound Springbrook Road at the Fred Meyer Driveway

The weekday PM peak hour and Saturday midday peak hour distributions are both estimated as follows:

        45% from westbound Highway 99W
        15% from southbound Springbrook Road
        30% from eastbound Highway 99W
        10% from northbound Springbrook Road

Figures 8A and 8B present the pass-by trip distributions and assignments. Negative values identify
movements from which trips have been rerouted.

Primary T rips

Trip distribution for primary trips is based on previous studies prepared for the Newberg Fred Meyer
store and fuel facility. The distributions are estimated as follows:

        15% to and from the east on Highway 99W
        25% to and from the north on Springbrook Road
        35% to and from the west on Highway 99W
        25% to and from the south on Springbrook Road or Brutscher Street

Figures 9A and 9B present the primary trip distribution and assignments.

Total Trips

Figures 10A and 10B present the total trip impact anticipated with the proposed fuel facility expansion,
or the sum of internal trips, pass-by trips, and primary trips.

Post-Development Volumes

Post-development volumes for 2015, the anticipated year of the fuel facility expansion, are the sum of
the 2015 pre-development volumes and the total site trip assignment. Figures 11A and 11B present the
2015 post-development traffic volumes.

Post-develop volumes for 2017, the anticipated year of the Newberg-Dundee Bypass Project Phase 1
completion, are based on Figure 3A (2011 Existing Traffic Conditions) of the September 2011 Phase 1
Technical Report Addendum Memorandum by Kittelson & Associates, Inc., and Figure 7 (Year 2016
Phase 1 Scenario) of their July 2012 Analysis TIS. The reroute of traffic with the bypass is presented in
Figure 12, based on the difference in the volumes identified for the intersection of Highway 99W with
Springbrook Road.

The Kittelson memo addresses only weekday PM peak hour conditions, so Saturday conditions are not
addressed for 2017 scenarios. Figure 13 presents the 2017 post-development traffic volumes, which is
the addition of the reroute volume to Post-Development 2015 volumes.

V.         CIRCULATION EVALUATION

     Fuel Facility Circulation

     At the existing fuel facility customer traffic flows one way (east to west) past the dispensers, and all
     vehicles are directed to turn left upon exiting the canopy area to circulate in a counterclockwise fashion
     back to the Fuel Drive Aisle and then to the Main Drive Aisle. Customers are discouraged from using the
     loading area behind the Fred Meyer store as an alternative to the Main Drive Aisle. This circulation
     pattern is anticipated to continue with the proposed expansion.

     On-Site Intersections

     Traffic circulation for the fuel facility includes access on the Main Drive Aisle just west of the Fred Meyer
     store and across from the US Bank site. For purposes of this analysis, the Main Drive Aisle/US Bank/Fuel
     Drive Aisle intersection treats the Fuel Drive Aisle as intersecting opposite the nearest US Bank exit aisle
     and the only US Bank entry aisle. Due to the offset of the US Bank entry aisle, the eastbound left turn
     lane extends into the intersection, across the Fuel Drive Aisle. This intersection is all-way stop controlled
     to maintain low speeds and to rotate right-of-way among the approaching vehicles. As is shown in the
     Intersection Analysis section, delays at this intersection are currently well within the standard and are
     anticipated to remain so with the fuel facility expansion. No changes to the intersection configuration
     are proposed with the fuel facility expansion.

     When the current fuel facility was developed two pedestrian crosswalks between the US Bank and Fred
     Meyer store were added—one crossing the Main Drive Aisle and one crossing the Fuel Drive Aisle—as
     an alternative to the prior angled crosswalk through the middle of the Main Drive Aisle/US Bank/Fuel
     Drive Aisle intersection. These two newer crosswalks serve to reduce vehicles’ pedestrian delay and to
     provide a more predictable pedestrian route.

     When the current fuel facility was developed, the Main Drive Aisle/West (Right-In) Driveway
     intersection was modified to provide all-way stop control (the Main Drive Aisle previously moved freely)
     and to widen the southbound approach entering from Highway 99W. These improvements serve to
     maintain low speeds, to rotate right-of-way among the approaching vehicles, and to maintain lower
     delays and queues on the southbound approach than might otherwise occur. As is shown in the
     Intersection Analysis section, delays at this intersection are currently well within the standard and are
     anticipated to remain so with the fuel facility expansion. No changes to the intersection configuration
     are proposed with the fuel facility expansion.

     The Main Drive Aisle/East (Right-In/Right-Out) Driveway intersection currently operates with stop
     control on the two entering approaches (southbound from Highway 99W and westbound from
     Brutscher Street) while the exiting (eastbound) approach moves freely. This configuration was in place
     prior to the current fuel facility’s development and is not proposed to change with the fuel facility
     expansion. As is shown in the Intersection Analysis section, delays at this intersection are currently well
     within the standard and are anticipated to remain so with the fuel facility expansion. (Note a
     modification was required to generate results compatible with the analysis methodology.)

     Fuel Delivery Truck

     The fuel delivery truck currently circulates as shown on the two truck turning path exhibits by
     Barghausen Consulting Engineers (provided in Appendix A). The truck currently enters from the site
     driveway on Little Oak Street, arriving from Brutscher Street, and then travels through the loading area


     H:\Projects\214043600\WP\RPT-City of Newberg and ODOT-TIA-141121.docx                                           13
                                                                                           ATTACHMENT 4




behind the store to the fuel facility. Fuel delivery trucks exit through the same route. This route will be
maintained with the expansion, as it minimizes conflicts between pedestrians and customer vehicle
traffic.

Note the fuel delivery truck does not currently travel to/from south of the Fred Meyer site on Brutscher
Street, Hayes Street, or any other local residential roadways. The segment of Little Oak Street between
the Fred Meyer Driveway and Brutscher Street lies substantially within the contiguous Springbrook Oaks
Office Building commercial parcel, not within public right-of-way. Fuel deliveries currently occur
approximately once every two to three days, and no significant increase in delivery frequency is
anticipated with the proposed fuel facility expansion. While parked and offloading fuel, the delivery
truck may partially impede some vehicle fueling positions, as it does currently, but adequate width will
remain on all sides for circulation around the truck. Overall, with fuel deliveries taking place just a few
times per week, the impacts of the fuel truck will be negligible.

Access Review

The Fred Meyer site currently has six driveways: two on Highway 99W, one on Springbrook Road, two
on Brutscher Street, and one on Little Oak Street. No changes are proposed to any of the driveways with
the fuel facility expansion.

The West (Right-In) Driveway on Highway 99W is located approximately 465 feet east of Springbrook
Road, and the East (Right-In Right Out) Driveway is located approximately 490 feet west of Brutscher
Street, as measured between centerlines; the distance between the driveways is approximately 405
feet. Approach permits for both driveways are on file with ODOT. Both are limited to right turns by a
median and have right turn deceleration lanes on the highway.

The Springbrook Road driveway is located approximately 400 feet south of Highway 99W, as measured
between centerlines. Movements are limited to right turns by a median.

The North Driveway on Brutscher Street is located approximately 330 feet south of Highway 99W, as
measured between centerlines, opposite a driveway accessing Columbia Bank. All movements are
permitted.

Sight Distance Review

Our March 2009 TIA evaluated intersection sight distance at the three Fred Meyer exit driveway
locations analyzed in this current TIA. In all cases, available sight distance was identified as meeting or
exceeding the minimums recommended by the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials’ (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. No changes to
the driveway exits are noted since the time of the prior sight distance evaluation; only the posted speed
on Highway 99W appears to be different: previously it was 40 mph, and now it is 35 mph, for which a
lower sight distance minimum is recommended.

Evidence suggests intersection sight distance standards are met or exceeded at the Fred Meyer site
driveways. This assertion may be confirmed upon request.

VI.         INTERSECTION ANALYSIS

      Operations Analysis

      Intersection capacity calculations were prepared using methodologies presented in the Transportation
      Research Board’s Highway Capacity Manual 2000 Edition (HCM 2000). Trafficware’s Synchro software,
      Version 8, which implements HCM methodologies, was used to prepare the capacity and level-of-service
      calculations. Copies of the Synchro HCM reports are provided in the Appendix.

      Perfo rmance Mea sures and Standards

      The HCM generally assesses intersection capacity characteristics by three measures of effectiveness
      (MOEs): volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio, level of service (LOS), and control delay per vehicle (delay).

      V/c ratio is a measurement of the theoretical capacity used by a specific traffic volume or for an entire
      intersection. It is calculated as the traffic demand volume divided by the theoretical capacity.

      LOS is a relative measure of the average control delay (in seconds per vehicle) experienced by drivers at
      an intersection and is described by a letter on the scale from A to F. The HCM defines LOS grades
      according to delay thresholds. Qualitatively speaking, LOS A represents optimum operating conditions
      and minimum delay while LOS F indicates long delays and, often, over-capacity conditions.

      The City of Newberg uses LOS to evaluate intersection performance on city roadways. Table 5-1 of the
      Newberg Transportation System Plan (TSP), June 2005 Edition, indicates the operational standard for
      signalized intersections is LOS D and the operational standard for unsignalized intersections is LOS E. In
      addition, any intersection operating at or above capacity (i.e., with a v/c ratio equal to or greater than
      1.00) is considered to be operating unacceptably, even if the LOS standard is met.

      ODOT uses v/c ratio to assess capacity on state roadways. Table 6 of Policy 1F in the Oregon Highway
      Plan, as updated through December 21, 2011, provides the v/c standards outside the Portland
      metropolitan region. The study area intersections lie within the Newberg urban growth boundary (UGB)
      and along a Statewide Highway designated as a Freight Route with a posted speed of 35 mph, so the
      applicable ODOT target is a v/c ratio of 0.85. When the Newberg-Dundee Bypass Project is completed in
      the future, the Newberg TSP anticipates the current Highway 99W alignment will be classified as a
      District Highway (and, presumably, not a Freight Route), so the future ODOT v/c target is assumed to be
      0.95 for the study area intersections.

      Traffic Signals

      The Highway 99W traffic signals in the study area are owned and maintained by ODOT, and the
      Springbrook Road/Hayes Street intersection traffic signal is owned and maintained by the City of
      Newberg. Copies of the current signal plans and timings were obtained from agency staff and are
      provided in the Appendix. These current signal timing plans were applied to the Synchro analysis
      models. Optimized inputs were applied at the Springbrook Road/Hayes Street intersection in lieu of
      current timing plans, which were unavailable from the City at the time of this TIA issuance date.

      The Springbrook Road/Highway 99W and Brutscher Street/Highway 99W intersections in the 2017 Post
      Development were optimized to accommodate the change in traffic volumes caused by the proposed
      bypass project as well as the addition of a second westbound left turn lane.

The ODOT APM Version 2, October 2014 Edition, requires traffic analyses use the current edition of the
HCM (2010 in this case) unless otherwise specified in the APM. Chapter 2.5.1 notes HCM 2000
methodology may be used to produce intersection v/c ratios, which are not provided in HCM 2010
Synchro output reports. It is also noted the 2010 methodology does not model u-turns, and requires
modifications to detector loops ( (Typical ODOT detector templates for highway through lanes do not
include stop bar detection)For these reasons, the analysis has been prepared using HCM 2000
methodology in the Synchro and SimTraffic software program.

Analysis Reporting and Results

Operations analysis is presented for the following scenarios:
      2014 Existing
      2015 Pre-Development (without expansion)
      2015 Post-Development (with expansion)
      2017 Post-Development (with expansion) with Newberg-Dundee Bypass Phase 1 complete (PM
       only)

At signalized study area intersections the v/c ratio, LOS, and delay are reported for the overall
intersection. At unsignalized intersections the v/c ratio, LOS, and delay are reported for the critical
approach lane. Where standards are exceeded, discussion is provided in the following section. The
following table presents the operational analysis calculation results for the weekday PM peak hour.

All private on-site intersections and all study area intersections under City of Newberg jurisdiction are
anticipated to operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) in all analysis scenarios. The
Springbrook Road/Highway 99W intersection under ODOT jurisdiction, by contrast, is anticipated to
operate beyond acceptable v/c ratios in several analysis scenarios. Overall, however, the additional fuel
facility expansion trips have little impact on intersection capacity or delay, and all intersections will
operate well under capacity. With the by pass Phase 1 project, the v/c will be the same or better as 2015
Pre-Development conditions at the Highway 99 signalized intersections. It is also noted, the ODOT v/c
standard will be revised from 0.85 to 0.95 with the full by pass project.

Queuing Analysis

Intersection queuing was evaluated to estimate the queue demand for each signalized approach lane
along the Fred Meyer frontage and for the two Fred Meyer driveway entrances from Highway 99W. In
accordance with Chapter 2.5.1 of the ODOT APM v2, October 2014 Edition, queues were estimated
using a simulation software, specifically Trafficware’s SimTraffic Version 8, to model interactions among
signalized intersections within the study area. The SimTraffic 95th percentile queues during the 2015
and 2017 analysis scenarios are compared to the available storage.

The following tables present the available queue storage and the anticipated queue demand values for
the weekday PM peak hour and Saturday midday peak hour. Available storage is measured from recent

Springbrook Road at Highway 99W

The northbound approach of Springbrook Road to Highway 99W is currently striped for four lanes; two
left lanes, one through lane, and one right lane. The two left lanes have approximately 275 feet of
storage each, and the right lane has 195 feet of storage. The through lane provides approximately 300
feet of storage back to the Fred Meyer access.

The analysis indicates queue lengths for all Pre/Post Development lane group movements exceed
available storage for the weekday PM peak hour with the current ODOT signal timing. The Pre/Post
Development through movement queues for the weekday PM peak hour extends beyond the Fred

Meyer access. Therefore vehicles in the Fred Meyer driveway may need to wait for the queue to clear
before proceeding with right turns, which does not impact the public street operation.

With the addition of traffic on Springbrook Road with the Phase 1 By pass project, it is anticipated the
signal timing will be adjusted to provide more time for the northbound Springbrook Road approach,
such that vehicle queues will be significantly reduced. This is reflected in the table above.

Highway 99W at Brutscher Street

The eastbound approach along Highway 99W is currently striped for four lanes; one left lane, two
through lanes, and one right lane. The through lanes have approximately 365 feet of available storage.
The northbound approach is currently striped for two lanes; one left lane and one through/right turn
lane. Both northbound lanes have approximately 235 feet of storage. A Fred Meyer RIRO access is
located approximately 400 feet west of Brutscher Street.

Queuing analysis for all weekday PM peak hour and Saturday mid-day peak hour scenarios show
eastbound through and northbound left turn storage may be exceeded at times. The addition of fuel
expansion trips has little impact on these queues.

Main Drive Aisl e at West (Right -In) Drivewa y

The southbound right-in driveway approach is currently striped for one left turn lane and one turn right
lane. Both of these lanes have 80 feet of available storage and an additional 180 feet of storage from the
edge of the driveway crosswalk to the north to the point where the left and right turn lanes form.

The analysis indicates available storage for southbound left turning vehicles is adequate for all weekday
PM peak hour and Saturday mid-day peak hour scenarios.

Main Drive Aisl e at East (RIRO)

The RIRO driveway’s southbound approach is striped for a single left/right turn lane and has 210 feet of
available storage. This lane storage is adequate for all scenario queues.

VII.     SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   This Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) has been prepared to address the potential impacts of the
   proposed Fred Meyer fuel facility expansion in Newberg, Oregon. The site is zoned Community
   Commercial (C-2) in which the existing fuel facility was approved as a conditional use in September
   2010. The current application represents an update to the prior conditional use approval.

   The existing fuel facility provides 14 vehicle fueling positions (VFPs) at the west side of the Fred Meyer
   Newberg store near its driveway accessing Springbrook Road. The proposed expansion will add four
   VFPs by extending the canopy over two new fuel dispensers on the south side of the existing facility. No
   new driveways or changes to existing driveways are proposed. Construction is planned to occur in one
   phase, and completion is expected in 2015.

   This TIA addresses impacts of the proposed fuel facility expansion on the surrounding roadways, the
   Fred Meyer site driveways, and the Fred Meyer internal circulation system. Analyses are presented to
   address both City of Newberg and Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) requirements. Impacts
   are addressed for the weekday PM Peak Hour and Saturday Midday Peak Hour. Conditions with the
   Phase 1 By pass project are included for the PM Peak Hour, anticipated for 2017.

   The overall site accesses the public roadway system at six locations, four of which will typically be used
   by fuel facility customers. The two other site driveways provide full movement access to Brutscher
   Street and Little Oak Street. All Fred Meyer site driveways are stop controlled. The Fred Meyer on-site
   intersections are all-way stop controlled, except the eastbound Main Drive Aisle approach to the East
   Driveway (right-in/right-out) operates freely.

   Sidewalks and bicycle lanes are currently provided throughout most of the study area, including along
   the entire Fred Meyer site frontage. The exception is a portion of Springbrook Road south of the Fred
   Meyer site frontage where a separated paved path along the west side of the roadway provides the path
   for pedestrians and bicyclists. Yamhill County Transit Area (YCTA) operates three bus routes serving
   Newberg, with Routes 44 and 7 providing service at or adjacent to Fred Meyer.

   Turning movement count data were collected at study area intersections during the weekday PM peak
   period (4:00-6:00 PM) and during the Saturday midday peak period (11:00 AM-2:00 PM) on October 16
   and 18, 2014, respectively. The system peak hours were identified as 4:00-5:00 PM (weekday) and 1:00-
   2:00 PM (Saturday) for this analysis. These volumes were adjusted in accordance with ODOT procedures
   to estimate the 30th highest hour for the year, which typically occurs during July or August in the
   Newberg vicinity.

   Crash data for the study area intersections were obtained from ODOT for the five-year period spanning
   January 2009 through December 2013. All study area intersections have crash rates less than 1.0
   crashes/MEV, so no further review or mitigation is merited. A majority of crashes in the data set are
   coded as rear-end types, which are common at signalized intersections and difficult to mitigate.

   Future traffic conditions without the proposed fuel facility expansion are addressed as pre-development
   conditions, and include background growth at 2% per year plus in-process trips added to existing traffic
   volumes. Only one in-process project was noted by City staff: Springbrook Ridge Apartments, located at
   the northeast corner of the Springbrook Road/E 2nd Street-Fernwood Road intersection.

   The Newberg-Dundee Bypass Project, when fully completed, will shift through traffic away from the
   existing Highway 99W alignment. Construction funding and dates for the full bypass are uncertain, but


   H:\Projects\214043600\WP\RPT-City of Newberg and ODOT-TIA-141121.docx                                        20
                                                                                             ATTACHMENT 4




Phase 1 of the project, from west Dundee to Highway 219 in Newberg, is under construction and is
anticipated to be complete by 2017 according to ODOT staff estimates. The Phase 1 Bypass project will
modify the Highway 99W/Springbrook Road intersection by adding a second westbound left-turn lane,
second southbound receiving lane (for 300 feet) and rebuilding the traffic signal. No changes are
proposed to other study area intersections that would affect the capacity or operation. Conditions in the
PM peak hour for the 2017 condition with Phase 1 of the Bypass project are analyzed, and found to be
within acceptable levels.

The proposed expansion of the fuel facility from 14 to 18 vehicle fueling positions (VFPs) is estimated to
generate 674 additional weekday trips, including 55 additional trips during the weekday PM peak hour,
and 64 Saturday peak hour trips. More than half of the trips visiting the fuel facility are expected to be
from vehicles already at the Fred Meyer site or driving by on adjacent roadways.

With the fuel facility expansion, customer traffic flows will continue to be one way (east to west) past
the dispensers, and all vehicles are directed to turn left upon exiting the canopy area to circulate in a
counterclockwise fashion back to the Fuel Drive Aisle and then to the Main Drive Aisle. Customers are
discouraged from using the loading area behind the Fred Meyer store as an alternative to the Main
Drive Aisle. This circulation pattern is anticipated to continue with the proposed expansion.

All on-site intersections and driveways to the public streets are anticipated to continue operating at
acceptable levels with the fuel expansion, and no changes to the intersection configurations are
proposed.

The fuel delivery truck currently enters the site at the driveway on Little Oak Street, arriving from
Brutscher Street, and then travels through the loading area behind the store to the fuel facility. Fuel
delivery trucks exit through the same route. This route will be maintained with the expansion, as it
minimizes conflicts between pedestrians and customer vehicle traffic. Fuel delivery trucks do not
currently travel to/from south of the Fred Meyer site on Brutscher Street, Hayes Street, or any other
local residential roadways.

Intersection capacity calculations were prepared using methodologies presented in the Transportation
Research Board’s Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 Edition (HCM 2000), and Trafficware’s Synchro
software, Version 8, which implements HCM methodologies. The City of Newberg uses LOS to evaluate
intersection performance on city roadways, with the operational standard for signalized intersections a
LOS D and the operational standard for unsignalized intersections a LOS E. ODOT uses v/c ratio to assess
capacity on state roadways, with a ratio of 0.85 for this segment of Highway 99W. When the Newberg-
Dundee Bypass Project is completed in the future, the Newberg TSP anticipates the current Highway
99W alignment will be classified as a District Highway, so the future ODOT v/c target is assumed to be
0.95 for the study area intersections.

The intersection of Highway 99W at Springbrook Road currently exceeds ODOT’s 0.85 v/c standard, and
will continue to do so with the addition of trips from the fuel facility and will the Phase 1 Bypass project.
Overall intersection operation is still at a level of service D, and well under capacity, so meets the City of
Newberg operational standards. With the full Bypass project, the reduction in traffic volumes and
change to the ODOT standard are expected to result in operation meeting ODOT standards. For these
reasons, no mitigation is recommended.

Intersection queuing was evaluated in accordance with ODOT standards utilizing Trafficware’s SimTraffic
Version 8, with 95th percentile queues reported. Queues at the Springbrook Road northbound approach
to Highway 99W currently exceed the available storage lengths with the existing ODOT timing, but the


H:\Projects\214043600\WP\RPT-City of Newberg and ODOT-TIA-141121.docx                                            21
                                                                                            ATTACHMENT 4




addition of site trips have little impact on the queue lengths. These queues lengths can be reduced with
signal timing modifications, and will likely occur with the planned ODOT improvements with the Phase 1
Bypass project.

Queues on the eastbound Highway 99W approach to Brutscher Street extend beyond the existing Fred
Meyer driveway. Because this is a right turn exit, vehicles will simply need to wait for queues to clear
before entering the Highway. On the Brutscher Street approach to Highway 99W, vehicle queues are
expected to occasionally extend to the first Fred Meyer driveway, but the addition of fuel facility trips
will have little impact on the queue lengths.

Based on our analysis, the addition of fuel facility expansion trips will have little impact on the operation
and queuing at study area intersections. No mitigation measures are recommended.

SCENARIO 2 – PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

Under this scenario, the entire site would be developed as R3 Multifamily Apartments which would be
comprised of 120 units. For the purposes of this report the total development of the site was considered.
This was done to show as near as possible the total impact of the development on the surrounding street
system.

TRIP GENERATION
Estimates of total daily peak hour driveway volumes for the existing uses were developed from empirical
observations at many similar-sized facilities located throughout the United States. These empirical
observations are summarized in a standard reference manual published by the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition and the procedures and data provided in the ITE Trip
Generation Handbook.

Estimating the number of vehicle trip ends that will be generated by the proposed development is of prime
importance in order to accurately assess the impacts of development on the road network.

The figures shown in Table 4 below, represent the expected number of vehicle trip ends to be generated by
the proposed development on a daily p.m. peak hour basis based on the mathematical regression equations
found in Section 220 of the Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition). This development is expected to
generate approximately 851trips per day

            Land Use                                 Size                        Peak Hour
                                                                                Entry      Exit

For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that none of the home related person trips will be made by
mass transit. This assumption ignores the recent statewide projections that 4-6 percent of all home based
person trips for purposes unrelated to work will be made by transit. Therefore, this assumption tends to
cause the analysis to reflect a worst-case condition, and over estimate the traffic impacts associated with this
development.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION


The trip distribution for this report was determined from the traffic volumes shown in the field observation
and review of the Phase 1 Technical Report Addendum, Kittelson & Associates, Inc., September 2011. See
Figure 6.

the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate. Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property

the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate. Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property

the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate. Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property

the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate.

the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate. Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property

the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate. Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property

Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property

Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property
damage only crashes being eligible for inclusion in the Statewide Crash Data File.

the responsibility of the individual driver, the Crash Analysis and Reporting Unit can not guarantee that all qualifying crashes are represented nor can assurances be made that all details pertaining to a single crash are accurate. Note: Legislative changes to DMV's vehicle crash reporting requirement, effective 01/01/2004, may result in fewer property

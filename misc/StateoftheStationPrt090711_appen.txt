Appendix C ­ Public Outreach and Open House Summary
Sound Transit and URS hosted a series of six public open house events to secure feedback to
help inform possible future investments by Sound Transit at eight of its Sounder Commuter Rail
stations.

The objectives of the open houses were to:

         Generate awareness about the Study among target audiences

         Encourage public participation.

         Generate feedback that will help ensure future changes to the station are reflective of
         the individual needs of each community.

In total, 172 individuals attended public meetings and left 99 original comment forms. In
addition, 11 comments were mailed in after the event. The total number of comments (many
comment forms had multiple comments) was 245. Comments were also received from Pierce
Transit (see Attachment 1).

Each station has its own particular issues and touch points, for some its parking and others
bicycle/pedestrian access. Similar themes for all stations had to do with more service hours and
better connections with Pierce Transit. Outlined below is an overview of the feedback both in
terms of comment forms and in comments provided at the aerial map station staffed by URS
and/or Transpo; a more detailed summary of specific feedback received at each event follows.

Access

         The future Highline-Midway station will need access across I-5 at 240th. I will encourage
         usage by the West Hill neighborhood and allow walkers to take the light rail.

         No shuttle for everyone along platform, need traffic cops when train arrives ­ backup on
         lights

         The traffic is horrible. I've requested from the city for there to be traffic cops and I was
         told there is no problem. The train arrives at Kent at 4:39 and it can take until 5 just to
         get to Central. That is ridiculous! A skybridge or traffic cop is needed there.

         The crossing signal at Smith Street seems to have constant problems ­ it takes a long
         time for it to stop after Sounder leaves. Something to report to Burlington Northern

         See packet of suggestions (attached at the end of this section, beginning on pg. 13)

         The signals at Smith St. and Second Ave don't detect bikes very well. There should be a
         traffic light with good detectors at Smith St. and Railroad Ave. The bike lanes on James
         St should be extended to the East at least to Central Ave. In Auburn, cyclists cannot trip
         the lights on A St NW and A ST SW to cross Main St. Cyclists on Main St cannot trip the
         lights at C St. At the Tukwila station it is very important to maintain the connection to
         the North and East to Renton. Currently Longacres drive is used but I don't know if that
         road will continue to exist.

         At the future Midway station it will need a 240th bridge over I-5 to connect West Hill
         neighborhood for walking or driving.

         Provide signal at Railroad Ave and Smith St

         Provide better crossing of tracks at each end of the platform, such as more of a shoulder
         for bicycles (north side of Smith St and on James St)

         Provide better signal trip at Smith and 2nd Ave for bicycles, especially in the northbound
         direction (for example an "X" or "T" marker/symbol in the pavement for cyclists to put
         their crank over to activate the signal)

         Extend bike lanes eastbound James St just west of 1st Ave N to Railroad Ave N
         (understand that the cold storage building cannot move, but look at sidewalk and
         roadway)

         Provide bike lanes westbound James St from Interurban Train and under SR 167 to
         Washington

         Move the fire hydrant where we want to start bike lanes on James St (next to Kent
         Station development and the wide sidewalk area).

         Sharrows: eastbound on Pioneer from Railroad Ave then on right-of-way (now a dirt
         path between the parking lot), bridge over Mill Creek to Temperance St, turn onto Jason
         to cross Smith St at Jason/Titus.

         Provide sharrows: on Pioneer to State Ave to Gowe to 6th to Interurban Trail

         Provide crosswalk on Smith St at Railroad Ave ­ it is currently dangerous for pedestrians

Parking

         Not enough parking at Kent Station, lately the garage is always full in you're not there by
         8AM.

         Kent garage has no ownership ­ BAD driving, etc; vanpool drivers use regular parking
         spots instead of reserved ones. Why can't commuters park on surface lots? We share
         garage with shoppers; large vehicles block view in garage ­ need special area

         Light Rail: Increased parking at Int'l Blvd. Station;

         Sounder: The main issue, although there are many, is the garage. I park @ Kent station
         and the garage is horrible. The design is too narrow and the change to one way from
         two way causes you to double back every other row. Oversize vehicles make it difficult
         to back out and to see, especially on the ramps. The garage is full before the last 2 trains
         come. It is full before 8AM. The garage is also not safe. My car has been hit 2x and I
         know of other accidents and break-ins. In addition, van pools park in regular spots but
         there are numerous van pool reserved spots.

         Trying to exit the parking garage in the evening is very challenging ­ you usually sit
         through several lights before making it to Smith St.; I only use this garage when Auburn
         garage becomes too full and hectic; I love riding the train but the parking becomes a rat
         race stressor. Willing to pay $30/month for covered guaranteed parking spot

         Parking is limited.

         Congestions getting into garage in the morning can be time consuming. Granted it is
         usually closer you get to train time, but arriving can be aggressive when trying to find a
         parking spot. 2) Parking, at least for the 7:23AM NB train seems to be adequate (usually
         park on level 4 or 5) but later train have issues. I will park at Kent if Auburn station is full
         or if I know I cannot make it to the top of Auburn garage and back down again if garage
         is full. 3) It seems like parking has been more full over the last few months...maybe due
         to Russell moving from Tacoma to Seattle? This also effects the Auburn garage as well as
         the Sumner location not having adequate parking.

         Parking is the big issue for me. If you take the later morning Sounders, the lots and
         garage are full. Kent Station shopping center security threatens to tow your car. So
         there is not a lot of choices. This will be especially important if mid-day Sounders are
         added.

         Security ­ last month my vehicle was broken into and the station. Since then I have
         noticed signs of other cars being broken into just about every day. I have never seen a
         police or security officer patrolling the parking lots or garage. Video cameras need to be
         placed in the parking lots and garage.

         More parking! The lots and garage are full if you try to ride the late Sounders. I like the
         small park and ride lots around the station better than garage

Schedule / Service

         Not enough trains South-line each day. Need more in the morning and more in the
         evening. If you work downtown until 6 there is no train home. I am currently in the
         market to buy a home, but if the transportation isn't available I won't be able to live this
         far south, with my new work schedule.

         More trains midday-stuck downtown; coordinate buses @ King Street ­ 2 min late no
         buses won't wait

         Sounder: Daytime trains-10AM, 12PM, 2PM, RT-Tacoma to Everett and Everett to
         Tacoma

         Once you get downtown Seattle you are tapped. There are no trains in the middle of the
         day if you need to leave early. You also cannot stay late because there are no late trains.
         There is no coordination with the buses. Every morning while we wait at the crosswalk
         at King Street, buses just leave. If the train is late you can be left 10 plus minutes waiting
         for the next bus.

         Need more trains around the populate times (i.e. 5:12PM train); mornings extremely
         crowded between Kent and Tukwila

         As the sounder becomes more popular again (economic recovery, gas prices increase..)
         finding a seat becomes a challenge on some trains; Reminders to not have people put
         feet on the seats; Remind people to not place their bags on the seats to provide all
         available seat;

         I live in Seattle but work in Kent, at the Regional Justice Center. The last train that
         departs Seattle for Kent leaves at 6:50AM. That is not a convenient time. If just one
         more train left Seattle for Kent, maybe 1/2 an hour later, you would see a great increase
         in ridership. I know a lot of employees at the RJC who live in Seattle but drive to Kent,
         because the train leaves too early

         I have noticed signage encouraging light rail users to make use of the space for hanging
         bikes to store luggage. There is no virtue in encouraging this practice, even though it
         may be allowed, when many riders would keep their luggage with themselves anyway.
         The signs alerting cyclists that they may stand with their bikes are much smaller and not
         so easily noticed.

         The straps in place to hold bicycle wheels - front and back - on the trains, need to be
         replaced. They are too short, making it difficult to get around both wheels, especially if
         two bikes ride side by side. The strap buckle pass-through is too narrow, making it
         difficult to install. Last, the Velcro is well worn.

Station

         Need more Orca tappers- must backtrack when exiting train;

         Besides the garage, there is no shelter from the rain. There also need to be more
         tappers. Waiting in line to tap takes time and is horrible in the rain. Tapping on and off
         ONLY applies to the train. No other mode (busers) has to do this. This is discriminating.

         More locations to tap on and off using the ORCA card.

         Tukwila station: invest some money into station; it has slippery walkways. Not very
         much covered area for passengers waiting for train.

         The elevators for the pedestrian walk-over are terrible. They are always breaking down,
         or are vandalized by the kids that hang around. The police (city and transit) presence has
         fallen off in the evenings. This has resulted in a lot more large groups of kids hanging out
         and more "suspicious" activity happening in the alley behind the Chevron station at
         James and Central. I park in the lot there sometimes and I am nervous returning to my
         car in the evening. My number 2 issue is lack of shelter from the rain on the Sounder
         platform. The current shelters are too small and inadequate for the number of people
         waiting for the train. Most of us are there at least 10 min before the train arrives and 10
         minutes in the pouring rain is not pleasant.

         Great work adding bike lockers!

         Shelters ­ it rains in Seattle. Cover the waiting areas of the train station.

         It would make a more comfortable commute if the platform were covered. The Kent
         platform is not only narrow but is mostly uncovered and when the rains fall (which is
         most of the year) everyone is either huddled under the two covers or just stand in the
         rain. The station includes benches along the platform but they are unusable most of the
         year when it rains. I would think a general cover along the entire platform would be
         more useful than the very artistic two covers that currently serve the Kent platform.

Communication

         Email notices come after the fact-too late.

         The email notices are too late. For example, for late trains 1/14-2/11 was sent on 1/21!
         Notices are usually sent over 30min afterwards- too late.

Route

         Train from Renton to Bellevue/Woodinville

Miscellaneous

         I enjoy riding the train when I do. It's clean, fast, and a pleasant way to travel.

Parking

         Trying to find a parking spot in the morning is extremely stressful ­ drive all the way to
         the top to find out the garage is full ­ usually forced to drive to work then. I was paying
         Auburn f

         or a guaranteed spot in the garage - $50/month. I thought it was a little expensive ­
         willing to pay $30/month. As soon as Auburn spots opened up the garage exceeded
         capacity within 3 days. This needs to be treated like a system. When Sumner doesn't
         provide parking those residents are forced to Auburn which puts Auburn at capacity and
         pushes Auburn people to Kent. Sumner needs to provide sufficient parking for their
         residents. Small park and ride lots with shuttle access would help, i.e. Lakeland Hills. I
         love riding the Sounder but the parking situation needs to be addressed. It is becoming
         very stressful and dangerous as people race to find spots in the morning.

         More parking ­ whether it be multiple level parking garage or adding to current garage
         (don't know if structurally this is possible); Parking attendant or electronic notification
         stating garage is full, rather than going to top floor only to find out all spots are full;
         Pave and line gravel lot for those who pay to park in this lot.

         Auburn desperately needs a 2nd commuter parking garage. Commuters are parking
         along the tracks and other parts of DT neglecting impacting parking for local businesses,
         residents and visitors (shoppers) in Auburn.

         We really need more parking at the Auburn parking garage that is free. I heard we were
         going to get another garage and now I hear we are not. How can people use the train if
         they cannot park their car? You are only doing half the task at hand.

         There is not enough parking! Overflow goes onto neighboring property that is being
         developed which creates negative impact on businesses whose parking is taken up by
         people who aren't visiting their locations. Please give Auburn what they need ­
         improved parking with second garage.

         There is NOT currently enough parking. Right now commuters are parking in the empty
         building lots. Those will soon have construction going on and there will be no more
         "overflow" parking available. The citizens voted "Yes" with the premise and promise of a
Sounder Stations Flexible Access Study ­ Appendix C                                                    19

         2nd garage to be built with the money collected. Pleas respect the vote of the people
         and BUILD the 2nd garage.

         We will and soon need more parking. Lets start planning now!

         A second parking garage is needed in Auburn. It was understood that would be in ST-2.
         We pushed for its passage because of the promise of the garage. When you add more
         trains this need will grow.

         We serve 50-100 students a day at the Auburn station. It is great for the college and for
         economic development in the city. PARKING will be a huge issue for our students once
         the development around the Auburn station is complete (2-3 years). If our students
         cannot park in the surrounding area we will be forced to close programs that are vital to
         the Auburn community

         I am David Comstock, owner of Comstock's Binding and Bookshop. My main complaint is
         after years of promises Sound Transit has betrayed Auburn by refusing to build our 2nd
         parking garage except in the far distant future. However, you have greatly increased
         ridership while denying YOUR parking on our already stressed downtown. Your empty
         promises go back many years and many, many of us voted the last election to give you
         more funds and you made us promises to build our garage. Bellevue, which doesn't
         seem to really want light rail will get whatever they want, at whatever price, I venture.
         Fulfill your promises!

         With future development in Auburn another garage will benefit the overall
         transportation/parking in the downtown area.

         the Auburn parking facility is also full by early morning

         Additional parking will be required as well. The current parking garage is at capacity. If
         the construction allows for additional parking floors to be added, that should be
         considered now. If not, then an additional parking garage should be designed with
         future growth in mind (not only growth of current passenger capacity, but also growth
         of the population in the immediate future). The same 3 entities (City of Auburn, Sound
         Transit, and Metro Transit) should start negotiating now to determine the respective
         funding sources and percentages.

         Additional parking is needed.

         Need more parking and buses to get people to station so they don't need to park.
         Additional parking must be as close to the current station as the existing parking

         Parking IS a big problem in DT Auburn from existing commuters parking where they
         should not (on private property) and when they should not (outside of posted hours &

Sound Transit URS Team
         in 2hr zones.) If you want increased ridership, you need parking. The current lack of
         parking turns away potential riders and causes current riders to violate private property.

         Free up stalls in the garage that the City of Auburn has taken. Would like to see second
         garage, have it on west side of tracks. Parking IS an issue!

         We NEED more parking in the garage that is free. You want people to use public
         transportation, but if there is no where to park it doesn't do any good.

         Downtown merchants are unhappy about parking (a) spill-over parking from sounder
         station, and (b) uncertainty and suspicion that parking problems will only be
         exacerbated by upcoming plans to re-develop downtown blocks near station (as the
         Comp Plan encourages).

         There's a consistent perception that a second parkin g garage was included in the ST2
         funding measure.

         Perception than many Auburn station users are non-Auburn residents ­ need to fully
         document passenger survey and note/map station user's point of origin, by station.

         Recommendation to start charging current park-and-ride users to help pay for second
         parking structure.

Schedule / Service

         As the popularity increases, seating is becoming an issue on some trains.

         In regards to seating, have security or train conductors walk through cars reminding
         passengers to store backpacks, bags, etc under seat or in overhead; announcement is
         not enough due to passengers wearing headphones

         Have a car that allows dogs on leashes (owners should have to get pre-approval

         Keep bus 497 from Lakeland Hills

         Please add a mid-day train.

         RTE 578 is a great addition. However, I suggest that inbound be routed over Safeco. Exit
         down 4th with a stop at King Street then proceed to University.

         It seems that the commuter rail services is quite successful, so much so that it is now
         capacity-constrained. The trains are "standing room only" NB from Auburn. If the
         commuter rail service is to improve and expand, additional cars will need to be added to
         the train (extensions of the boarding area will need to be made, or access to the
         additional seating capacity will need to be through an adjacent passenger car).

         More trains for special events (around the clock); 3) More trains in the evenings; 4) Add
         cars to accommodate more people per run ­ thus, expand loading area'

         More runs to and from Seattle.

         Poorly-timed local bus transfers to commuter rail was reported by several.

Station

         On a positive note, the train staff, especially the woman in the morning with dark curly
         hair is extremely helpful at the Auburn station. She can help with anything and usually is
         helping new riders or those having difficulties with equipment i.e. kiosk;

         Additional ORCA readers should be placed at 2nd floor and bottom of stairway at
         parking garage to east congestion when people get off train. This will provide more "tap
         off" locations.

         Have rider drop-off areas that don't allow the drive to "park" until the riders train
         arrives, taking space that others need. 9) Secure bicycle storage is essential. Buses also
         need to be able to accommodate bikes quickly as people may ride a long way just to get
         to a bus ( and/or put secure bike parking at key bus stops);

Access

         Work with local partners on better bicycle signage from Interurban train to transit
         center.

         Traffic- it needs to favor ridership trying to get to parking.

Communication

         Tell us how to petition the legislature to get (you) more funding (will contact
         transportation choices coalition. Tell us your criteria for re-assessing how existing $$ will
         be spent so we can provide info to you that is to the point.

Miscellaneous

         A number of employers reimburse employee transportation expenses, including driving.
         Get them on board for supporting public transportation.

Parking

         The most effective yet expensive solutions to both the safety and parking issues would
         be to add a parking garage across Traffic Ave with pedestrian walk-area. Having a
         parking garage would give commuters a close, safe place to park as well as easy access
         over Traffic Ave and access to either set of tracks.

         Please add more parking. I don't mind walking a ½ mile to the transit station. It would
         just be nice to have a safe place to park.

         Please add parking in Sumner.

         More parking or garage near Sumner Station; Permits for Sumner residents to park in
         restricted areas

         More parking is needed at Sumner.

         A garage just needs to be well designed to mitigate/minimize the large volume of the
         building and make it visually interesting.

         Sumner station needs parking and an overpass. A parking garage, perhaps with shops on
         the ground floor would be best. By the 3rd or 4th train, parking is very hard to find.

         A parking garage would be a nice addition.

         Biggest problem is lack of parking at Sounder Station in Sumner and parking lot across
         the street [State/Hunt] is NOT safe-dark and gravel/not paved lot makes it unsafe to
         walk. As a woman I don't feel safe using it. Let's get creative ideas to build a parking lot
         that complements the area-perhaps with lights and make it closer to the station.

         Acquire enough property to accommodate a parking garage between station LN and
         railroad track.

         I drive from Orting to catch the train in Sumner and always have to park several blocks
         away on the street. At least 50-100 more stalls are needed. Garage is the best option by
         far. As most riders are northbound, it should be in current location of parking lot to
         avoid most people having to cross Traffic Ave and tracks.

         Parking solution: Build a parking garage at or near Sumner tracks.

         Sound Transit parking lots are being used by more than just Sound Transit. Somehow
         there needs to be designated for ST commuters. Today at the first train home there
         were over 40 stalls empty- but were full in the morning. Construction workers were all
         catching a ride in company truck to work but parking in Sound Transit lot.

         Please add more parking. I am willing to walk ½ mile. Parking does not need to be close.

         Build a garage in location of main lot with at least 50-100 more stalls.

Schedule / Service

         Lastly, I would like to see more runs added. We have lived in Sumner for 5 ½ years and
         the only lines added have been beneficial to commuters. Especially in the summer, my
         family would use the Sounder a lot going to both Seattle and Tacoma. Please consider
         asking B.N for more time on the tracks. I think all cities that are connected by the
         Sounder would benefit greatly and it would also keep more people and cars off the
         road-better for parking in the cities and better for the environment!

         I would not mind taking Pierce Transit 408 if the schedules were more in sync. I take the
         7.37am train and PT-408 arrives at 7:36am. It is too risky to take the bus because I could
         miss the train. Also when I come home, the 408 leaves a good 15 minutes after the train
         arrives. This is too much time wasted sitting in the Sound Transit parking lot. Please
         make the 408 route more useful by syncing up arrival and departure times with the
         Sounder train.

         Add one more train to leave Sumner around 9AM.

         Have a later train from Seattle to Tacoma- have time after work to shop, go out for a
         drink or dinner.

         Train and Bus communications: When trains are late, they need ability to notify buses
         that could wait.

         Also sync the ST-408 bus schedule with the train.

Station

         Please keep the station and improve it where it is. I bought my house in downtown
         Sumner because of its proximity to the station and consider it to be a huge asset. A
         garage would maybe work if designed extremely well.

         There needs to be a way people can know what side the train is on.


Sounder Stations Flexible Access Study ­ Appendix C                                               24

         Noticed occasionally on returned southbound trips the Sounder uses the Westbound
         tracks which seems "disjointed" for the passengers departing from the train. Those
         picking up passengers create a traffic issue on Traffic Ave.

         My husband has had to RUN many times when he's been standing on the platform and
         the train is on the other track. It would also be nice to take advantage of the electronic
         signage that could be used to warn commuters ahead of time that there has been a
         change.

         Should be a bathroom/San-I-can so they don't do it in the cabana.

Access

         Where the crossbar comes down is not a safe place to cross at the present time also. A
         parking garage with pedestrian cross areas would solve a lot of problems. There is
         currently no ADA access.

         Connecting the station to the trail along the Puyallup River would be great for walking
         and biking.

Route

         New stop where Sounder crosses Link Light Rail, near Boeing Access Road

         Would take the bus to station if service to Orting was provided.

Miscellaneous

         Maintenances should keep landscaping/weeding up better. Shouldn't operate leaf
         blowers at 10:30 or 11:00 PM at night. When they pressure wash station
         sidewalks/facilities they shouldn't let it run down storm drains (EPA wouldn't approve),
         also should do it during days or on weekends.

         I am glad you came

Parking

         There is not nearly enough parking at the downtown train station- this discourages
         people from riding.

         Remote parking with shuttle bus is not effective ­ people want to park at the station.

         More parking needed at Puyallup station

         Try and get a refund from the WWF for Sound Transit's share at the Red Lot. Purchase
         land (old oil company property or Eagles Club) demolish the structures for additional
         parking.

         More parking

         Parking garage! Red Lot-Improve usage. Dedicated shuttle, like airport parking

         Parking fills up at 5:47AM train

         There is a clear impact on long-term parking for the merchants. The original promises of
         NO impact on downtown (by John Hubbard) have never been kept. Puyallup needs
         multiple locations for merchant parking. This means going to permit (or zone) parking.
         One large parking structure in town is NOT the solution because of traffic. P.T.O.

         Do not want to see a parking garage. You need to offset people coming to this lot not try
         to bring more in. Puyallup and its residents are going away and becoming a parking lot
         and only a 6hr town.

         With expansion we need a park and ride south of tracks; parking garage should be closer
         to high school to move commuter traffic away from downtown; School district willing to
         explore shared use of parking garage.

         Think we need a parking garage but do need to be sensitive to the neighborhood.

         A parking building would be nice too!

         More parking, more parking, more parking! Garage. Keep close tabs on real estate
         available close to station for parking

         Wish there was more easily accessible parking. Having to walk so far makes me less
         likely to ride. I ride the last train in the AM

         Sounder riders are parking on Main Ave, 3rd and 4th Streets even before the lot fills
         (because it is quicker to get out at the end of the day), Its dark, not enough parking lot
         lighting and often poorly time with day light savings time; A parking garage is not the
         answer

         Puyallup District may go to middle school program so 9th graders may move to the high
         school near the station; increase school population from ~1,600 to ~1,900+; Plans for
         expansion of parking in the area; Would like to talk to ST about a potential shared
         garage; Their parking study showed that Sounder riders park along Sector Ave between
         5th and 7th Streets

         Need a garage

         4th Ave is used as overflow parking

         Sounder riders park along tracks east of 3rd St NE all the way down to Dominos Pizza
         (along Spring Street?)

         If Puyallup riders will continue to have access to Cornforth offsite parking, it would be
         really great if the asphalt could be repaired and relined. I would be willing to park at the
         Red Gate lot, but with the addition of catching a bus, that increase my already lengthy
         commute by another half an hour. I have also heard complaints that the buses from the
         Red Lot are arriving too close to the departure of the trains now which makes it difficult
         for anyone who needs to purchase a ticket.

         I was on the steering committee for Puyallup when John Hubbard headed things up.The
         Promise he made was that downtown parking would not be affected ."If in the unlikely
         event that the parking lot becomes full then we will build a parking structure here"
         [pointing to the plans] Since then i have spoken to numerous representatives and to the
         City Counciland about all i ever here is "we must do a study'. Well 5 studies and surveys
         later the merchants downtown are still suffering. The commuters are mostly from out of
         town and don't really shop. I hope that between you and the Council you can find a win
         win situation for all.

         More train cars, more train runs

         Coordinate bus service with train

         Coordinate buses with Sounder trains departures and arrivals

         Have more trains and mid-day- BNSF conflict or have an express bus mimic train route
         when train can't run

         Reschedule trains with 1 earlier, and 2 later

         Still want us to get to all day Sounder service and weekend service

         More local bus service to train station. More Sounder service on nights and weekends.
         More local connector service from Puyallup to P&R-South Hill.

         More train cars, more train runs

         Mid day train.

         trying to figure out the schedules and cost was difficult

         The people most affected by this WILL NOT BE AT THE MEETINGS AS THEY WILL STILL BE
         ON THE BLOODY TRAINS AT 4PM???? Couldn't Sound Transit bother to do it from 7 -9PM
         at selected locations or would that cramp their style? Government genius at its finest

         Puyallup express takes 1.5 hours from Seattle to Puyallup

         Dedicated connector bus in between Tukwila Station- TIB- Sea-Tac Airport during
         Sounder and Amtrak train times.

         Add food services also inside the train. Make it be almost like Amtrak.

         Seating on train getting tight. Overhead racks are too narrow so you cannot put your
         bags up there. Most people put bags on the other seat-takes up space [that could be
         used] for another person.

         Better Wi-Fi

Access

         Bridge/overpass from Stewart to station, crosswalk

         Bike lanes on 5th street SW

         Bridge over tracks for accessing train in the morning.

         No crosswalks are concerns for pedestrians crossing streets.

         We desperately need a crosswalk from the Sounder parking lot which crosses 5th St. SW
         to the corner of the block across from the Eagles building. Someone is going to be hit
         crossing at night. We also need a walkway from the other side for when we disembark
         on the opposite side of the tracks.

         Crosswalks by Eagles. Bridge/overpass for other side of tracks.

         SW corner of the 5th St. RR x-ing. Walkway tunnel UNDER tracks to connect E& W sides.

         Better shuttle service from the Red Lot and South Hill park and ride, Make it a
         continuous loop shuttle, Bridge or tunnel that goes above/below tracks at the station

         Provide concrete shuttle information for "Red Lot" ­ how long before the next train
         arrives, does the shuttle leave.

         For use of Red Lot, local bus connections, bike lockers area and lockers.

         People don't use crosswalks and cut across Main Ave

         Need a crosswalk across 5th St NW at Sector Ave

         Need an overpass over the tracks because it is far to walk around to the other platform

         Need a crosswalk across W. Stewart at 2nd Street NW (or signal?)

         Pedestrian crossing across 5th Street SW to get from the main Sounder parking lot to
         the auxiliary lot is unmarked; a great improvement could be a cross walk on 5th Street
         SW just north of 3rd Ave NW.

         I ride my bike the station so I really appreciate the bike lockers on the platform. Thanks
         for those. If there are plans to build a multi-level parking lot at the Puyallup station, it
         would be important to me that easy access to bike lockers be preserved.

         I am wondering if there are plans for a pedestrian bridge or tunnel that could be used to
         cross the tracks. At the moment, crossing the tracks always requires a trek to one end of
         the platform or the other and then the crossing gates may be down. A means to cross
         the tracks in the middle of the platform would be very helpful. A bridge like the one in
         Kent would be nice, but an underpass/tunnel under the tracks would be even more
         convenient.

Station

         Coffee stand, Bathrooms, Indoor heated area, More Orca card readers

         Real-time next-bus info (more reliable service), to improve security-install cameras and
         enforce violations.

         coffee bar/indoor heated area, bathrooms, more readers at platform side

         It also would be nice to have another orca card station in Puyallup on the East end of
         the platform on both sides of tracks, on East end. Currently people in last car have to
         double back to tap card before going to offsite parking. So an additional tap station in
         East end of platform would be great. Beautiful.

         Train station is less than 50% Sounder users the rest are post office, police, fire, school
         district employees and students. Lots have skateboarders, drug use, and unattended
         areas.

         It is impossible to know on which side of the two tracks to bard going to Seattle. There
         was a wealth of information on the bus schedules, which does nothing for the Sounder
         riders. There is a very small sign down low on one of the track sides, that gives some
         limited information.

         I would like to (again and again and again) request tagging machines on both sides at
         the far north end of the station. As at least half of the Puyallup riders pass the north end
         of the station every day, it would seem to make sense to have the machines handy
         instead of expecting riders to go out of their way to tag especially when the train
         disembarks riders on the right side (wrong side) in the evening.

         The ideal solution would be to close the Puyallup and Sumner station and build a new
         super-station near Shaw Road, half way between Puyallup and Sumner.

         We could like to see a Sounder Transit go from South Hill, Puyallup to McChord AFB or
         Fort Lewis. We live in a HUGE community of Military and traffic is horrible going down
         176th to get to the bases. We would like to see an easier way to get to work w/o stress
         of traffic.

         That is at least worth of discussion is the idea of a station between Sumner and Puyallup
Sounder Stations Flexible Access Study ­ Appendix C                                                    30

         A great idea in the wrong place, more between Sumner and Puyallup.

         I have ridden the train from Puyallup for 7 years. I live in downtown and would like the
         station moved to in between Sumner and Puyallup to provide better parking, quick
         access to freeways, space for parking without ugly and expensive garages, enough space
         for covered queues; the large majority of riders drive or speed through Puyallup to get
         home to South Hill, Orting, Parkland, Spanaway. They can all get home quicker with
         close freeway access. Envision the East Pierce county Regional Transit Center, 2 minutes
         to 410, 167, 512, serving train riders from Sumner, Puyallup, Bonney Lake, Buckley,
         Orting, Graham, Spanaway and conveniently located at Shaw and Pioneer.

         Give up on downtown sites in Sumner and Puyallup and build large transit center at
         Shaw road. Make the cities "buy their mistakes" from ST. Cities were the ones who
         wanted stations downtown and learned they were wrong.

Communication

         Would like to see more communication of the vision of development. Mixed use
         development is favorable. Some concerns of pedestrian crossings on Stewart; lighting
         and crossing.

         I believe you would benefit from improved interface with commuters and residents

         Provide advanced warning when train is going to locate on other tracks

Ticketing

         Round trip Puyallup-Seattle used to be a day pass. It is still advertised that way at the
         ticket vending machine but not accepted in Seattle buses. It should be an option to buy
         a "real" day pass ticket.

         Buy tickets on the train

Miscellaneous

         Publicity at Farmers market, Fair, etc

         Concerns for neighbors are contamination on lot, security during and after hours, pets
         dying due to commuters. Garbage in yards, lawns and yards being cut through. Would
         like to see no one air blowing lot at 2AM. Driveways blocked off daily at our houses.

         Encourage better overhead coverage on walk routes- businesses on Meridian (awnings)
         for rain protection.

         At last week's "Sounder Parking Open House" held at city hall, council member John
         Knutsen stated than he had conducted a study to evaluate the residential locations of
         those who parked at the leased Sounder parking lot (Cornforth-Campbell) in downtown
         Puyallup. He elaborated that he had the Puyallup Police Department run a check on
         every car parked there. This check went as far as identifying which cars were registered
         to owners residing inside and outside Puyallup city limits. At a minimum, I find this to be
         a misuse of valuable police time. Also, what other checks are the police running on the
         owners, open warrants, unpaid traffic tickets etc that commuters are not aware of ? The
         question is, who authorized this action at city hall or was it a rogue activity at the behest
         of one of two council members with personal financial interest? Either way, to conduct
         this kind of covert operation against an assumed level of privacy of Sounder Train
         commuters expect is simply disgusting.

Access

Tacoma Dome and South Tacoma Stations:

         Simple solutions such as crosswalks surrounding this on Puyallup, bike-ped way finding
         and bike connections to regional facilities such as the water ditch trail South Tacoma

         Crosswalks at all surrounding intersections within ½ mile would help. Connect bike trails,
         existing and planned-see the Mobility Master Plan for how these needs could help each
         other out.

         Provide way finding signage near station that describes distance to local amenities or
         destinations by minutes and miles (e.g. car museum, waterfront, Downtown Tacoma,
         etc.)

         Supportive of providing better access for pedestrians and bike riders to the Sounder
         station; better and more bike paths, bike racks or lockers, wider sidewalks, etc.

         Providing residential around stations allows people to walk to transit to commute to
         Seattle and other towns along the way

         Sound Transit should help Tacoma implement their Mobility Plan, extending bike routes,
         etc. and encouraging them to keep them clean of gravel and litter.

Tacoma Dome Station:

         Bicycle connection for E. 23rd to existing N/S Tacoma Dome station bike lane

         Tacoma Dome Station: Bike lanes on D St. should extend beyond I-5 bridge south, up
         McKinley to S. 38th. Likewise, bike lanes on L Street over I-5 to S. 38th. This gives riders
         smooth access from downtown via Hood Street overpass of Foss Waterway.

         Pedestrian safe connections (crosswalk, lighting, etc) for Puyallup Ave, East D & Puyallup
         Ave at Tacoma Dome station.

         For bikes, try to connect "existing" trail along Dock to Stadium with Schuster Parkway
         "existing" trail. The current crossing on the sidewalk is rather awkward.

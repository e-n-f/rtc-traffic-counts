Transportation Impact Analysis
4609 Union Bay Place NE                                                                March 2016



                                      Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts of
the development of a residential building with ground floor commercial use located at 4609
Union Bay Place NE.


Project Description
The proposed project is located northwest of the Union Bay Place NE/ NE 45th Place/
NE 45th Street intersection and east of University Village as shown on Figure 1. The
proposed development includes 217 microhousing efficiency units, 22 one bedroom
apartments, 5 two bedroom apartments, and approximately 21,000 square feet of commercial
space. The site is currently occupied by a 3,300 square foot office building that would be
removed with this development.

Site access to a 68 stall parking garage would be provided via one driveway accessed from
Union Bay Place NE about 700 feet northwest of the NE 45th Street/ Union Bay Place
NE intersection. The parking garage would be managed by two gates, one at the main
entrance would be open to all site visitors during mid-day periods and a second within the
garage that serves only apartment residents. The resident-only portion of the garage would
provide 43 stalls while the area open to either residents or commercial visitors provides
25 stalls. The project is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by 2018. A preliminary
first floor site plan is shown on Figure 2.


Study Scope
Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed project and coordination with City
of Seattle Department of Planning and Development (DPD) staff, the following intersections
were selected for analysis:

    1. Union Bay Place NE/ NE 45th Place-NE 45th Street
    2. Montlake Boulevard NE/ NE 45th Street
    3. Montlake Boulevard NE/ NE Pacific Place
    4. Montlake Boulevard NE/ NE Pacific Street
    5. 15th Avenue NE/ NE 45th Street
    6. Brooklyn Avenue NE/ NE 45th Street
    7. Roosevelt Avenue NE/ NE 45th Street

Additionally, the site access located along Union Bay Place NE was evaluated consistent with
City of Seattle requirements. This study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour when
transportation impacts are anticipated to be greatest. The report first describes existing and
future (2018) without-project conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the
street system, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2018)
with-project conditions are then described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding
transportation system are identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the
future without-project conditions.

         Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes the existing (2015) and future (2018) without-project conditions within
the study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street system and planned
improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service.

Street System
The following sections describe the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed
project and anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.

Existing
Characteristics of the existing street system in the proposed project vicinity are summarized
in Table 1. As shown, the site is in the immediate vicinity of multiple arterials.

The construction of Sound Transit’s Link Light Rail Northgate Extension includes two stations
located within the study area that are currently under construction: The University of
Washington Station located near Husky Stadium and the University District (U-District)
Station located near the NE 45th Street/ Brooklyn Avenue NE intersection. Related roadway
and intersection improvements near The University of Washington Station are currently
complete and no further changes to roadway or intersection capacity are planned.

The U-District Station is currently scheduled to be completed in 2021 and construction has
altered the existing roadway network in the vicinity. The intersection of NE 45th Street/
Brooklyn Avenue NE currently operates as a T-intersection with the south leg closed due to
this construction. The intersection is anticipated to resume operation as a four-leg
intersection roughly 6 months prior to the opening of the U-District Station.1 Because the
2018 buildout date of the proposed project precedes the 2021 buildout date of the light rail
extension and the re-conversion of NE 45th Street/ Brooklyn Avenue NE to a four-leg
intersection, the existing conditions were assumed to be in place for both future without-
project and future-with project conditions.

Future
The City of Seattle 2015 – 2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and Sound
Transit’s Updated 2014 Long Range Plan were reviewed to identify planned improvements
that would impact intersection or roadway capacity in the project vicinity.

Based on a review of both documents, no transportation improvements were identified that
would impact the street system capacity and travel patterns in the study area other than the
aforementioned Sound Transit U-District construction currently underway.


Traffic Volumes
The following summarize the traffic volumes for existing and future without-project conditions.

Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection in October 2015. Figure 3 illustrates
the existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections, rounded to the
nearest 5 vehicles. Detailed traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.

It should be noted that the northbound left turn at the intersection of NE 45th Street/ 15th
Avenue NE is restricted to only busses during the PM peak hour. A sign illuminates which
advises drivers that the northbound left turn is not an allowed movement.

As previously described, the south leg of NE 45th Street/ Brooklyn Avenue NE is closed due
to construction of the U-District Light Rail Station. Existing traffic counts showed less than 5
traveling to and from the south leg and were likely construction vehicles. These vehicles were
excluded from analysis.

Future
Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of 1.5 percent per year was applied to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes
at each study intersection and was confirmed with Seattle DPD staff. Traffic from the
following pipeline projects in the project vicinity were also included in the future without-
project volume forecasts:
        4516 Union Bay Place NE (DPD #3019495)
        4000 NE 41st Street (DPD # 3015404)
        2746 NE 45th Street (DPD #3008972)

Future (2018) without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects are shown on Figure 4.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour
of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection. Traffic
operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service
(LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme
congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS
criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM Peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010) except for the intersections at Union Bay Place NE/ NE 45th
Street and Montlake Boulevard NE/ NE Pacific Street which were based on HCM 2000
methodology. This was done because HCM 2010 methodologies cannot analyze 5 leg
intersections. All intersections were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating intersection
operations.

Note that the protected westbound left turn phase at Union Bay Place NE/ NE 45th
Place/ NE 45th Street is currently disabled. Because of this, the westbound left turn
movement currently operates as a permitted left turn in conjunction with the westbound
through movement.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2018) without-project weekday PM peak hour conditions are summarized in Table
2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection are included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, all existing signalized and unsignalized intersections currently operate
at LOS D or better during the weekday PM peak hour. With the anticipated growth in traffic by
2018, the LOS is anticipated to degrade at three intersections, Montlake Boulevard NE/
NE Pacific Street, 15th Avenue NE/ NE 45th Street, and Roosevelt Avenue NE/ NE 45th
Street, but would operate at LOS E or better.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify any existing traffic
safety issues. The most recent three year summary of accident data from the Seattle
Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2012 and
December 31, 2014 and is summarized in Table 3 and Table 4 for intersections and roadway
segments, respectively.

SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The most
recent review was completed in 2015 and screens locations for the previous year (in this
case 2014). Locations are identified as a HCL at signalized intersections with 10 or more
collisions in a year, mid-block locations with 10 or more collisions a year, and locations with 5
or more pedestrian or bike collisions. As shown in Table 3, all intersections were below these
criteria.

Seattle’s adopted criteria for determining high accident locations at mid-block locations is 10
or more collisions per year. As shown in Table 4, most roadways fall below the City’s criteria.
The mid-block location on Montlake Boulevard NE between NE Pacific Place and 25th
Avenue NE is included on Seattle’s Draft 2014 Candidate Locations report for 2013 calendar
collisions, having had 12 collisions in 2013. This mid-block location experienced a slight
decrease in 2014, but still experienced more than 10 collisions, resulting in a three-year
average of 10.67 collisions per year and could be selected as a HCL in the 2015 report
(anticipated in 2016). It should be noted that of the 32 recorded collisions over the past three
years, 22 would be classified as either angle, rear end, or side swipe. Additionally, this
particular roadway segment experiences congestion during the PM peak period. Considering
the collision types and congestion issues on the roadway, many of the collisions are likely
congestion related.

In addition to a review of the motor vehicle collisions, pedestrian and bicycle collisions within
the study area were also reviewed. Two intersections reported elevated pedestrian or pedal
cyclist collisions: NE 45th Street/ Brooklyn Avenue NE, which reported 6 pedestrian
collisions, and NE 45th Street/ Roosevelt Way NE, which reported 4 pedestrian collisions
over the specified three-year time period. Currently, NE 45th Street/ Roosevelt Way NE is
listed as a HCL under pedestrian locations, but because the intersection did not experience a
pedestrian collision in 2014, the three-year average of four collisions would fall below the
city’s HCL standard of 5 collisions per three years. The NE 45th Street/ Brooklyn Avenue NE
is not currently classified as a HCL, but would likely be added to the HCL list in the 2015

report due to the increase in pedestrian-related collisions in 2014. It should be noted that 4 of
the 6 collisions occurred in either dark or wet weather conditions.


Non-Motorized Facilities
The following describes the existing and future non-motorized facilities within the study area.

Existing
Sidewalks are provided on all streets in the study area except for Union Bay Place NE. Non-
motorized facilities along this roadway alternate between sidewalks and separated, striped
shoulders. Marked crosswalks exist on all sides of the intersections along NE 45th Street
except for NE 45th Street and Montlake Boulevard NE which lack marked crosswalks along
the east and west legs since no pedestrian facilities are provided on the northern corner of
the intersection. The intersections of Montlake Boulevard NE/ NE Pacific Place and Montlake
Boulevard NE and NE Pacific Street lack marked crosswalks along the south and north legs,
respectively.

Bicycle sharrows are provided on NE 45th Street between Roosevelt Way NE and 15th
Avenue NE. While no dedicated bicycle facilities are provided on NE 45th Street east of 20th
Avenue NE or along Montlake Boulevard NE, both corridors and the project site are in close
proximity to the Burke-Gilman Trail which serves a large volume of both pedestrian and
bicycle travel. The Burke-Gilman Trail connects the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle with the
University District, Ravenna, and extends northeast towards Bothell.

Recent improvements to the Burke-Gilman through the University District were completed in
June 2015. These improvements included widening of the trail and enhanced separation from
vehicle traffic to promote safety.

Future
According to the City of Seattle 2015 – 2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
and Seattle Bicycle Master Plan (SBMP) 2015-2019, there are no planned non-motorized
improvement projects within the immediate site vicinity. However, the SMBP denotes planned
improvements to the bicycle crossing of the Montlake Bridge.


Transit Service
The following sections describe existing and future transit service within the study area.

Existing
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit. The nearest
transit stops to the site are two bus stops located at the NE 45th Street/ Union Bay
Place NE intersection. Busses traveling westbound use the stop on the west leg while busses
traveling eastbound use the stop on the east leg. Table 5 summarizes the bus routes that
operate within 0.25 miles of the project site and stop at this intersection.

Future
Two transit improvements are planned within the study area that are part of Sound Transit’s
Northgate Link Extension of light rail service. These include the University of Washington
Station and the U-District Station.

The University of Washington Station will be an underground Sound Transit University Link
light rail station near the Husky Stadium in Seattle and is scheduled to open along with the
rest of the University Link project in 2016. The entrance to the underground station will be
located adjacent to Husky Stadium and east of Montlake Boulevard between NE Pacific
Street and NE Pacific Place. The entrance will have a pedestrian bridge between the station
and the Rainier Vista on the UW campus. Passengers will be able to access the pedestrian
bridge from just north of the Burke-Gilman Trail in the Rainier Vista and from the Triangle
Plaza.

The U-District Station will be an underground Sound Transit University Link light rail station
located along Brooklyn Avenue NE between NE 43rd Street and NE 45th Street and is
scheduled to open along with the Northgate and Roosevelt Stations in 2021. There will be
two entrances to the underground station located along Brooklyn Avenue NE. The site is
designed to accommodate future development above the station.

                                   Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
street system and at study intersections. First, estimated traffic generated by the proposed
project was distributed and assigned to adjacent roadways and intersections within the study
area for the weekday PM peak hour. Next, project trips were added to future without-project
traffic volumes and potential impacts to traffic operations were forecast. An evaluation of
traffic safety, non-motorized impact, site access analysis, parking analysis, and transportation
concurrency were also conducted.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project is estimated by comparing the
anticipated trip generation of the proposed uses on site to those currently generated by the
site. Project trip generation was estimated based on a widely accepted urban development
practice of calculating person trips and then estimating the proportion of the person trips that
would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates
are for suburban locations and may over-predict the number of vehicle trips in an urban
environment which typically has a larger portion of trips served by alternative modes such as
walking, biking, and transit given the mix of development and level of transit service.
Therefore, the trip generation considers the use of alternative modes of travel. The number of
overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person trips for weekday daily,
and AM and PM peak hours and then separating the person trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto,
transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates the trip generation process.




                                                                                              13

Total person trips were developed for the proposed and existing uses based on trip rates
from the ITE’s Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition). Initial average vehicle occupancy (AVO)
was estimated using the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report
365 Travel Estimating Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed and existing land
uses. Person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the total
person trips by the estimated mode splits, which differed for each land use.

Residential person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the
total person trips from by the estimated mode splits from the US Census 2009-2013
American Community Survey 5-year Estimates Commuting Characteristics. The survey
shows a 43 percent auto mode split for Census Tract 43.01 where the project is located. After
applying the auto mode split, residential person trips were then converted back to vehicle
trips by assuming an AVO of 1.03 also estimated from census data for the project vicinity.

It was assumed that 60 percent of retail trips would be vehicular trips after considering
proximity to transit and non-motorized facilities in the area. Retail person trips using each
transportation mode were determined by multiplying total person trips by the assumed mode
split. Retail person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by applying a localized
AVO of 1.48, assumed to be equal to that of the initial AVO based on NCHRP.

The mode split for the existing office land use was estimated from the Commute Seattle’s
2014 Center City Commuter Mode Split for non-CTR affected commuter trips and offices with
1-19 employees. The data shows that for the overall Seattle area, 50 percent of employee
trips were made by vehicle, 35 percent by transit, and 15 percent by walking, biking, or other
modes. Though the Commute Seattle data specifically applies to the Center City area, this
mode split assumption results in a conservative estimate of the project’s net new vehicular
trip generation. By potentially assuming a smaller portion of vehicle trips and a larger portion
of transit and non-motorized trips for the existing office use, less vehicle trips are deducted
from the project’s overall vehicular trip generation. After applying the auto mode split, office
person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by assuming a localized AVO of 1.11,
equal to that of the initial AVO based on NCHRP.

Appendix D provides the detailed trip generation calculation. Table 6 summarizes the
estimated weekday daily, AM, and PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed and
existing land uses. Values presented in Table 6 represent the total trip generation.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.
2. Retail pass-by trips estimated using information provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineer’s Trip Generation Handbook
    (3rd Edition).


As shown in Table 6, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 1,090
new daily vehicle trips with 60 new vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 99 new vehicle


                                                                                                                                  14

4609 Union Bay Place NE                                                                         March 2016


trips during the PM peak hour. With the retail component a total of 16 pass-by trips are
anticipated during the PM peak hour and 4 during the weekday AM peak hour.

Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based primarily on
guidance from the U.S. Census Bureau’s OnTheMap tool and coordination from City of
Seattle Department of Planning and Development (DPD) staff. OnTheMap is a web-based
mapping and reporting application which shows where workers are employed and where they
live. The OnTheMap data was translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-
mile radius of the proposed project and where they work. The zip codes where people work
were evaluated to determine if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via
vehicle or by other means. Trips to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more
transit oriented locations are more likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes.
Zip codes outside the Seattle City limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive.

Figure 5 illustrates the expected project vehicle trip distribution for the proposed project, to
the surrounding local and regional street system. The net new weekday PM peak hour trips
were assigned to the study area based on the travel patterns shown on Figure 5 and the
location of the site access.


Traffic Volume Impact
Project traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes to
form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2018 with-project traffic volumes are
shown on Figure 6.

Table 7 summarizes the project traffic volume impact at the study intersections during the
weekday PM peak hour for the project site.

As shown in the table, the percent traffic volume impacts are generally less than 3 percent at
the study intersections. Overall the project volume impacts identified at the study
intersections are within the range of daily fluctuations in traffic, which can be as much as 5 to
10 percent.

Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was evaluated for the weekday PM peak hour to analyze
traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as described for
existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters such as
channelization, traffic control, and signal timing were kept consistent with those used in the
evaluation of future without-project conditions.

A comparison of future without and with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic operations is
summarized for the project site in Table 8. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in
Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 8, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
with no change in calculated LOS at any of the study intersections. Note that the addition of
project traffic at four of the study intersections results in a small decrease to the overall
intersections’ average delay due to being assigned to low delay movements.


Site Access Evaluation
As described previously, the proposed project includes one underground parking garage
designated for both the residential and retail uses. Garage access will be provided through a
driveway via Union Bay Place NE. Forecast (2018) traffic volumes shown in Figure 6 and are
based on total gross trips generated by the project. The site driveway is anticipated to
operate at LOS B with an average delay of about 11.5 seconds during the weekday PM Peak
hour.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. As
shown in Table 9, the screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include
Screenlines 5.16, 6.15, and 13.13. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all
project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of the screenlines would extend across the
screenlines.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
project the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus,
the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply and estimated peak parking
demand of the project.


On-Site Parking Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by an underground parking garage with a
total of 68 stalls. Of these, 43 stalls will be restricted to resident use only and the remaining
25 would be available to either residents or retail visitors. Access to the parking garage would
be via a driveway along Union Bay Place NE and is shown in Figure 2 (page 3). Additionally,
120 long-term resident and 10 retail bicycle parking stalls would be provided with the
proposed project.

Parking Demand
Parking demand for the 217 microhousing efficiency units and 27 one and two-bedroom
apartment units was estimated using data from a micro-housing parking survey collected in
2012 and 2015 at existing micro-housing apartments in the Central District and University
District. The surveys showed that residents of a typical micro-housing unit that provides on-
site parking owned an average of 0.34 vehicles per unit in Seattle. Detailed survey
information is provided Appendix F.

Parking demand for the retail land use was estimated based on data provided in ITE Parking
Generation (4th Edition) and mode splits consistent with those used for the trip generation
estimate. The residential (apartment and microhousing) peak parking demand is expected to
occur overnight while the retail peak parking demand is expected to occur mid-day. Table 10
summarizes the estimated peak parking demand for this individual uses. Note that peak
parking demands for residential and retail uses peak at different times of the day.




                                                                                                                     19

Retail (21.0 ksf)                                        1.53                      33 vehicles mid-day

Note: du = dwelling units, ksf = 1,000 square feet


As shown in the table above, the maximum on-site peak parking demand for the proposed
project would be 97 vehicles during the overnight peak period. The peak parking demand for
the retail use is expected to be 33 vehicles and would occur mid-day.

As previously described, peak parking demands for the individual uses would occur at
different times of the day; residential uses typically peak in the overnight hours while retail
uses typically peak midday. Parking Generation provides additional information regarding
how parking demands for each of these uses vary during a typical weekday. The shared
parking demand over the course of a typical weekday based on this information is shown in
the following chart.

The proposed supply of 68 parking spaces would not accommodate the estimated peak on-
site peak parking demand and could result in an anticipated overspill of 29 vehicles overnight.

Unrestricted on-street parking exists on Union Bay Place NE north of the project site and one
Diamond parking lot is provided within one-quarter mile of the proposed project. This parking
lot is not directly associated with University Village and contains 42 stalls. During mid-day
conditions, 10 vehicle parking spaces were observed to be unoccupied along Union Bay
Place NE and only 11 vehicles were observed parked in the parking lot. Only 3 vehicles were
observed parked along Union Bay Place NE overnight and is reflective of the existing
commercial uses along the roadway. Considering the available on-street supply and the
nearby Diamond Parking lot, the overspill from the garage is likely to be accommodated off-
site in the project vicinity.




                                                                                                           20

Traffic Safety Impacts
As previously described, all study intersections and mid-block roadway locations fall below
the City of Seattle’s high accident location criteria with the exception of one mid-block
location. Montlake Boulevard NE between NE Pacific Place and 25th Avenue NE is likely to
remain on the City of Seattle’s list of HCLs for the City’s 2016 review. Traffic generated by the
proposed development would likely result in a proportionate increase in the probability of
traffic accidents; however, based on the minimal increase in overall traffic volumes and the
impacts to intersection operations it is unlikely that this increased probability would create a
new safety hazard or significantly increase the number of reported accidents.

Additionally, two intersections along NE 45th Street (at Brooklyn Avenue NE and Roosevelt
Avenue NE) could remain on the list of HCLs for pedestrian collisions. Because most of the
collisions resulted from right or left turning movements, the increase in through traffic along
NE 45th Street associated with the proposed project is not anticipated to directly create a
safety hazard or significantly increase the number of reported accidents.


Non-Motorized Impact
An estimated 23 percent of residential trips and 25 percent of retail trips are forecast to be
either pedestrian of bicycle trips. This results in a forecast of approximately 730 weekday
non-motorized trips with 39 during the AM peak hour and 67 during the PM peak hour and
would increase the use of pedestrian facilities within the project vicinity. Detailed non-
motorized trip generation calculations are provided in Appendix D.

Frontage improvements to be built as part of the proposed project would include the
construction of a sidewalk. This sidewalk would connect to the existing pedestrian walkway
along the west side of Union Bay Place NE and further improves pedestrian facilities along
this roadway. The non-motorized facilities like the Burke-Gilman Trail and the project’s
frontage improvements in close proximity would serve the increased non-motorized traffic
generated by the proposed project.


Transit Impacts
An estimated 34 percent of residential trips and 15 percent of retail trips would be transit trips.
This results in a forecast of approximately 790 weekday transit trips with 50 during the AM
peak hour and 72 during the PM peak hour and would increase the demand for transit
services within the project vicinity. Detailed trip generation calculations are provided in
Appendix D. Increased transit usage is generally considered a positive impact to the transit
system by the City of Seattle.

                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the development located at
4609 Union Bay Place NE in the University Village neighborhood of Seattle. General findings
and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would construct 217 microhousing efficiency units along with
           27 one and two-bedroom apartments. In addition to the residential component,
           approximately 21,000 square feet of retail. Access to the proposed parking garage
           would be provided via a driveway off of Union Bay Place NE.
          The development is anticipated to generate 1,090 net new vehicular weekday daily
           trips with 60 net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 99 net
           new trips during the PM peak hour. With the retail component, a total of 16 pass-by
           trips are anticipated during the PM peak hour and 4 during the AM peak hour.
          All of the off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS D or better
           with the project.
          The site access driveway is anticipated to operate at LOS B with minimal delay.
          Project estimated peak parking demand is anticipated to be approximately 97
           vehicles due primarily to the residential land use and occur overnight. This could
           result in an overspill of 29 vehicles. Peak parking demand for the retail land use is
           expected to be 33 vehicles and occur mid-day. The overnight overspill would be
           accommodated by the available off-site parking supply.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The proposed project would include the construction of a sidewalk along the west
           side of Union Bay Place NE that would connect to the existing pedestrian walkway.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.

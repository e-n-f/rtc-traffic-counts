                                Traffic Impact Analysis

  A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be submitted to the city with a land use application under
  any one or more of the following circumstances:
       To determine whether a significant affect on the transportation system would result from
          a proposed amendment to the Newport Comprehensive Plan or to a land use regulation,
          as specified in OAR 660-012-0060.
       ODOT requires a TIA in conjunction with a requested approach road permit, as specified
          in OAR 734-051-3030(4). (ODOT District 4 development review phone number is 541-
          757-4211.)
       The proposal may generate 100 PM peak-hour trips or more onto city streets or county
          roads.
       The proposal may increase use of any adjacent street by 10 vehicles or more per day that
          exceeds 26,000 pound gross vehicle weight.
       The proposal includes a request to use Trip Reserve Fund trips to meet the
          requirements of Chapter 14.43, South Beach Transportation Overlay Zone.

  Pre-Application Conference:
             The applicant shall contact the City Community Development Department to request that
             a meeting be scheduled with the City Engineer prior to submitting an application that
             requires a TIA. This meeting will be coordinated with ODOT when an approach road to
             US-101 or US-20 serves the property so that the completed TIA meets both City and
             ODOT requirements.

  Study Area:
  The following facilities shall be included in the study area for all TIAs:
      All site-access points and intersections (signalized and unsignalized) adjacent to the
          proposed site. If the proposed site fronts an arterial or collector street, the analysis shall
          address all intersections and driveways along the site frontage and within the access
          spacing distances extending out from the boundary of the site frontage.
      Roads through and adjacent to the site.
      All intersections needed for signal progression analysis.
      In addition to these requirements, the City Engineer may require analysis of any
          additional intersections or roadway links that may be adversely affected as a result of the
          proposed development.

  TIA Requirements:
             The submitted TIA shall be prepared by an Oregon Registered Professional Engineer that
             is qualified to perform traffic engineering analysis and will be paid for by the applicant.
             The latest edition of the Trip Generation Manual (published by the Institute of
             Transportation Engineers (ITE)) shall be used to gauge PM peak hour vehicle trips unless
             a specific trip generation study that is approved by the City Engineer indicates an
             alternative trip generation rate is appropriate. An applicant may choose, but is not
             required, to use a trip generation study as a reference to determine trip generation for a

             specific land use which is not well-represented in the ITE Trip Generation Manual and
             for which similar facilities are available to count.
             Intersection-level analysis shall occur at every intersection where 50 or more peak hour
             vehicle trips can be expected as a result of the proposal.
             The TIA shall comply with the requirements of OAR 660-012-0060.
             The TIA shall address the condition of the impacted roadways and identify structural
             deficiencies or reduction in the useful life of existing facilities related to the proposed
             development.
             If the proposal includes an increase in 10 or more vehicles per day that exceed 26,000
             pounds GVW, the TIA shall address the structural conditions above for the routes used to
             reach US-101 or US-20.

  Approval Process:
  When a TIA is required, the applicable review process will be the same as that accorded to the
  underlying land use proposal. If a land use action is not otherwise required, then approval of the
  proposed development shall follow a Type II decision making process.

  Approval Criteria:
  When a TIA is required, a development proposal is subject to the following criteria, in addition to
  all criteria otherwise applicable to the underlying proposal:
        The analysis complies with the TIA requirements;
        The TIA demonstrates that adequate transportation facilities exist to serve the proposed
            development or identifies mitigation measures that resolve the traffic safety problems in a
            manner that is satisfactory to the City Engineer and, when state highway facilities are
            affected, to ODOT; and
        Where a proposed amendment to the Newport Comprehensive Plan or land use regulation
            would significantly affect an existing or planned transportation facility, the TIA must
            demonstrate that solutions have been developed that are consistent with the provisions of
            OAR 660-012-0060; and
        For affected non-highway facilities, the TIA establishes that any Level of Service
            standards adopted by the City have been met, and development will not cause excessive
            queuing or delays at affected intersections, as determined in the City Engineer's sole
            discretion; and
        Proposed public improvements are designed and will be constructed to the standards
            specified in Chapter 14.44 Transportation Standards or Chapter 13.05, Subdivision and
            Partition, as applicable.

  Application Fee:
  No fee is required for the review of a TIA report that is submitted in conjunction with another
  required land use action. The application fee for City review of a TIA report that is independent
  of another land use action is $487.

Matt,

Sorry for the delay. Derrick wanted me to wait to reply until you had spoken with him.

This is substantially what we discussed on the phone. Couple of comments:

The fishing season has a significant impact on the truck traffic in the Bayfront area. I have included the season below
and I think they should be taken into consideration for the study.

    ·     Shrimp April 1 ­ October 31
    ·     Hake June 15      Quota, this year the season ended in late November
    ·     Crab December 1 this is good for a couple of month then drops off after that

Also, we have some traffic counts from the area if you are interested.

As part of the analysis, we need to know the impact to the areas in the study and then possible recommendations on
ways to mitigate the impacts, if any. For example, turn lanes, lengthening an existing turn lane etc.

Thanks.

Tim,

Thank you for taking the time to talk with me over the phone regarding the proposed Teevin Bros. operation. I wanted
to follow up with this e-mail to make sure I captured all of your comments. Here is a summary of what was discussed:
    · Traffic study would be needed to address Item D of the Newport Traffic Impact Analysis requirements.
    · Critical study intersections include:
            o Highway 20/Southeast Moore Drive
            o Bay Boulevard/Southeast Moore Drive
            o Two site access driveways off of Bay Road
    · Critical time periods include:
            o Weekday a.m. (7:00-9:00 a.m.) and weekday p.m. (4:00-6:00 p.m.) peak periods
    · Items to address in addition to the intersection impacts noted above:
            o Develop a customized trip generation profile of the operation recognizing there are no ITE Trip
                Generation land uses that would be applicable for the proposed operation.
            o Analyze the anticipated truck routing and quantify usage of these routes. Analyze structural impacts per
                TIA guidelines.

Please let me know if there is anything that I overlooked for misinterpreted. Thanks.

December 26, 2012                                                                                                                              Page: B-2



ATTACHMENT B LEVEL-OF-SERVICE CONCEPT
Level of service (LOS) is a concept developed to quantify the degree of comfort (including such
elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of stopped delay, and impediments caused by
other vehicles) afforded to drivers as they travel through an intersection or roadway segment. Six
grades are used to denote the various level of service from "A" to "F".1


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
The six level-of-service grades are described qualitatively for signalized intersections in Table B1.
Additionally, Table B2 identifies the relationship between level of service and average control delay per
vehicle. Control delay is defined to include initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Using this definition, Level of Service "D" is generally considered to
represent the minimum acceptable design standard.


Table B-1               Level-of-Service Definitions (Signalized Intersections)

   Level of
   Service                                                           Average Delay per Vehicle
                 Very low average control delay, less than 10 seconds per vehicle. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and most
       A         vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
                 Average control delay is greater than 10 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 20 seconds per vehicle. This generally
                 occurs with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for a level of service A, causing higher levels of
       B         average delay.
                 Average control delay is greater than 20 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher
                 delays may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
       C         The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
                 Average control delay is greater than 35 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of
                 congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
                 length, or high volume/capacity ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle
       D         failures are noticeable.
                 Average control delay is greater than 55 seconds per vehicle and less than or equal to 80 seconds per vehicle. This is usually
                 considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally (but not always) indicate poor progression, long
       E         cycle lengths, and high volume/capacity ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
                 Average control delay is in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to most drivers. This condition
                 often occurs with oversaturation. It may also occur at high volume/capacity ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle failures.
       F         Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute to such high delay values.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
Unsignalized intersections include two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC)
intersections. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides models for estimating control delay
at both TWSC and AWSC intersections. A qualitative description of the various service levels associated
with an unsignalized intersection is presented in Table B3. A quantitative definition of level of service
for unsignalized intersections is presented in Table B4. Using this definition, Level of Service "E" is
generally considered to represent the minimum acceptable design standard.

It should be noted that the level-of-service criteria for unsignalized intersections are somewhat
different than the criteria used for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is
that drivers expect different levels of performance from different kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes than an
unsignalized intersection. Additionally, there are a number of driver behavior considerations that
combine to make delays at signalized intersections less galling than at unsignalized intersections. For
example, drivers at signalized intersections are able to relax during the red interval, while drivers on
the minor street approaches to TWSC intersections must remain attentive to the task of identifying
acceptable gaps and vehicle conflicts. Also, there is often much more variability in the amount of delay
experienced by individual drivers at unsignalized intersections than signalized intersections. For these
reasons, it is considered that the control delay threshold for any given level of service is less for an
unsignalized intersection than for a signalized intersection. While overall intersection level of service is
calculated for AWSC intersections, level of service is only calculated for the minor approaches and the
major street left turn movements at TWSC intersections. No delay is assumed to the major street
through movements. For TWSC intersections, the overall intersection level of service remains
undefined: level of service is only calculated for each minor street lane.

In the performance evaluation of TWSC intersections, it is important to consider other measures of
effectiveness (MOEs) in addition to delay, such as v/c ratios for individual movements, average queue
lengths, and 95th-percentile queue lengths. By focusing on a single MOE for the worst movement only,
such as delay for the minor-street left turn, users may make inappropriate traffic control decisions. The
potential for making such inappropriate decisions is likely to be particularly pronounced when the HCM
level-of-service thresholds are adopted as legal standards, as is the case in many public agencies.

December 26, 2012                                                                                                       Page: D-2



SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT
The APM identifies three methods for identifying seasonal adjustment factors for highway traffic
volumes. All three methods utilize information provided by Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATR) located
in select locations throughout the State Highway System. The ATRs collect traffic data 24-hours a
day/365 days a year. A preliminary evaluation of the methodologies indicated that the ATR
Characteristics Table Method is the most appropriate method for the study area.

The ATR Characteristic Table Method requires that the ATR be located on a facility that shares similar
characteristics with the facility to be adjusted, such as seasonal traffic trends, area type, and number of
lanes and OHP Classification. The ATR Characteristic Table Method also requires that the AADT
collected by the ATR must be within 10 percent of the AADT near the project area.

The ATR selected for this analysis (ATR #06-009) is located along Oregon Coast Highway No. 9 (US 101),
approximately 0.28 miles north of Coos Bay-Roseburg Highway No. 35 (OR 42). This segment of US 101
has a coastal destination seasonal traffic trend, is located on a small urban fringe, has 4 travel lanes, is
and classified as a Statewide highway, similar to Hwy 20 in Newport. The AADT at the ATR is also within
10 percent of the AADT along Hwy 20. The ATR was installed in September 1954 and has been
collecting traffic data ever since. Based on the data provided by the ATR, the Peak Month generally
occurs in July and August. Table 1 summarizes the percent of average daily traffic (ADT) reported by
the ATR for the past five years during the peak month (July/August) and the count month (December).

Note: Shaded values dropped from average calculation per ODOT methodology.


Based on the data in Table 1, average monthly factors were determined as follows:

                 Peak month average (July/August):                                (114 + 115 + 115) / 3 = 114.67
                 Count month average (December):                                  (89 + 89 + 91) / 3 = 89.67
Therefore, the east-west traffic volumes collected in December 2012 along Hwy 20 were adjusted by a
factor of 1.28 (114.67/89.67).

Date:         04 December 2012

From:         Langner

Subject:      Newport Log Yard ­ Truck Trip and Staff Trip Projections

   1. From our preliminary discussion with surrounding timberland owners in early 2012 and
      reaffirmed as recently as last week, the volume of timber diverted to a Newport timber
      operations will grow to fifty (50) truck trips per day, by year 2017. These data were developed
      by determining volume of timber to be harvested excluding volume of timber that will remain in
      the domestic market. We have preferred to provide the high end counts since beginning
      discussions with the Port of Newport and the City of Newport.
   2. At start-up, trucking volumes will be at thirty (30) truck trips (deliveries) per day.
   3. Based upon Teevin operations in Rainier, Eugene and Crabtree, Oregon, we anticipated daily
      deliveries at the following volumes during the operating day in CY 2017:
           a. 0600 ­ 0800                         12
           b. 0800 ­ 1000                         8
           c. 1000 ­ 1200                         10
           d. 1200 ­ 1400                         6
           e. 1400 ­ 1600                         10
           f. 1600 ­ 1800                         4
   4. On-site employment will average seventeen during the average day. Carpooling, use of public
      transportation, walking and bicycling will be encouraged. Again, based upon Teevin operations
      in Rainier, Eugene and Crabtree, Oregon, we anticipated daily vehicle use by employees and
      contracted service personnel at eleven (11) vehicles per day. We anticipate seven (07) vehicles
      arriving at the start of the shift (0600) and the remaining four (04) vehicles arriving between
      0600 and 0800. At the end of the shift, plan on six (06) vehicles departing between 1600 and
      1800; the remaining five (05) vehicles to depart between 1800 and 2000.

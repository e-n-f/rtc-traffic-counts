                  DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (EIR) FOR
                         PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE
              BROADWAY/MACARTHUR/SAN PABLO REDEVELOPMENT PLAN


The City of Oakland Community and Economic Development Agency, Planning and Zoning Division, is
preparing a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for Proposed Amendments to the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan ("Project" or "Proposed Amendments"), and is
requesting comments on the scope and contents of the EIR. The EIR will address the potential
environmental effects for each of the environmental topics outlined in the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). The City has not prepared an Initial Study and all CEQA topics will be addressed in the EIR.

The City of Oakland is the Lead Agency for the Project and is the public agency with the greatest
responsibility for approving the Project or carrying it out. This notice is being sent to Responsible
Agencies and other interested parties. Responsible Agencies are those public agencies, besides the City
of Oakland, that also have a role in approving or carrying out the Project. When the Draft EIR is
published, it will be sent to all Responsible Agencies and to others who respond to this NOP or who
otherwise indicate that they would like to receive a copy.

Responses to this NOP and any questions or comments should be directed in writing to: Ulla-Britt
Jonsson, Planner II, City of Oakland, Strategic Planning Division, 250 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, Suite 3315,
Oakland, CA 94612; (510) 238-3322 (phone); (510) 238-4730 (fax); or e-mailed to
ujonsson@oaklandnet.com. Comments on the NOP must be received at the above mailing or e-mail
address by 5:00 p.m. Monday April 15, 2011. Please reference environmental review case number ER11-
001 in all correspondence. Comments should focus on discussing possible impacts on the physical
environment, ways in which potential adverse effects might be minimized, and alternatives to the Project
in light of the EIR's purpose to provide useful and accurate information about such factors. In addition,
comments may be provided at the EIR Scoping Meeting to be held before the City Planning Commission
as indicated below.

PROJECT TITLE: Proposed Amendments to the Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan
("Project" or "Proposed Amendments")

CASE NO.: ER11-001

PROJECT SPONSOR: City of Oakland and Redevelopment Agency of the City of Oakland

EXISTING CONDITIONS: The Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan (Redevelopment
Plan) was adopted by the City of Oakland on July 25, 2000 and subsequently amended on March 6,
2007. The existing Redevelopment Project Area (Project Area) consists of two non-contiguous sub areas:
Broadway/MacArthur and San Pablo. Together, the two sub areas include approximately 676 acres. As
shown in the attached map, the Broadway/MacArthur sub area incorporates roughly the area between
Highway 24 and Broadway from 27th Street to 42nd Street. The San Pablo sub area incorporates a
portion of the Golden Gate neighborhood between Vallejo Street and San Pablo Avenue from 53rd to
67th streets.

The Redevelopment Plan provides the Oakland Redevelopment Agency (Agency) with the powers, duties
and obligations to implement and further its plan for the redevelopment, rehabilitation and revitalization of
the Project Area. The Redevelopment Plan contains specific measures which provide financing authority
to the Agency through activities such as collecting tax increment funds and issuing bonds. The
Redevelopment Plan also provides the authority for use of eminent domain in the Project Area through
2012.

In 2009, the City received a community petition request to have the boundaries of the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Project Area expanded to include approximately 1,300
parcels that make up the Lowell/Gaskill neighborhood (Amendment Area). These parcels are generally
built out with urban uses including an established residential neighborhood with older industrial structures
used for warehousing and manufacturing. Light industrial activities are focused along the arterial corridors
such as Stanford Avenue and Lowell Street. Many of the existing industrial structures are in disrepair and
potentially abandoned. On July 20, 2010, the City Council adopted the Lowell/Gaskill neighborhoods area
as a Redevelopment Survey Area which is being studied for the purpose of considering amending the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan to include this area.

PROJECT LOCATION: The Amendment Area covers approximately 150 acres in North Oakland,
generally between 67th Street to the north, 53rd Street to the south, San Pablo Avenue to the west, and
Adeline and Market streets to the east. The north and south borders of the Amendment Area are defined
by the city borders of Emeryville and Berkeley. (See attached map)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The proposed CEQA Project is the implementation of the three Proposed
Amendments to the Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan. The first amendment would
expand the Project Area boundaries to include the 1,300 parcels and 150 acres that is the Lowell/Gaskill
neighborhood (Amendment Area) (see attached map). Redevelopment activities envisioned for the
Amendment Area would focus in the area along Lowell Street and Stanford Avenue and include
streetscape improvements, right-of-way adjustments, building renovations, and new housing, live/work,
industrial incubator, and/or commercial development consistent with the existing HBX Housing and
Business Mix Zone and General Plan land use designation. Other redevelopment programs within the
Amendment Area would be consistent with those currently being implemented through the existing
Redevelopment Plan.

The second amendment would renew eminent domain authority for the Redevelopment Plan to extend
beyond 2012. However, the Agency does not anticipate use of eminent domain to facilitate the
redevelopment activities described above.

The third amendment would increase the bonding capacity cap to finance proposed redevelopment
activities in the Amendment Area without drawing from the existing bonding capacity which is required to
implement the existing Redevelopment Plan. The bonding capacity cap would be increased in an amount
proportional to the redevelopment needs of the Amendment Area.

City Planning Commission Agenda Item No. 6 (Lowell/Gaskill)
Agenda: http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/ceda/documents/agenda/oak026959.pdf

(On DVD at minute 2:51)

(Overview by Ulla Britt Jonsson)

Public Comment
James (Jim) Meara: Expressed appreciation for receiving notice of the hearing at his house.
Expressed strong support for project. Beautifully redeveloped area (MacArthur Transit Village is
a piece of that) and in the middle of it you've got an area where people dump trash, and speed and
shoot guns. It would be lovely to know that the city is supportive of this last little piece of
ongoing decades of work to improve this area of the East Bay.

Sanjiv Handa, East Bay News Service: Issue 1: traffic. What is going to be done to deal with
the thousands of double- and triple-parked cars? USPS, FedEx, UPS, delivery trucks, that even
when there is space to park legally, they won't do so because they don't want to risk being
blocked in. 2. Americans with Disability Act ­ when will the sidewalks be widened to
accommodate people in wheelchairs? 3. Usage of sidewalks for al fresco dining or other retail
usage, must have a minimum 60" clearance requirement and that is not being provided so what
are the steps that will be taken to do that? 4. The actual number of cars versus the guesstimates
that are being made based on the number of out of state vehicles and others that are within the
confines of this area. So if those could be addressed in the EIR that would be helpful.

Commissioner Comments
Commissioner Galvez: My question is Ms. Britt Jonsson. Are there any projects that are being
considered for this area?
Ulla Britt Jonsson: It's primarily for streetscape improvements.

Kathy Klienbaum: Primary purpose is streetscape improvements on Lowell Street, providing
basic infrastructure that is currently missing. It's likely as a redevelopment area that
(Redevelopment) will be rehabbing or demolishing and rebuilding infill housing along the Lowell
corridor. However there are no projects that are proposed or conceived of yet.

Commissioner Zayas-Mart: I just wanted to make sure that the EIR includes information on the
quality of pedestrian experience; that we look at environmental impacts in terms of stormwater
management; to look at a more integrated approach to making improvements to the street...
perhaps we can look at an EIR that is less focused on cars and moving cars through, but is more
integrated looking at the needs of pedestrians, transit, and bikes.




                                                 1
Commissioner Huntsman: My concern is when we talk about eminent domain ­ if there's no
anticipation of using it, why are we putting it in there?

Kathy Kleinbaum: The issue of eminent domain for the Lowell Street area hasn't been
determined; that would be decided by the members of the Project Area Committee. The eminent
domain proposal that is under discussion in the EIR is for the existing redevelopment area to
extend the current authority which would expire in 2012 for another 12 year, 13 year period. That
is something the PAC for the area has requested be done.

Vice-Chair Truong: I'd like know how including this wider redevelopment area would impact
low-income households? I'd like that to be studied in the EIR.




ESA Summary
    1.   Traffic, commercial vehicle parking
    2.   Sidewalks to accommodate ADA
    3.   Al fresco dining and other retail incursions into sidewalks
    4.   Traffic counts rather than traffic "guesstimates"
    5.   Pedestrian experience
    6.   Stormwater management
    7.   Integrated approach to traffic planning emphasizing needs of pedestrians, transit, bikes
    8.   Impact of Amendments on low-income households in the area
    9.   Eminent Domain should be explained in the DEIR

    County Congestion Management Program (CMP). If the proposed project is expected to
    generate at least 100 p.m. peak hour trips over existing conditions, the CMP Land Use
    Analysis Program requires the City to conduct a traffic analysis of the project using the
    Countywide Transportation Demand Model for projection years 2015 and 2035 conditions.
    Please note the following paragraph as it discusses the responsibility for modeling.

    o The CMP was amended on March 26th, 1998 so that local jurisdictions are responsible for
      conducting the model runs themselves or through a consultant. The Alameda CTC and
      ACCMA have a Countywide model that is available for this purpose. The City of
      Oakland and the ACCMA signed a Countywide Model Agreement on November 16,
      2007. Before the model can be used for this project, a letter must be submitted to the
      Alameda CTC requesting use of the model and describing the project. A copy of a
      sample letter agreement is available upon request.

    Potential impacts of the project on the Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS) need to be
    addressed. (See 2009 CMP Figure 2). The MTS roads in the city of Oakland in the project
    study area are; Grand Avenue, Broadway, Telegraph, Shattuck, Adeline, 51st Avenue,
    College Avenue, Powell, Rte. 24, I-580 and I-980.

·   The DEIR should address all potential impacts of the project on the MTS roadway and transit
    systems. These include MTS roadways as shown in the attached map as well as BART and
    AC Transit. Potential impacts of the project must be addressed for 2015 and 2035
    conditions.

    o Please note that the ACCMA and Alameda CTC have not adopted any policy for
      determining a threshold of significance for Level of Service for the Land Use Analysis
      Program of the CMP. Professional judgment should be applied to determine the
      significance of project impacts (Please see chapter 6 of 2009 CMP for more information).

    o For the purposes of CMP Land Use Analysis, 2000 Highway Capacity Manual is used.

·   The adequacy of any project mitigation measures should be discussed. On February 25, 1993,
    the ACCMA Board adopted three criteria for evaluating the adequacy of DEIR project
    mitigation measures:

    -   Project mitigation measures must be adequate to sustain CMP service standards for
        roadways and transit;
    -   Project mitigation measures must be fully funded to be considered adequate;
    -   Project mitigation measures that rely on state or federal funds directed by or influenced
        by the CMA must be consistent with the project funding priorities established in the
        Capital Improvement Program (CIP) section of the CMP or
        the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP).

    The DEIR should include a discussion on the adequacy of proposed mitigation measures
    relative to these criteria. In particular, the DEIR should detail when proposed roadway or
    transit route improvements are expected to be completed, how they will be funded, and what
    would be the effect on LOS if only the funded portions of these projects were assumed to be
    built prior to project completion.

                  REVISED NOTICE OF PREPARATION (NOP) OF A
         DRAFT SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (SEIR) FOR
                       PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE
            BROADWAY/MACARTHUR/SAN PABLO REDEVELOPMENT PLAN


The City of Oakland Community and Economic Development Agency, Planning and Zoning Division, is
preparing a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) for Proposed Amendments to the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan ( "Proposed Amendments"), and is requesting
comments on the scope and contents of the SEIR. The SEIR will Supplement the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan EIR (File No. ER 99-06, State Clearinghouse No.
99052061, certified on July 25, 2000). The SEIR will describe and analyze the changes to the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan (i.e. the Proposed Amendments) and will address
the potential environmental effects of these changes for each of the environmental topics outlined in the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The City has not prepared an Initial Study and all CEQA
topics will be addressed in the SEIR.

The City of Oakland is the Lead Agency for the Project and is the public agency with the greatest
responsibility for approving the Project or carrying it out. On March 16, 2011, the City of Oakland
distributed an NOP for the preparation of Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Project. The City
provided a 30-day comment period for the receipt of written responses, comments and/or questions on
the NOP and an EIR Scoping Meeting was held before the City Planning Commission on April 6, 2011.
During this time, one written and six oral comments were received on the original NOP. This revised NOP
is issued only to specify that the City will prepare an SEIR, rather than a Draft EIR, as previously noticed
in the NOP dated March 16, 2011. This notice is being sent to Responsible Agencies and other interested
parties. Responsible Agencies are those public agencies, besides the City of Oakland, that also have a
role in approving or carrying out the Project. When the Draft SEIR is published, it will be sent to all
Responsible Agencies and to others who responded to the original NOP published in March 16, 2011
and/or to this revised NOP, or who otherwise indicate that they would like to receive a copy.

Responses to this NOP and any questions or comments should be directed in writing to: Ulla-Britt
Jonsson, Planner II, City of Oakland, Strategic Planning Division, 250 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, Suite 3315,
Oakland, CA 94612; (510) 238-3322 (phone); (510) 238-4730 (fax); or e-mailed to
ujonsson@oaklandnet.com. Comments on the NOP must be received at the above mailing or e-mail
address by 5:00 p.m. Monday July 18, 2011. Please reference environmental review case number ER11-
001 in all correspondence. Comments should focus on discussing possible impacts on the physical
environment, ways in which potential adverse effects might be minimized, and alternatives to the Project
in light of the SEIR's purpose to provide useful and accurate information about such factors.


PROJECT TITLE: Proposed Amendments to the Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan (
"Proposed Amendments")

CASE NO.: ER11-001




                                                    Page 1 of 3
PROJECT SPONSOR: City of Oakland and Redevelopment Agency of the City of Oakland

EXISTING CONDITIONS: The Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan (Redevelopment
Plan) was adopted by the City of Oakland on July 25, 2000 and subsequently amended on March 6,
2007. The existing Redevelopment Project Area (Project Area) consists of two non-contiguous subareas:
Broadway/MacArthur and San Pablo. Together, the two subareas include approximately 676 acres. As
shown in the attached map, the Broadway/MacArthur subarea incorporates roughly the area between
Highway 24 and Broadway from 27th Street to 42nd Street. The San Pablo subarea incorporates a
portion of the Golden Gate neighborhood between Vallejo Street and San Pablo Avenue from 53rd to
67th streets.

The Redevelopment Plan provides the Oakland Redevelopment Agency (Agency) with the powers, duties
and obligations to implement and further its plan for the redevelopment, rehabilitation and revitalization of
the Project Area. The Redevelopment Plan contains specific measures which provide financing authority
to the Agency through activities such as collecting tax increment funds and issuing bonds. The
Redevelopment Plan also provides the authority for use of eminent domain in the Project Area through
2012.

In 2009, the City received a community petition request to have the boundaries of the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Project Area expanded to include approximately 1,300
parcels that make up the Lowell/Gaskill neighborhood (Amendment Area). These parcels are generally
built out with urban uses including an established residential neighborhood with older industrial structures
used for warehousing and manufacturing. Light industrial activities are focused along the arterial corridors
such as Stanford Avenue and Lowell Street. Many of the existing industrial structures are in disrepair and
potentially abandoned. On July 20, 2010, the City Council adopted the Lowell/Gaskill neighborhoods area
as a Redevelopment Survey Area which is being studied for the purpose of considering amending the
Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan to include this area.

PROJECT LOCATION: The Amendment Area covers approximately 150 acres in North Oakland,
generally between 67th Street to the north, 53rd Street to the south, San Pablo Avenue to the west, and
Adeline and Market streets to the east. The north and south borders of the Amendment Area are defined
by the city borders of Emeryville and Berkeley. (See attached map)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The proposed CEQA Project is the implementation of the three Proposed
Amendments to the Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan. The first amendment would
expand the Project Area boundaries to include the 1,300 parcels and 150 acres that is the Lowell/Gaskill
neighborhood (Amendment Area) (see attached map). Redevelopment activities envisioned for the
Amendment Area would focus in the area along Lowell Street and Stanford Avenue and include
streetscape improvements, right-of-way adjustments, building renovations, and new housing, live/work,
industrial incubator, and/or commercial development consistent with the existing HBX Housing and
Business Mix Zone and General Plan land use designation. Other redevelopment programs within the
Amendment Area would be consistent with those currently being implemented through the existing
Redevelopment Plan.

The second amendment would extend eminent domain authority for the Redevelopment Plan beyond
2012. However, the Agency does not anticipate use of eminent domain to facilitate the redevelopment
activities described above.

The third amendment would increase the bonding capacity cap to finance proposed redevelopment
activities in the Amendment Area without drawing from the existing bonding capacity which is required to
implement the existing Redevelopment Plan. The bonding capacity cap would be increased in an amount
proportional to the redevelopment needs of the Amendment Area.

The SEIR will analyze the effects of changes in the environment resulting from the Proposed
Amendments to the Broadway/MacArthur/San Pablo Redevelopment Plan (and implementation of
redevelopment project activities resulting from those amendments.

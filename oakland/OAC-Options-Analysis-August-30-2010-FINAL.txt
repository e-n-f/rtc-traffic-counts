Executive Summary

PROJECT PURPOSE

This  report  provides  an  updated  and  expanded  analysis  of  options  for  the  Oakland  Airport 
Connector.  The  options  studied  consist  of  No  Action  (retain  existing  AirBART  service),  Rapid  Bus, 
Full  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT),  and  Automated  Guideway  Transit  (AGT).  The  Rapid  Bus  and  Full 
BRT  configurations  analyzed  in  this  report  have  not  been  studied  previously  and  incorporate 
information  about  BRT  service  that  was  not  available  at  the  time  the  Final  Environmental  Impact 
Report/Final  Environment  Impact  Statement  (FEIR/FEIS)  for  the  Oakland  Airport  Connector  was 
completed  in  2002.  In  addition,  the  report  updates  information  for  the  No Action  and AGT  options 
based on the most uptodate data available.  
The intent of this report is to inform current discussions on the Oakland Airport Connector through 
a  valid  comparison  of  the  four  key  modal  options.  Subsequent  to  the  certification  of  the  FEIR/FEIS, 
there  has  been  a  considerable  drop  in  airline  passenger  volumes  at  Oakland  International  Airport, 
the shift of some flights to San Francisco International Airport, a significant reduction in projections 
of  future  airline  passenger  volumes  at  the  airport,  and  other  factors.   This  report  uses  BART's  most 
recent  passenger  volume  forecasts  for  2013  (assumed  year  of  project  opening)  and  2030,  and  also 
looks  at  ridership  under  conditions  when  the  airport  has  reached  the  maximum  number  of  annual 
passengers it can serve (approximately 30 million annual passengers). 
The report also uses the most uptodate information on road conditions and analysis using BART's 
selected AGT option.  Compared to the AGT option in the 2002 FEIR/FEIS, the AGT Project selected 
by  BART  has  a  top  speed  of  31  MPH  instead  of  45  MPH,  has  longer  walk  distances,  and  does  not 
include the two intermediate stops. 


OVERVIEW OF NEW ALTERNATIVES

According  to  the  Bus  Rapid  Transit  Practitioner's  Guide  published  by  the  Transportation  Research 
Board,  BRT  is  "a  flexible,  high  performance  rapid  transit  mode  that  combines  a  variety  of  physical, 
operating  and  system  elements  into  a  permanently  integrated  system  with  a  quality  image  and 
unique identity." BRT can incorporate various combinations of the following features: 
    ·    Running ways (operations in mixed traffic, bus lanes, gradeseparated busways); 
    ·    Highquality stations with passenger amenities; 
    ·    Distinctive vehicles; 
    ·    Efficient fare collection; 
    ·    Technology  that  provides  passenger  information,  interacts  with  traffic  signal  systems,  and 
         so on; 
    ·    Frequent, allday service; and 
    ·    Distinctive system identity.

Executive Summary


The "Quality Bus" option analyzed in the 2002 FEIR/FEIS included the following BRT components: 
    ·    Integration with BART's ticketing system (i.e., offboard fare payment); 
    ·    Bus  boarding  and  alighting  through  all  doors  (speeding  up  the  time  to  load  and  unload 
         passengers); 
    ·    Dedicated  bus  stop  at  the  Coliseum/Oakland  Airport  BART  station  in  proximity  to  a  new 
         station entrance, providing quick bus access to and from Hegenberger Road;  
    ·    Lowfloor, articulated buses equipped with luggage racks; 
    ·    Fourminute headways between buses, with service hours identical to the BART system; 
    ·    Signal priority at signalized intersections (holding a green signal a few seconds longer when 
         needed  to  allow  buses  to  get  through  an  intersection,  and  returning  to  green  a  few  seconds 
         earlier if a bus is already stopped at the intersection); and 
    ·    An exclusive bus lane at the airport terminal, leading to the airport bus stop. 

This  report  studies  two  additional  options  that  reflect  two  variations  of  true  BRT  service  that  are 
designed to address the deficiencies that the FEIR/FEIS identified with the Quality Bus option. 
The  first  option,  Rapid  Bus,  is  designed  as  a  relatively  lowcost  form  of  BRT  that  could  be 
implemented  relatively  quickly,  as  it  does  not  require  major  physical  changes  to  existing  streets, 
other  than  signing  and  striping  changes  and  changes  to  traffic  signal  equipment.  Rapid  Bus 
includes all of the features of the Quality Bus option listed above, plus the following: 
    ·    Curbside  bus  lanes  along  Hegenberger  Road  and  Airport  Access  Road  that  would  also  be 
         open to use by rightturning traffic; 
    ·    Queue  jump  signal  phasing  at  the  ends  of  bus  lanes,  to  give  buses  a  head  start  on  other 
         traffic traveling in the same direction; 
    ·    Direct access to the farepaid area of the Coliseum BART station; and 
    ·    A  secure,  climatecontrolled  waiting  area  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  with  monitors 
         displaying the time of the next bus departure to the airport. 

The  second  option,  Full  BRT,  is  designed  as  a  moreextensive  BRT  option  that  provides  additional 
travel  time  and  reliability  improvements  compared  to  the  Rapid  Bus  option,  at  an  additional  cost. 
Full BRT includes all of the features of the Quality Bus option listed above, plus the following: 
    ·    Bus  lanes  in  the  median  of  Hegenberger  Road  for  use  exclusively  by  Oakland  Airport 
         Connector buses; 
    ·    A curbside bus lane on Airport Access Road that could also be used by rightturning traffic; 
    ·    A  flyover  that  would  bridge  the  Hegenberger  Road/South  Coliseum  Way  intersection, 
         allowing  buses  and  Hegenberger  through  traffic  to  avoid  traffic  signal  delays  at  all  times, 
         and avoid special event traffic delays during Coliseum events.

Executive Summary


Any  number  of  other  options  could  conceivably  be  developed  from  mixtures  of  these  two  options; 
however,  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT  represent  reasonable  ends  of  the  BRT  spectrum  in  terms  of 
service attributes and costs. 


COMPARISON OF FOUR ALTERNATIVES

    ·    AirBART:    AirBART  provides  a  low  operating  cost  connection  from  the  Coliseum  BART 
         station  to  the  Oakland Airport.  However,  it  does  not  meet  comparison  criteria  requirements 
         related  to  frequency,  reliability,  capacity,  supporting  the  OIA  Master  Plan,  and  flexibility  to 
         serve  intermediate  stops,  providing  access  to  the  local  community  which  includes 
         significant  populations  of  minority  and  lowincome  residents.   This  indicates  that AirBART 
         is  not  a  viable  long  term  solution,  and  supports  the  need  for  an  alternative  mode  of 
         operation.  
    ·    Rapid  Bus:  This  option  provides  a  significant  improvement  over  the  existing  AirBART 
         service, with more frequent, faster service that could be implemented by 2012. Overall travel 
         times  are  equal  to  AGT  in  2013,  as  this  option  provides  shorter  transfer  and  walk  times, 
         despite  having  a  longer  invehicle  trip  between  BART  and  the  airport.  In  2030,  Rapid  Bus 
         loses  its  advantage  and  is  1.6  minutes  slower  than  AGT.   It  is  slower  than  Full  BRT  in  2013 
         and  in  2030.    Of  the  three  new  alternatives,  Rapid  Bus  is  the  most  costeffective  option  at 
         $6.83  per  new  ride,  based  on  the  Federal  Transit  Administration's  (FTA)  New  Starts  cost
         effectiveness  criterion.  Because  it  uses  a  curbside  dedicated  lane,  Rapid  Bus  is  the  most 
         flexible  in  adding  stops  to  support  local  economic  development  plans  and  serve  the  local 
         community. However, Rapid Bus does not meet the reliability criterion, has a slightly higher 
         operating  subsidy  per  ride  than  Full  BRT  ($2.33  for  Rapid  Bus  compared  to  $1.95  for  Full 
         BRT),  and  attracts  fewer  rides  than  either  Full  BRT  or  AGT  at  a  $3  fare.    Rapid  Bus  has 
         higher estimated ridership than AGT, however, with a $6 fare for AGT. 
    ·    Full  BRT:  Full  BRT  provides  significant  improvements  over  Rapid  Bus,  with  more  reliable 
         service,  requiring  only  a  4minute  buffer  for  reliability  under  normal  operating  conditions.  
         Like  AGT,  Full  BRT  is  not  affected  by  events  at  the  Coliseum,  due  to  the  construction  of  a 
         flyover  bridge  on  Hegenberger  at  South  Coliseum  Way.  Full  BRT  has  lower  walk  times  than 
         AGT  at  both  the  Coliseum  BART  station  and  the  Oakland Airport  terminal  which  results  in 
         an  overall  faster  total  trip  time  compared  to  AGT.  Due  to  these  operational  improvements 
         and  the  shorter  walk  time  from  the  station  to  the  Oakland  Airport  terminal,  Full  BRT  has 
         ridership  comparable  to AGT  in  2013  and  2030,  using  a  $3  fare.  Using  the  current  planning 
         assumption  of  a  $6  fare  for AGT,  Full  BRT  has  approximately  13%  higher  ridership  than  the 
         AGT  option. Assuming  a  $3  fare,  the  Full  BRT  costeffectiveness  measure  of  $15.86  per  new 
         ride is significantly lower than for the AGT (see discussion below). Through the flexibility to 
         have  two  local  stops,  this  option  provides  more  support  to  economic  development  plans 
         and  local  communities.   Full  BRT  also  has  the  lowest  operating  cost  per  ride,  and  therefore 
         the  lowest  subsidy  per  ride  required,  at  $1.95.   Overall,  this  option  at  least  minimally  meets 
         all comparison criteria. 
    ·    AGT:  Due  to  the  separated  guideway,  AGT  is  the  strongest  of  all  options  in  terms  of 
         reliability.    As  a  result  of  the  level  of  construction  required,  AGT  would  be  operational  in

Oakland Airport Connector Options Analysis                                                                   August 2010
Executive Summary


         2014,  compared  to  2012  for  Rapid  Bus  and  2013  for  Full  BRT.    Ridership  is  comparable  to 
         Full BRT with a $3 fare, and approximately 13% lower than Full BRT when using a fare of $6 
         for  AGT.  The  operating  cost  per  ride  is  the  highest  of  all  options,  which  leads  to  a  subsidy 
         per  ride  of  $10.76  at  a  $3  fare  and  $9.85  with  a  $6  fare.  Using  2002  FEIR/FEIS  capital  cost  of 
         $204  million,  the  costefficiency  rating  for AFT  is  $37.97  cost  per  incremental  ride  with  a  $3 
         fare  and  $53.74  with  a  $6  fare.  Estimating  the  annual  capital  costs  for  the  current  $459 
         million  project  increases  the  costeffectiveness  measure  to  $68.17  per  incremental  ride  if  the 
         fare  is  $3,  and  $102.74  per  incremental  ride  if  the  fare  is  $6.  The  station  at  the  airport  will 
         displace  airport  parking,  while  all  other  options  have  very  minimal  impact  on  parking  or 
         potential  future  development  at  the  airport.  AGT  has  the  least  amount  of  flexibility  in 
         additional  stations.  One  optional  station  is  possible  at  Doolittle,  in  conjunction  with  the 
         maintenance  facility,  but  no  additional  stations  are  feasible  without  a  significant  redesign  of 
         the  system.    As  a  result,  the  AGT  minimally  meets  the  evaluation  criteria  for  flexibility  to 
         serve intermediate stops and improve access for the local community, and support economic 
         development plans.  
    ·    Summary  Tables:  A  summary  of  the  comparison  criteria  for  the  four  options  is  provided  in 
         the  two  tables  on  the  following  pages.  The  Comparison  Criteria  Matrix  is  based  upon  the 
         measures  from  the  2002  FEIR/FEIS.  The  Additional  Evaluation  Criteria  are  new  criteria 
         added  for  this  project.  The  comparison  criteria  are  explained  in  detail  in  Section  5  of  the 
         report. 


CONCLUSION

The  overall  best  option,  based  on  the  comparison  criteria,  is  Full  BRT.  It  has  a  higher  level  of 
ridership  than  AGT  when  assuming  the  planned  fares  of  $3  for  Full  BRT  and  $6  for  AGT,  a  lower 
subsidy  per  ride  and  significantly  lower  cost  per  incremental  ride.  Total  travel  time  is  faster  than 
AGT,  including  walk  and  invehicle  time.  While  travelers  would  need  to  consider  budgeting  an 
extra  4  minutes  for  their  trip  in  case  of  longerthannormal  travel  times  due  to  lower  reliability  on 
Full  BRT,  this  time  is  likely  inconsequential  in  comparison  to  total  transit  travel  time  and  buffer 
time  required  for  airport  security  and  other  flight  considerations.  Like  AGT,  the  Full  BRT  option 
would  not  be  affected  by  events  at  the  Coliseum.  The  Full  BRT  option  is  more  flexible  than AGT  in 
its  ability  to  serve  intermediate  stations  that  can  support  economic  development  and  provide 
improved  service  to  the  local  community  which  includes  a  large  population  of  lowincome  and 
minority riders.  
It  is  possible  to  have  a  phased  implementation  of  Full  BRT  so  that   transit  signal  priority  and  fare 
payment  improvements  occur  relatively  quickly,  allowing  some  of  the  benefits  to  occur  during 
construction of the Full BRT system.

Project Overview

PROJECT PURPOSE

This  report  providers  an  updated  and  expanded  analysis  of  options  for  the  Oakland  Airport 
Connector.  The  options  studied  consist  of  No  Build,  Rapid  Bus,  Full  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT),  and 
Automated  Guideway  Transit  (AGT).  The  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT  options  have  not  been  studied 
previously  and  incorporate  information  about  BRT  service  that  was  not  available  at  the  time  the 
Final  Environmental  Impact  Report/Final  Environment  Impact  Statement  (FEIR/FEIS)  for  the 
Oakland Airport  Connector  was  completed  in  2002.  In  addition,  the  report  updates  information  for 
the No Build and AGT options based on the most uptodate data available.  
The  intent  of  this  project  is  to  inform  current  discussions  on  the  Oakland  Airport  Connector 
through  a  valid  comparison  of  the  four  key  modal  options.  Since  the  certification  of  the  FEIR  and 
the  selection  of  the  preferred  alternative  by  the  BART  Board  of  Directors  in  2002,  rising  costs  and 
changes  to  the  configuration  of  the  preferred  option,  improvements  to  the  road  corridor,  and 
reductions  in  airport  passenger  projections  have  significantly  reduced  the  potential  benefits  and 
increased  the  costs  associated  with  BART's  preferred  alternative  relative  to  other  options.  Changes 
to  the  AGT  option  have  included  the  removal  of  intermediate  stations,  lowering  the  minimum 
acceptable top speed from 45 mph down to 27 mph, a potential increase in fares to as much as twice 
the  current  AirBART  fare,  and  locating  both  the  Coliseum  BART  and  airport  AGT  stations  farther 
away  than  originally  planned.  BART  updated  its  ridership  projections  for  the  No  Action  and  AGT 
options,  but  not  the  Quality  Bus  option,  in  2005,  2007,  and  2009  (References  1,  2,  3),  incorporating 
some  of  the  changes  to  the  preferred  AGT  Alternative,  along  with  updated  airport  passenger 
projections. 


BACKGROUND ON THE OAKLAND AIRPORT CONNECTOR

The  Oakland  Airport  Connector  is  a  planned  3.2mile  public  transit  link  between  the  Bay  Area 
Rapid Transit (BART) Coliseum/Oakland Airport station and the Oakland International Airport that 
would  replace  existing  AirBART  bus  service.  This  link  has  been  discussed  and  studied  since  the 
early  1970s.  It  has  been  identified  as  a  regional  priority  for  over  ten  years  and  was  brought  before 
Alameda  County  voters  as  one  project  in  package  of  improvements  for  a  transportation  sales  tax 
initiative in November 2000 under Measure B. The project was estimated to cost $130 million at that 
time.  The  BART  Board  of  Directors  certified  its  FEIR/FEIS  for  the  project  in  2002.  The  FEIR/FEIS 
analyzed three alternatives: 
    ·    No Action, continuing the existing AirBART service; 
    ·    Quality  Bus,  an  option  that  improved  the  connection  between  BART  and  bus  at  the 
         Coliseum BART station and provided signal priority for buses on Hegenberger Road; and 
    ·    Automated  Guideway  Transit  (AGT),  an  automated,  completely  gradeseparated  link 
         between BART and the airport.

Project Overview


While  the  Quality  Bus  option  was  assessed  as  the  most  costeffective  option  in  terms  of  cost  per 
new ride, AGT was selected as the preferred alternative because it:  
    ·    Allowed for improved ontime performance and reliability; 
    ·    Provided a quicker travel time than the other options and driving; 
    ·    Produced the highest ridership for the link and the greatest increase in BART ridership; and 
    ·    Assisted  economic  development  on  Hegenberger,  consistent  with  Oakland  General  Plan 
         goals and BART expansion policies, through the provision of intermediate stations. 

The March 2002 FEIR/FEIS showed capital costs of $204 million for the AGT alternative. 
In  December  2009,  BART  selected  the  Flatiron/Parsons  Joint  Venture  to  design  and  construct  the 
OAC  project  at  a  total  cost  of  $492  million,  including  $34  million  that  BART  had  already  spent  on 
the project. In February 2010, after investigation of a formal complaint filed by Public Advocates, on 
behalf  of  TransForm,  Urban  Habitat  Program,  and  Genesis,  the  FTA  found  the  project  to  be  non
compliant  with  their  requirements  related  to  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights Act,  causing  FTA  to  revoke 
the $70.0 million ARRA grant.   
A  revised  funding  plan  was  brought  to  the  BART  Board  of  Directors  meeting  in  July  2010.  The 
project  was  reduced  to  $484  million  (after  an  $8  million  reduction  in  contingency)  with 
contributions from the following agencies and funding programs (4): 
    ·    Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts Grant: $25.0 million 
    ·    State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP): $20.7 million 
    ·    MTC/State Local Partnership Program: $20.0 million 
    ·    MTC/PTMISEA (Proposition 1B): $12.8 million 
    ·    RTIP Funding Exchange (CMIA and SHOPP): $20.0 million 
    ·    HighSpeed Passenger Train Bond: $5.4 million 
    ·    Alameda County Measure B ½ cent sales tax: $89.1 million 
    ·    Port of Oakland Passenger Facility Charges: $29.3 million 
    ·    MTC Regional Measure 1 & 2 Bridge Tolls: $146.2 million 
    ·    BART SFO Reserve Account: $10.0 million 
    ·    Debt draws: $105.7 million 

The BART Board adopted the funding plan, and made award of the contract contingent on securing 
the FTA Small Starts grant, State STIP funds, and Port of Oakland Passenger Facility Charges. 


DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES

Although  an  improved  "Quality  Bus"  option  was  analyzed  by  the  FEIR/FEIS,  none  of  the  major 
planning  studies  to  date  have  addressed  true  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT).  This  can  be  attributed  at 
least  in  part  to  a  lack  of  information  on  this  mode.  Although  freeway  and  buswaybased  express

Project Overview


bus  systems  have  existed  in  North America  since  the  1970s  and  BRT  systems  have  been  developed 
in  other  parts  of  the  world,  it  has  only  been  in  the  last  decade  that  numerous  surfacerunning  BRT 
routes and systems have been developed in North America, spurred in part in the U.S. by increased 
federal  funding  assistance.  Since  the  FEIR/FEIS  was  produced  in  2002,  several  major  federally 
funded  studies  of  the  characteristics,  benefits,  and  costs  of  BRT  have  been  produced,  including  two 
editions of Characteristics of Bus Rapid Transit (8, 9), and the Bus Rapid Transit Practitioner's Guide (10). 
These  reports  provide  uptodate  information  on  BRT,  based  on  the  experiences  of  numerous  BRT 
routes  and  systems  around  the  U.S.  and  Canada,  and  have  been  used  as  source  documents  for 
estimating  the  ridership,  travel  time,  and  reliability  characteristics  of  the  two  BRT  options  studied 
in this report. 
Bus Rapid Transit has been described as: 
    "A  flexible,  high  performance  rapid  transit  mode  that  combines  a  variety  of  physical,  operating  and 
    system elements into a permanently integrated system with a quality image and unique identity. This 
    definition  highlights  BRT's  flexibility  and  the  fact  that  it  encompasses  a  wide  variety  of  applications, 
    each  one  tailored  to  a  particular  set  of  travel  markets  and  physical  environments.  BRT's  flexibility 
    derives  from  the  fact  that  BRT  vehicles  (e.g.,  buses,  specialized  BRT  vehicles)  can  travel  anywhere 
    there  is  pavement  and  the  fact  that  BRT's  basic  service  unit,  a  single  vehicle,  is  relatively  small 
    compared  to  trainbased  rapid  transit  modes.  A  given  BRT  corridor  application  might  encompass 
    route  segments  where  vehicles  operate  both  in  mixed  traffic  and  on  a  dedicated,  fully  grade
    separated  transitway  with  major  stations.  BRT  is  an  integrated  system  that  is  [designed]  to  improve 
    the speed, reliability, and identity of bus transit." (9) 

Bus Rapid Transit can include many different combinations of components, including: (10) 
    ·    Running ways (mixed traffic, bus lanes, gradeseparated busways); 
    ·    Highquality stations with passenger amenities; 
    ·    Distinctive vehicles; 
    ·    Efficient fare collection; 
    ·    Technological  features  that  provide  passenger  information,  interact  with  traffic  signal 
         systems, etc.; 
    ·    Frequent, allday service; and 
    ·    Distinctive system identity. 

The "Quality Bus" option analyzed in the FEIR/FEIS (11) included the following BRT components: 
    ·    Integration with BART's ticketing system (i.e., offboard fare payment); 
    ·    Bus  boarding  and  alighting  through  all  doors  (speeding  up  the  time  to  load  and  unload 
         passengers); 
    ·    Dedicated  bus  stop  at  BART  in  proximity  to  a  new  station  entrance,  providing  quick  bus 
         access to and from Hegenberger Road; 
    ·    Lowfloor, articulated buses equipped with luggage racks; 
    ·    Fourminute headways between buses, with service hours identical to the BART system;

    ·    An exclusive bus lane at the airport terminal, leading to the airport bus stop. 

BART's  2002  FEIR/FEIS  determined  that  the  Quality  Bus  option  would  be  slower  than  the  AGT 
option when total trip times were compared, that it would be subject to increased travel times in the 
future  as  traffic  congestion  increased,  that  it  would  be  more  subject  to  variability  in  travel  times 
under  normal  operations,  and  that  it  could  be  slowed  down  considerably  by  special  event  traffic 
from  the  Coliseum,  although  it  also  noted  possible  ways  for  addressing  potential  special  event 
delays. 
This  report  studies  two  additional  options  that  reflect  two  variations  of  BRT  service  that  are 
designed to address the deficiencies that the FEIR/FEIS identified with the Quality Bus option. 
The  first  option,  Rapid  Bus,  is  designed  as  a  relatively  lowcost  BRT  route  that  could  be 
implemented  relatively  quickly,  as  it  does  not  require  major  physical  changes  to  existing  streets, 
other  than  signing  and  striping  changes  and  changes  to  traffic  signal  equipment.  The  component 
with the longest construction time would be the construction of the Rapid Bus stop at the Coliseum 
BART station. Rapid Bus includes all of the features of the Quality Bus option listed above, plus the 
following additional features: 
    ·    Exclusive  bus  lanes  along  Hegenberger  Road  and  Airport  Access  Road  (mostly  curbside) 
         that could also be used by rightturning traffic; 
    ·    Queue  jump  signal  phasing  at  the  ends  of  bus  lanes,  to  give  buses  a  head  start  on  other 
         traffic traveling in the same direction; 
    ·    Direct  access  to  the  farepaid  area  of  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  through  the  use  of 
         platform screen doors to control access between buses and the station; 
    ·    A  secure,  climatecontrolled  waiting  area  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  with  monitors 
         displaying the time of the next bus departure to the airport: and 
    ·    Raised stops to provide level boarding platforms at all stops/stations. 

The  second  option,  Full  BRT,  is  designed  as  a  moreextensive  BRT  option  that  provides  additional 
travel  time  and  reliability  improvements  compared  to  the  Rapid  Bus  option,  at  an  additional  cost. 
Full  BRT  includes  all  of  the  features  of  the  Quality  Bus  option  listed  above,  plus  the  following 
additional features: 
    ·    Bus  lanes  in  the  median  of  Hegenberger  Road  for  use  exclusively  by  Oakland  Airport 
         Connector buses; 
    ·    A curbside bus lane on Airport Access Road that could also be used by rightturning traffic; 
    ·    A  flyover  that  would  bridge  the  Hegenberger  Road/South  Coliseum  Way  intersection, 
         allowing  buses  and  Hegenberger  through  traffic  to  avoid  traffic  signal  delays  at  all  times, 
         and avoid special event traffic delays during Coliseum events;

Project Overview


    ·    Queue  jump  signal  phasing  at  the  ends  of  bus  lanes,  to  give  buses  a  head  start  on  other 
         traffic traveling in the same direction; 
    ·    Direct  access  to  the  farepaid  area  of  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  through  the  use  of 
         platform screen doors to control access between buses and the station; 
    ·    A  secure,  climatecontrolled  waiting  area  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  with  monitors 
         displaying the time of the next bus departure to the airport; and 
    ·    Raised stops to provide level boarding platforms at all stops/stations. 

Any  number  of  other  options  could  conceivably  be  developed  from  mixtures  of  these  two  options; 
however,  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT  represent  reasonable  ends  of  the  BRT  spectrum  in  terms  of 
service attributes and costs. 
Since  the  time  the  FEIR/FEIS  was  developed,  other  changes  have  occurred.  One  significant  change 
is  the  opening  of  an  improved  connection  from  I880  to  the  airport  via  98th  Avenue,  including  the 
elimination  of  several  traffic  signals  on  airport  property  and  the  widening  of  Airport  Drive  both 
leading to and at the airport terminal. While these reconfigurations were included in traffic analysis 
in  the  FEIR/FEIS,  the  improvements  have  provided  a  significantly  greater  benefit  than  originally 
assumed  by  providing  an  alternative  access  route  to  Hegenberger  Road.  Combined  with  changes 
on  Airport  property  that  were  not  included  in  the  FEIR/FEIS  study,  these  projects  have  greatly 
eased  traffic  congestion  on  airport  property.  This  report  accounts  for  these  improvements  by  using 
current  traffic  volumes  on  Hegenberger  Road  as  a  starting  point  for  its  traffic  analysis,  and  then 
increasing  volumes  in  the  future  based  on  the  latest  airport  passenger  forecast  ranges  that  BART  is 
using  for  the  Oakland Airport  Connector  project  and  other  background  traffic  growth  unrelated  to 
the airport. 
The  other  significant  change  is  a  considerable  drop  in  passenger  volumes  at  the  airport,  resulting 
from  the  current  downturn  in  the  economy,  the  movement  of  some  flights  to  San  Francisco 
International  Airport,  and  other  factors.  To  allow  applestoapples  comparisons,  this  report  uses 
BART's  most  recent  passenger  volume  forecasts  for  both  2013  (assumed  year  of  project  opening) 
and  2030,  but  also  includes  sensitivity  analyses  that  address  other  assumptions,  including  looking 
at  ridership  under  conditions  when  the  Oakland  Airport  has  reached  the  maximum  number  of 
annual passengers it can serve (approximately 30 million annual passengers). 


REPORT SCOPE

Because the No Action and AGT options have already been described in detail in the FEIR/FEIS and 
followup  reports,  this  report  focuses  on  presenting  the  analysis  related  to  the  two  new  options, 
Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT.  Section  3  summarizes  the  characteristics  of  the  four  options,  with  most  of 
the  detail  focused  on  the  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT  options.  Section  4  presents  the  analysis  of  the 
ridership,  travel  time,  reliability,  cost,  job  creation,  and  other  attributes  of  the  Rapid  Bus  and  Full 
BRT  options,  including  details  of  the  methodologies  used.  Section  5  presents  the  evaluation  criteria 
used  in  the  FEIR/FEIS  to  evaluate  the  different  options,  and  compares  the  four  options  based  on 
these  criteria  (using  the  most  recent  information  available),  along  with  additional  comparison 
criteria developed for this project. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the results and presents the report's

conclusions.  Appendices  to  the  report  present  the  traffic  analysis  results  and  present  concepts  for 
the Rapid Bus and Full BRT routes and stations. 
For  ease  of  comparison,  the  base  analysis  presents  each  option  as  a  nonstop  route  between  BART 
and  the  airport,  and  assumes  that  each  option  has  the  same  fare  as  the  current  AirBART  service. 
Section  4  then  supplements  this  analysis  with  additional  analyses  relating  fare  levels  and  their 
potential impact on ridership; operating subsidies; the feasibility, cost, and ridership implications of 
intermediate  stations;  flexibility  to  serve  a  future  third  terminal  at  the  airport;  and  the  ability  to 
serve the local community providing improved access to BART.  
This  analysis  has  been  conducted  at  a  planning  level,  sufficient  to  allow  a  fair  comparison  to  be 
made  of  the  four  options,  including  the  determination  of  the  feasibility  and  orderofmagnitude 
costs  of  each  option.  However,  it  is  not  intended  to  substitute  for  a  full  preliminary  engineering 
assessment of the Rapid Bus and Full BRT options.

Descriptions of the Options
Four  options  are  assessed  by  this  report.  The  No  Action  (AirBART)  and  locally  preferred 
(Automated  Guideway  Transit)  options  have  been  included  from  the  March  2002  FEIR/FEIS  (11). 
The  study  includes  two  new  options:  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT).  Detailed 
conceptual street crosssections are provided in Appendix B. 


NO ACTION (RETAIN AIRBART)

This  option  retains  the  existing  AirBART  service.  AirBART  operates  approximately  every  10 
minutes  during  peak  periods  and  travels  nonstop  between  a  stop  on  the  third  curb  between 
Terminals  1  and  2  at  the  Oakland  Airport  and  a  stop  adjacent  to  the  main  entrance  to  the 
Coliseum/Oakland  Airport  BART  station.  Passengers  pay  an  exact  cash  fare,  can  insert  a  pre
purchased  $3  BART  ticket  into  the  farebox  as  payment,  or  can  purchase  a  ticket  at  new  AirBART 
ticket  machines  at  the  Airport.  AirBART  uses  40foot  lowfloor  buses  providing  32  seats  and 
luggage  racks.  Passengers  must  board  through  the  front  door  to  pay  their  fare,  but  may  exit 
through  either  the  front  or  rear  doors.  Figure  1  depicts  the  existing  AirBART  service  at  the 
Coliseum BART station. 
Figure  2  shows  the  AirBART  route.  Leaving  the  Coliseum  BART  bus  stop,  the  bus  travels  to  the 
airport  via  San  Leandro  Street,  66th  Avenue,  Oakport  Street,  Edgewater  Drive,  Hegenberger  Road, 
and Airport Drive. An optional route is also used at the discretion of AirBART, depending on traffic 
conditions, that uses 69th Avenue, Snell Street, 75th Avenue, and San Leandro Street to travel around 
the BART station to access Hegenberger Road. The optional route crosses the Union Pacific railroad 
tracks  twice  in  the  process;  however,  as  of  2003,  only  one  freight  train  a  day  used  the  tracks  (12). 
Returning to BART, the bus travels via Airport Drive, Airport Access Road, Hegenberger Road, and 
San  Leandro  Street.  The  bus  travels  in  mixed  traffic  the  entire  way,  meaning  that  the  bus  is  fully 
exposed  to any  traffic  congestion  that  may  exist  along  the  way,  including  special  event  traffic  at  the 
Coliseum.

AUTOMATED GUIDEWAY TRANSIT (AGT)

This  option  represents  BART's  current  preferred  alternative  for  the  Oakland  Airport  Connector. 
Under  this  option,  automated  vehicles  would  operate  along  a  mostly  elevated  guideway  between 
the  Coliseum  BART  station  and  the  airport.  The  AGT  station  serving  the  Coliseum  BART  station 
would  be  located  on  the  west  side  of  San  Leandro  Street,  immediately  north  of  the  Hegenberger 
Expressway  overpass,  and  would  be  connected  to  the  existing  BART  train  platform  via  an  elevated 
walkway  and  escalators and  elevators  leading  to the  south  end  of  the  train  platform. At  the  airport, 
the AGT  station  would  be  located  in  a  portion  of  the  hourly  parking  lot  across  from  the  entrance  to 
Terminal  1.  Passengers  going  to  the  airport  would  take  an  escalator  or  elevator  from  the  AGT 
platform  to  ground  level  and  then  use  the  existing  signalized  crosswalks  to  cross  the  terminal 
roadway to access Terminal 1 and sidewalks leading to Terminal 2. A maintenance facility would be 
located on a site to the southwest of the Hegenberger Road/Airport Access Road intersection, which 
could be converted into an optional Doolittle station (13).   
Fare  payment  would  be  integrated  with  the  rest  of  the  BART  system,  meaning  that  passengers 
could  use  BART  fare  media  for  their  entire  trip  and  would  only  need  to  pay  once  during  their  trip 
to  or  from  the  airport.  Passengers  traveling  from  the  airport  would  purchase  their  BART  ticket 
upon  arrival  at  the  AGT  platform  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station  and  would  proceed  through 
faregates  leading  to  the  elevated  walkway  connecting  to  the  BART  train  platforms.  Although  the 
fare  has not yet  been  set,  recent  planning  documents  have  included  a  potential  fare  of  $6  (3, 5,  6).  If 
a  future  station  were  built  at  Doolittle,  passengers  traveling  between  the  airport  and  the  Doolittle 
station would not pay a fare; passengers traveling between other points in the BART system and the 
Doolittle station would pay the same fare as those traveling to the airport. 
Figure  3  shows  the  proposed  route.  Leaving  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  cablepropelled  vehicles 
would  travel  in  an  elevated  guideway  in  the  median  of  Hegenberger  Road  as  far  as  Pardee  Drive. 
The  elevated  guideway  would  then  continue  parallel  to  and  west  of  Airport  Access  Road,  passing 
through  the  optional  Doolittle  station.  The  guideway  would  then  fly  over Airport Access  Road  and 
Doolittle  Drive  before  coming  down  to  grade  along  the  south  side  of Airport  Drive.  Once  past  Ron 
Cowan  Parkway,  the  guideway  would  elevate  again  and  would  fly  over  the  terminal  loop  road  and 
cross above the daily parking lot before entering the airport station (13). Figure 4 shows the existing 
Coliseum  BART  station  and  Hegenberger  overpass.  Figure  5  provides  a  photosimulation  of  how 
the station might look with the AGT station and walkway from BART. 
AGT  trains  would  initially  consist  of  3  cars,  and  could  be  expanded  to  4  cars  at  a  later  date  if 
demand  warranted.  Each  car  would  have  one  door  on  each  side  and  the  train  interior  would  be 
open,  allowing  passengers  to  freely  move  throughout  the  train.  Based  on  illustrations  of  the 
proposed  vehicles,  a  4car  train  is  estimated  to  provide  32  seats  along  the  sides  of  the  train,  along 
with 4 seating positions at each end of the train. At a station, passengers would board and alight on 
the same side of the train, using all 3 or 4 doors.

    RAPID BUS

The  Rapid  Bus  option  is  designed  to  address  BART's  objectives  for  the  Oakland Airport  Connector 
at  a  substantially  lower  cost  than  AGT.  This  option  is  based  on  the  concept  of  streetrunning  bus 
rapid  transit  using  a  combination  of  semiexclusive  bus  lanes  and  bus  signal  priority  to  provide 
faster, more reliable service than the current AirBART service. Similar types of service are currently 
provided  in  Las  Vegas,  Phoenix,  and  Honolulu  (9).  AC  Transit's  San  Pablo  Avenue  72R  Rapid  line 
and  VTA's  522  Rapid  line  from  San  Jose  to  Palo Alto  are  now  using  some  of  these  features,  such  as 
special  queue  jump  lanes  at  busy  intersections,  but  lack  the  bus  lane  component  that  is  being 
proposed  in  this  analysis.  Service  quality  would  be  improved  over  AirBART  in  a  number  of 
respects--running way, stations, fare integration, and vehicle--as described below.

Running Way
Portions  of  the  route  operating  on  Hegenberger  Road  that  could  experience  traffic  congestion 
would be operated in curbside bus lanes. General vehicle traffic would be allowed into or across the 
bus  lane  to  make  a  right  turn  at  the  next  driveway  or  intersection,  but  buses  would  otherwise  be 
free  to  travel  in  a  lane  unobstructed  by  other  vehicles.  At  intersections  at  the  end  of  a  bus  lane, 
buses would receive a green signal prior to other through vehicles, thus allowing buses to jump the 
queue  and  proceed  along  their  route  (and  change  lanes,  if  necessary)  ahead  of  other  traffic.  Signal 
priority  at  traffic  signals  would  hold  a  green  signal  a  few  seconds  longer,  if  needed,  to  allow  a 
Rapid  Bus  to  make  it  through  the  intersection,  or  would  return  the  signal  to  green  a  few  seconds 
earlier, if a bus was stopped at the intersection. 
The  assumed  route  is  shown  in  Figure  6.  Similar  to  the  "Quality  Bus"  alternative  in  the  2002  Final 
EIR/EIS  for  the  Oakland  Airport  Connector,  buses  would  stop  in  a  new  bus  lane  between  San 
Leandro  Street  and  the  BART  tracks  to  the  south  of  the  existing  BART  station.  A  special  traffic 
signal  phase  would  be  provided  at  the  bus  lane  exit  that  would  allow  buses  to  cross  San  Leandro 
Street and access the onramp to Hegenberger Expressway. Once on Hegenberger, buses would  use 
a  curbside  exclusive  bus  lane  as  far  as  South  Coliseum  Drive,  and  would  then  merge  left  one  lane 
prior to the I880 interchange. After the point where a general traffic lane is added on the left side of 
Hegenberger Road, a bus lane would be developed in the second lane from the right, with the right 
lane  being  reserved  for  traffic  bound  for  Edgewater  Drive.  The  bus  lane  would  continue  across 
Edgewater  Drive,  at  which  point  rightturning  traffic  would  be  allowed  to  use  the  lane.  The  lane 
would  continue  to  Doolittle  Drive,  where  a  queue  jump  phase  would  be provided,  when necessary, 
to give buses a head start across the intersection. Buses would continue in general traffic on Airport 
Drive to the airport terminal, where they would serve a stop on the third curb between Terminals 1 
and 2. 
Returning from the airport, buses would operate in general traffic on Airport Drive, and would exit 
onto  Airport  Access  Road.  They  would  then  operate  in  a  semiexclusive  bus  lane  (right  turns 
allowed) on Airport Access Road to Hegenberger Road, and continuing in a semiexclusive bus lane 
on  Hegenberger  to  Edgewater  Drive. At  Edgewater  Drive,  a  queue  jump  phase  would  be  provided, 
when  necessary,  to  give  buses  a  head  start  across  the  intersection.  The  semiexclusive  bus  lane 
would  resume  past  the  I880  interchange  in  the  right  lane  and  would  continue  to  the  exit  to  San 
Leandro  Street.  At  the  traffic  signal  at  San  Leandro  Street,  buses  would  turn  into  a  bus  lane  and 
proceed to the bus stop. 
The  bus  lanes  could  be  developed  within  the  existing  street  rightofway  and  no  driveway  or 
median closures would be required. Conceptual street crosssections are provided in Appendix B.

Stations
The  station  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station  would  be  constructed  in  the  space  beneath,  and 
immediately  adjacent  to  the  BART  tracks  south  of  the  existing  BART  train  platform.  Passengers 
arriving  on  BART  trains  would  walk  to  the  south  end  of  the  train  platform,  where  they  would  take 
an  escalator,  stair,  or  elevator  down  to  the  ground  level  into  a  waiting  area  constructed  underneath 
the  southbound  BART  tracks.  The  waiting  area  would  be  enclosed  and  climatecontrolled.  When  a 
bus  was  ready  to  load  passengers,  platform  screen  doors  would  open  to  allow  access  to  the  bus 
doors.  A  minimal  gap  would  exist  between  the  platform  and  the  bus  (as  in  the  BRT  systems  in 
Eugene,  Cleveland,  and Las  Vegas), which  could  be  bridged  if  necessary by  a  ramp  extending  from 
the  bus.  Passengers  would  remain  within  the  BART  farepaid  area  at  all  times.  Passengers  arriving 
at  the  station  by  Rapid  Bus  would  be  dropped  off  at  a  separate  enclosed  unloading  area  closer  to 
75th  Avenue,  which  would  lead  to  a  choice  of  escalator,  stair,  or  elevator  up  to  the  BART  train 
platform  level.  A  layover  position  for  buses  would  be  provided  between  the  departure  and  arrival 
platforms. Figure 7 and Figure 9 show the existing Coliseum BART station at San Leandro. Figure 8 
and  Figure  10  provide  examples  of  how  the  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT  stations  would  be  integrated 
into the existing rightofway. 
The  station  at  the  airport  would  be  constructed  on  the  third  curb  of  the  terminal  roadway  between 
Terminals  1  and  2,  with  the  sidewalk  widened  into  the  first  lane  of  the  threelane  bus  roadway  to 
provide  additional  waiting  area  for  passengers.  As  was  the  case  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station, 
separate  enclosed  loading  and  unloading  positions  would  be  provided,  and  access  to  and  from 
these  areas  would  be  controlled  by  faregates  and  platform  screen  doors.  Ticket  vending  and 
addfare machines would also be provided, along with an optional station agent booth. 
The  Oakland  Airport  Master  Plan  identifies  a  potential  future  Terminal  3,  which  would  be  located 
west  of  Terminal  1  and  become  the  first  terminal  reached  upon  entering  the  terminal  area.  An 
optional  station  serving  a  future  Terminal  3  could  be  constructed  near  the  terminal  entrance  if 
needed.  Optional  intermediate  stations  could  also  be  provided  along  Hegenberger  Road  at  Pardee 
Drive  and  Edgewater  Drive,  by  extending  the  sidewalk  into  the  parking  lane.  These  stations  would 
provide  equipment  for  vending  and  processing  BART  tickets  and  smart  cards,  but  would  not 
necessarily  have  to  be  fully  enclosed,  as  fare  control  also  occurs  when  passengers  exit  the  BART 
system.  If  a  farepaid  area  was  desired,  different  equipment  than  a  standard  BART  faregate  might 
need to be used, due to sidewalk space limitations.

Fare Integration
Passengers  would  use  standard  BART  fare  media  and  would  process  their  ticket  or  smart  card  at 
the  airport  (or  intermediate  station,  if  incorporated  into  the  route).  Because  passengers  would 
remain  in  the  farepaid  area  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  the  transfer  would  occur  similarly  to 
transfers between routes elsewhere in the BART system.

Vehicles
The  assumed  vehicle  is  the  same  as  that  assumed  for  the  FEIR/FEIS  Quality  Bus  option,  namely  a 
60foot  articulated  bus  equipped  with  luggage  racks  and  47  seats.  The  vehicle  would  have  three 
doors on the right side of the bus. Figure 11 shows the type of special vehicle that is used for Rapid 
Bus or BRT service.

FULL BRT

The  Full  BRT  option  is  designed  to  provide  a  greater  degree  of  exclusive  rightofway  (and  thus 
better  speeds  and  reliability)  than  the  Rapid  Bus  option,  while  keeping  overall  costs  substantially 
below  that  of  AGT.  This  alternative  provides  bus  rapid  transit  running  in  the  street  median  to 
provide  greater  insulation  from  traffic  effects,  plus  a  gradeseparated  section  at  the  south  entrance 
to  the  Coliseum.  Similar  types  of  service  are  currently  operated  in  Cleveland  and  Eugene.  As  was 
the case with Rapid Bus, service quality would be improved in a number of respects--running way, 
stations, fare integration, and vehicle. 

Running Way
Buses  would  operate  in  the  median  of  Hegenberger  Road  for  most  of  its  length  between  BART  and 
the  airport.  Turns  across  the  median  would  only  be  allowed  at  traffic  signals,  meaning  that  some 
left  turns  in  the  corridor  would  be  converted  into  a  right  turn  and  a  Uturn  (or  vice  versa). A  semi
exclusive (right turns allowed) curbside bus lane would be provided along Airport Access Road for 
buses  traveling  from  the  airport  to  BART.  Between  I880  and  Baldwin  Street,  four  lanes  for  buses 
and  through  Hegenberger  traffic  would  be  elevated,  flying  over  the  Hegenberger  Road/South 
Coliseum  Way  intersection  to  avoid  potential  traffic  delays,  particularly  before  and  after  Coliseum 
events.  Traffic  signal  preemption  for  buses  would  be  provided  at  the  traffic  signal  serving  a 
driveway northeast of Baldwin Street, to allow buses to enter and exit the median bus lanes without 
delay. Traffic signal priority would be provided at other signalized intersections. The assumed route 
is shown in Figure 12.

The  bus  lanes  could  be  developed  within  the  existing  street  rightofway,  although  the  landscaping 
in  Hegenberger  Road  between  Edgewater  Drive  and  Doolittle  Drive  would  need  to  be  replaced  as 
part  of  the  construction  of  the  median  bus  lanes.  Conceptual  street  crosssections  are  provided  in 
Appendix B. 

Stations
Stations  at  BART  and  the  airport  would  be  the  same  as  described  for  the  Rapid  Bus  option, 
including  the  option  to  provide  a  station  at  a  future  Terminal  3.  Figure  13  and  demonstrates  how  a 
BRT  station  is  connected  to  a  station  using  a  walkway.  Figure  14  provides  a  view  of  the  level 
boarding  feature.  The  vehicle  will  line  up  with  the  glass  doors  at  the  station,  providing  fast  easy

Optional  intermediate  stations  could  also  be  provided  along  Hegenberger  Road  at  Pardee  Drive 
and  Edgewater  Drive  in  the  median  of  Hegenberger  Road,  accessed  from  the  crosswalks  at  the 
adjacent  intersections.  These  stations  would  provide  equipment  for  vending  and  processing  BART 
tickets  and  smart  cards,  but  would  not  necessarily  have  to  be  fully  enclosed,  as  fare  control  also 
occurs  when  passengers  exit  the  BART  system.  If  a  farepaid  area  was  desired,  different  equipment 
than  a  standard  BART  faregate  might  need  to  be  used,  due  to  space  limitations.  A  rendering  of  an 
intermediate station under the Full BRT option is shown in Figure 15.

Passengers  would  use  standard  BART  fare  media  and  would  process  their  ticket  or  smart  card  at 
the  airport  (or  intermediate  station,  if  incorporated  into  the  route).  Because  passengers  would 
remain  in  the  farepaid  area  at  the  Coliseum  BART  station,  the  transfer  would  occur  similarly  to 
transfers  between  rail  lines  elsewhere  in  the  BART  system.  Different  fares  could  be  charged  to 
different  stations  along  the  route,  if  desired  (for  example,  a  premium  fare  for  trips  to  the  airport, 
similar to the premium fare that BART charges to San Francisco International Airport).

Analysis of the Options

INTRODUCTION

This  section  presents  the  methodology  and  calculation  used  to  assess  the  operating  characteristics 
and  costs  for  each  of  the  options  under  base  conditions  (i.e.,  assuming  the  current  AirBART  fare 
and  without  any  optional  stations).  After  base  conditions  have  been  analyzed,  further  analysis  is 
presented of the implications of different fare levels and the addition of optional stations. 


WALK DISTANCES

Walk  distances  are  based  on  the  horizontal  path  used  by  passengers,  as  measured  using  Google 
Earth,  not  including  the  length  of  any  escalators  used  (the  time  spent  on  escalators  is  accounted  for 
separately in a subsequent step). The height of vertical circulation (escalator/stair/elevator) elements 
at  the  Coliseum  BART  station  is  estimated  from  FEIR/FEIS  information  (11),  the  height  of  the AGT 
station  at  Coliseum  BART  relative  to  the  train  platform  comes  from  the  Flatiron/Parsons/ 
Doppelmayr  Executive  Summary  (13),  and  the  height  of  the AGT  station  at  the  airport  is  estimated 
from  an  illustration  in  the  Flatiron/Parsons/Doppelmayr  Executive  Summary  (13).  Table  1 
summarizes the walk distances for each option.

Table  1  shows  that  AGT  provides  the  shortest  walk  distance  to  Terminal  1,  but  the  longest  walk 
distance to Terminal 2, a future Terminal 3, and to the Coliseum BART station. 


IN-VEHICLE TIME

Base  oneway  invehicle  time  (prior  to  accounting  for  speed  improvements  due  to  transit  priority 
measures) was determined as follows: 
       ·    AirBART:  Based  on  a  minimum  7.3mile  round  trip,  and  the  average  speed  of  16.8  mph 
            from the FEIR/FEIS (11). 
       ·    Rapid Bus and Full BRT: Based on a 6.8mile round trip and the AirBART average speed. 
       ·    AGT: Based on the Flatiron/Parsons/Doppelmayr Executive Summary (13).

Analysis of the Options


Travel  time  savings  due  to  bus  lanes  (both  curbside  and  median)  were  assumed  to  be  0.5  minutes 
per mile of bus lane, based on information in the BRT Practioner's Handbook (10). Travel time savings 
due  to  bus  signal  priority  was  estimated  at  5%,  which  is  the  low  end  of  the  range  given  in  the  BRT 
Practioner's  Handbook  (10),  as  the  portion  of  the  route  on  airport  property  has  no  traffic  signals. 
Travel  time  savings  for  Full  BRT  resulting  from  the  flyover  were  determined  from  the  traffic 
analysis presented in Appendix A. Table 2 presents the travel time results for the year 2013.

Table  2  shows  that  AGT  provides  the  fastest  invehicle  time  in  2013,  about  1.4  minutes  faster  than 
Full BRT and about 2.4 minutes faster than Rapid Bus. 
Oneway  invehicle  time  in  2030  was  estimated  for  the  bus  options  by  adding  the  change  in  delay 
for  bus  movements  at  key  signalized  intersections  (estimated  from  the  traffic  analysis  in Appendix 
A)  to  the  2013  invehicle  time.  AGT  travel  time  remains  the  same,  as  it  has  no  traffic  signal 
interference to deal with. Table 3 presents the travel time results for the year 2030.

Table  3  shows  that  AGT  also  provides  the  fastest  invehicle  time  in  2030,  about  1.9  minutes  faster 
than  Full  BRT  and  about  4.0  minutes  faster  than  Rapid  Bus.  Most  of  the  increase  in  travel  time 
occurs  due  to  congestion  at  the  South  Coliseum  Way/Hegenberger  Road  intersection,  but  the 
flyover  included  as  part  of  the  Full  BRT  option  allows  buses  (and  through  traffic)  to  avoid  that 
delay.  


TRANSIT TRAVEL TIME

Transit  travel  time  reflects  the  average  amount  of  time  persons  would  spend  on  the  BART  system 
from the time they entered a BART station to the time they arrived at an airport terminal. This time 
includes the following:

         airport  to  a  terminal  entrance  (including  time  on  escalators  and  an  assumed  average  30
         second  delay  at  the  crosswalks  across  the  terminal  roadway,  estimated  from  field 
         measurements). 

Walk time was estimated using a walking speed of 4 feet per second, escalator speed of 100 feet per 
minute,  walk  distances  from  a  previous  step,  and  typical  escalator  dimensions.  Boarding  time  is 
incorporated  into  the  average  wait  time  for  the  next  Connector  departure,  as  it  is  assumed  the  next 
vehicle  will  arrive  at  a  station  shortly  after  the  previous  one  departs.  Deboarding  time  assumes  2 
seconds per person per door on AGT, 5 seconds per person per door on buses (assuming congestion 
around  the  bus  luggage  racks),  2  doors  per  vehicle  for  AirBART,  3  doors  per  vehicle  for  the  other 
options, and 25 persons per vehicle.

Full  BRT  is  faster  than  either  of  these  by  1.0  minute.  AGT's  superior  invehicle  travel  time  and 
deboarding  time  is  offset  by  the  longer  walking  distances  required  at  both  ends  of  the  AGT  trip, 
particularly  to  Terminal  2.  In  2030,  Full  BRT  is  faster  than AGT  by  0.3  minutes,  while AGT  is  faster 
than Rapid Bus by 1.6 minutes.

Analysis of the Options


RELIABILITY

From  a  passenger's  pointofview,  particularly  when  traveling  to  the  airport,  reliability  can  be 
measured  in  terms  of  the  extra  time  passengers  should  allow  to  be  reasonably  certain  of  arriving  at 
their  destination  by  their  desired  time  (e.g.,  final  checkin  time).  The  more  reliable  the  service,  the 
less  time  passengers  need  to  budget  for  unscheduled  events.  Buffer  time  measures  the  extra  time  a 
person  should  budget  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  destination  by  the  desired  time  95%  of  the  time.  In  an 
airport  context,  the  connector  buffer  time  is  only  a  portion  of  the  total  buffer  time  needed  for  the 
trip,  as  passengers  would  also  need  to  budget  extra  time  for  their  initial  BART  ride  and  to  account 
for unexpectedly long lines at checkin counters and/or security. 
The  FEIR/FEIS  (11)  identifies  four  sources  of  unreliability  in  the  existing  AirBART  service:  traffic 
congestion  at  peak  travel  times  during  the  day  ("rush  hour");  traffic  congestion  during  peak  travel 
periods  at  the  airport  (e.g.  holidays);  traffic  congestion  due  to  special  events  at  the  Coliseum;  and 
variable travel times due to traffic signal delays, differences in passenger loads from trip to trip, etc. 
The  Oakland  Airport  Master  Plan  (14)  states  that  "the  current  roadway  system,  which  is  under 
construction  in  the  loop  area  until  2008,  is  expected  to  accommodate  passenger  demand  increases 
anticipated  due  to  the  expansion  and  renovation  of  Terminal  2."  The  Master  Plan  goes  on  to 
identify  additional  access  and  roadway  improvements  that  could  be  considered  if  further  airport 
expansion  occurred;  these  improvements  would  be  expected  to  maintain  good  traffic  operations 
within the airport property if the airport were to expand. Therefore, reliability  issues due to airport 
peak travel have been removed as an issue, and only the other three now need to be considered. 
Other  potential  sources  of  delay  that  impact  reliability  are  emergency  situations  and  mechanical 
breakdowns.  Bus  systems  can  be  flexible,  adding  another  vehicle,  driving  around  a  stalled  vehicle, 
or  even  selecting  an  alternate  route.  Unlike  bus  systems,  emergency  situations  and  mechanical 
breakdowns  on  the AGT  system  remove  half  or  even  the  entire  system  from  service  rather  than  the 
just  the  affected  vehicle.  Because  these  situations  are  very  infrequent,  they  have  not  been  included 
in this analysis. 
Buffer time was estimated for each option as follows: 
    ·    AirBART: According  to  the  FEIR/FEIS  (11),  normal AirBART  travel  times  range  from  15­30 
         minutes.  We  therefore  assume  a  15minute  buffer  time  for  AirBART  (i.e.,  15  minutes  extra 
         time  above  the  15minute  scheduled  time).  It  is  not  known  whether  the  30minute  trips 
         occurred  during  special  events  or  not,  and  the  FEIR/FEIS  data  were  developed  prior  to  the 
         opening  of  the  improved  98th  Avenue  connection  to  the  airport;  therefore,  the  15minute 
         buffer  time  estimate  is  considered  to  be  conservative.  During  Coliseum  special  events, 
         AirBART  could  be  diverted  via  98th  Avenue,  which  adds  0.9  miles  to  the  trip,  or  about  3 
         minutes  of  travel  time  at  the  AirBART  speed  of  16.8  mph  given  in  the  FEIR/FEIS.  In  the 
         future,  AirBART  would  be  subject  to  greater  travel  time  variability  as  traffic  congestion 
         increased. 
    ·    Rapid  Bus:  Rapid  Bus  would  operate  in  curbside  bus  lanes  on  Hegenberger  Road  and 
         would  be  provided  with  traffic  signal  priority  at  signalized  intersections. According  to  data 
         in  the  BRT  Practitioner's  Guide  (10),  curbside  bus  lanes  reduce  travel  time  variability  by  an 
         average  of  20%,  while  bus  signal  priority  reduces  travel  time  variability  by  about  35%.

Oakland Airport Connector Options Analysis                                                               August 2010
Analysis of the Options


         Applying  these  travel  time  variability  reductions  to  the AirBART  buffer  time,  it  is  estimated 
         that  the  buffer  time  for  Rapid  Bus  would  be  8  minutes.  During  Coliseum  special  events, 
         Rapid  Bus  could  be  diverted  via  98th  Avenue,  which  adds  0.9  miles  to  the  trip,  or  about  3 
         minutes  of  travel  time  at  the  current  scheduled  AirBART  speed  of  16.8  mph.  If  additional 
         stops  were  provided  on  Hegenberger  Road,  Rapid  Bus  would  not  be  able  to  divert  via  98th 
         Avenue and other means would be required to address unreliability due to Coliseum traffic. 
         The  FEIR/FEIS  identifies  traffic  control  measures  such  as  those  used  to  facilitate  bus  and 
         light  rail  travel  to  and  from  Pacific  Bell  (now AT&T)  Park  in  San  Francisco  as  feasible  ways 
         to ensure that buses are given priority (11). Given the presence of a bus lane that buses could 
         use  to  jump  the  queue  as  right  turns  into  the  Coliseum  were  being  served,  the  additional 
         delay  getting  through  the  Hegenberger  Road/South  Coliseum  Way  intersection  would  not 
         be  expected  to  be  more  than  3  minutes,  and  could  be  less,  depending  on  the  form  of  traffic 
         control  used.  In  the  future,  the  bus  lanes  would  help  protect  Rapid  Bus  from  increased 
         travel  time  variability,  as  buses  would  be  able  to  bypass  congestion  in  the  general  traffic 
         lanes. 
    ·    Full  BRT:  Full  BRT  would  operate  in  median  bus  lanes  on  Hegenberger  Road,  would  be 
         provided  with  traffic  signal  priority  at  signalized  intersections,  and  would  have  a  flyover  at 
         South Coliseum Way that would avoid the traffic signal (and any special event traffic) at the 
         intersection. According  to  data  in  the  BRT  Practitioner's  Guide  (10),  median  bus  lanes  reduce 
         travel  time  variability  by  an  average  of  57%,  while  bus  signal  priority  reduces  travel  time 
         variability  by  about  35%.  Applying  these  travel  time  variability  reductions  to  the  AirBART 
         buffer time, it is estimated that the buffer time for Full BRT would be 4 minutes. The flyover 
         would  allow  buses  to  avoid  any  special  event  traffic  (assuming  normal  traffic  signal 
         operation  at  the  Hegenberger  Road/I880  Southbound  Offramp  intersection);  thus,  the 
         special  event  buffer  time  for  Full  BRT  would  be  expected  to  be  0  minutes.  In  the  future,  the 
         bus  lanes  would  help  protect  Full  BRT  from  increased  traffic  congestion,  as  buses  would  be 
         able to bypass the congestion. 
    ·    AGT: AGT  vehicles  would  operate  in  a  complete  gradeseparated  guideway  and  would  not 
         experience  any  traffic  interference.  According  to  data  from  the  Flatiron/Parsons/ 
         Doppelmayr  Executive  Summary,  similar  systems  achieve  99%+  system  reliability  in  terms 
         of  time  in  operation.  Therefore,  the  buffer  time  for AGT  is  assumed  to  be  0  minutes  in  both 
         the opening year and the longterm future.  

Table 5 summarizes these results.

Table 5 shows that under the AGT option, passengers would not need to budget any extra time due 
to  unreliability.  Passengers  should  budget  4  extra  minutes  to  make  sure  of  arriving  at  their 
destination  on  time  95%  of  the  time  with  Full  BRT,  and  up  to  11  extra  minutes  with  Rapid  Bus.

Analysis of the Options


Coming  to  the  airport  under  any  option,  passengers  would  also  want  to  budget  extra  time  for  the 
possibility  of  long  checkin  and  security  lines  (the  airport  recommends  arriving  a  minimum  of  90 
minutes  prior  to  departure  and  many  airlines  recommend  2  hours).  When  coming  to  the  airport, 
budgeting  extra  time  essentially  means  catching  the  next  earlier  BART  train  (which  depending  on 
the  origin  BART  station  and  time  of  day,  could  leave  15­20  minutes  earlier),  and  passengers  would 
need  to  consider  whether  the  small  possibility  of  being,  for  example,  4  minutes  late  would  be 
sufficient  to  leave  15  minutes  earlier,  particularly  given  time  allowances  for  delays  at  the  airport. 
Traveling  from  the  airport,  randomness  in  flight  arrival  times  in  relation  to  the  schedule,  baggage 
delivery  times,  and  Connector  arrival  times  at  BART  relative  to  the  arrival  of  a  BART  train  to  one's 
destination would make Connector travel time variability relatively unimportant. 


RIDERSHIP

Ridership in the year of opening (2013) was forecast based on the following factors: 
    ·    Base  AirBART  ridership  for  2010,  from  the  latest  BART  ridership  forecast  for  the  Oakland 
         Airport Connector (3); 
    ·    Airport  passenger  growth  to  2013  (from  8.8  to  9.6  million  annual  passengers),  assuming 
         Connector ridership grows proportionately to airport passenger volume; 
    ·    Ridership growth due to frequency improvements relative to AirBART;  
    ·    Ridership  growth  due  to  travel  time  improvements  relative  to  AirBART,  based  on  the 
         complete BART trip (including time on regular BART trains); and 
    ·    Ridership growth due to rapid transit image. 
Elasticity  factors  given  in  the  BRT  Practitioner's  Guide  (10)  and  the  Traveler  Response  to  Transportation 
System  Changes  series  of  reports  (15)  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  change  in  ridership  due  to  travel 
time  and  frequency  improvements.  For  travel  time,  a  midpoint  arc  elasticity  of  0.4  was  assumed 
(roughly  stated,  for  every  1%  reduction  in  travel  time,  ridership  increases  by  0.4%). For  ridership,  a 
midpoint  arc  elasticity  of  +0.2  for  frequency  was  assumed,  which  roughly  means  for  every  1% 
increase  in  frequency,  ridership  increases  0.2%.  Because  the  existing  AirBART  service  is  already 
relatively frequent, a value toward the low end of the range of possible values was used. 
Certain transit modes will attract riders that are not attracted to local bus service. This phenomenon 
has  long  been  known  for  rail  modes,  and  is  often  incorporated  into  longrange  traffic  forecasting 
models.  A  similar  phenomenon  has  been  documented  for  BRT,  with  fullfeatured  BRT  routes 
showing  up  to  a  25%  increase  in  ridership  beyond  what  would  be  expected  from  frequency  and 
travel  time  improvements  (10).  The  BRT  Practitioner's  Guide  (10)  provides  a  method  for  estimating 
ridership  growth  due  to  the  image  of  rapid  transit,  based  on  the  number  of  BRT  system  features 
(e.g.,  type  of  running  way,  fare  collection  method,  etc.)  that  are  provided.  This  ridership  growth  is 
due  to  perceived  comfort  and  reliability,  branding,  special  vehicles,  upgraded  stations,  ease  of 
transfers, and other factors that generate additional ridership beyond that of a local bus with similar 
frequency  and  travel  time  characteristics.  For  Rapid  Bus,  14%  growth  was  used,  while  22%  growth 
was used for Full BRT. For AGT, 25% growth was assumed for this factor, based on a comparison of 
BART's  latest  nearterm  and  longterm  low  forecasts  (3)  to  ridership  growth  due  to  frequency  and 
travel time improvements.

Analysis of the Options


Estimated  ridership  for  2013,  therefore,  is  the  sum  of  anticipated  AirBART  ridership  in  2013 
(reflecting  airport  passenger  growth)  and  the  sum  of  the  other  factors  listed  above.  Ridership 
forecasts  for  2030  are  generated  by  a  similar  process,  using  BART's  low  (15.9  million  annual 
passengers)  and  high  (20.6  million  annual  passengers)  airport  passenger  forecasts,  and  reflecting 
any  changes  in  travel  time  from  2013  to  2030.  Note  that  in  order  to  provide  an  applestoapples 
comparison of the alternatives, a $3 fare is assumed for all modes.  
Table  6  through  Table  8  provide  ridership  forecasts  for  2013,  2030  (low  forecast),  and  2030  (high 
forecast)  respectively.  For  ease  of  comparison,  the  full  ridership  effect  of  all  of  the  factors  listed 
above  is  assumed  to  take  place  immediately;  in  actuality,  the  effect  would  occur  over  time  (BART's 
latest forecasts (3) assume 3 years).

Table 6­Table 8 show that the Full BRT and AGT would generate approximately the same ridership 
in  all  analysis  years,  with  ridership  levels  about  7%  higher  than  the  Rapid  Bus  option  and  about 
48% higher than the AirBART option. 
The  above  ridership  estimates  are  based  on  a  $3  fare  for  each  alternative.  Although  the  AGT  fare 
has  not  yet  been  set,  recent  planning  documents  have  included  a  potential  fare  of  $6  (3,  4,  6).  This 
analysis  uses  a  fare  elasticity  of  0.2  consistent  with  the  Traveler  Response  to  Transportation  System 
Changes series of reports (15) and BART­Oakland Airport Connector Patronage Refinement Final Report, 
April  24,  2007  (2).  A  fare  elasticity  of 0.2  indicates  an  approximate  0.2  percent  decrease  in  transit 
ridership  in  response  to  each  1  percent  fare  increase.  Adjusting  for  the  loss  of  ridership  due  to  the 
higher  fare,  2013  ridership  would  be  2,685,  and  2030  ridership  would  be  between  4,465  (low 
estimate) to 5,785 (high estimate).  


DIRECTIONAL HOURLY CAPACITY AND DEMAND

Providing  sufficient  capacity  ensures  that  passengers  can  board  the  first  vehicle  that  arrives  (thus 
avoiding  any  delays  and  potential  ridership  loss  due  to  overcrowding).  Capacity  can  be  measured 
in  terms  of  persons  per  hour  (seated  and  standing)  or  seats  per  hour.  Buses  are  designed  to  have  most 
persons  seated,  while  AGT  vehicles  provide  a  relatively  small  number  of  seats  compared  to  their 
overall person capacity, and most people stand when an AGT vehicle is fully loaded. Both measures 
are evaluated here. 
For  consistency  with  previous  planning  efforts,  theoretical  capacities  are  used--that  is,  the  number 
of seats or passenger spaces per vehicle is multiplied by the number of departures per direction per 
hour.  Theoretical  capacities  therefore  assume  that  every  seat/space  is  occupied  on  every  trip.  Given 
variations  in  passenger  demands  from  one  departure  to  the  next  (particularly  at  the  Coliseum 
station,  where  passengers  will  arrive  by  the  trainload  rather  than  at  random),  practical  capacities 
would  be  approximately  25%  less.  Practical  capacities  reflect  the  typical  number  of  people  that  can 
be  accommodated  per  hour  without  some  passengers  having  to  wait  for  the  next  Connector 
departure due to overcrowding of an individual vehicle.

Analysis of the Options


Service  frequencies  for  AirBART  are  based  on  current  operation:  10minute  headways  correspond 
to  6  departures  per  hour.  The  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT  options  use  the  same  assumption  as  the 
Quality  Bus  option  in  the  FEIR/FEIS  (11):  4minute  headways,  corresponding  to  15  departures  per 
hour.  Service  frequencies  for  AGT  are  taken  from  the  Flatiron/Parsons/Doppelmayr  Executive 
Summary  (13):  275second  headways,  corresponding  to  13  departures  per  hour.  Seats  and 
passenger spaces per vehicle are as described in Section 3 of this report. 
Peak  hour  demand  is  based  on  data  provided  by  the  Port  of  Oakland,  which  shows  that  12.1%  of 
Friday daily passenger trips occurred during the busiest hour of the day during May and June 2010. 
Therefore, peak directional demand is calculated as (daily ridership) * (12.1%) * (50%), with the 50% 
factor  representing  an  assumed  50/50  split  between  passengers  going  to  and  from  the  airport 
between 5 and 6 pm on a Friday. 
Table 9 summarizes the capacity and demand analysis.

Table  9  shows  that  all  of  the  nonAirBART  options  provide  sufficient  capacity  to  meet  the  high 
demand forecasts through 2030, with the AGT option providing far more total person capacity than 
is required. The Rapid Bus and Full BRT options offer a higher seated capacity than AGT, though. 

According to the Oakland Airport Master Plan (14), the airport will reach its capacity at or before 30 
million  annual  passengers,  or  approximately  50%  higher  passenger  volumes  than  used  for  the  2030 
high  forecast.  The  Master  Plan  indicates  that  expanding  capacity  would  require  adding  a  new 
runway,  which  the  airport  does  not  plan  to  do.  All  of  the  nonAirBART  options  would,  therefore, 
accommodate  the  airport's  maximum  passenger  levels,  assuming  no  changes  in  mode  split  due  to 
external  factors  (e.g.,  gasoline  or  parking  prices).  When  considering  practical  capacities  (25%  lower 
than  shown  in  Table  9),  all  of  the  nonAirBART  options  could  still  accommodate  demand  without 
shortterm overcrowding occurring during typical Friday peak hours. 

If  additional  capacity  was  required,  additional  Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT  buses  could  be  operated. 
The longest traffic signal cycle length in the corridor sets a practical limit on the minimum headway 
that  could  be  operated  without  bus  bunching  occurring  routinely,  but  decreasing  the  headway  to  3 
minutes, for example, would increase Rapid Bus and Full BRT capacity by 33%.

Analysis of the Options


VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS

The  number  of  vehicles  required  to  operate  service  at  a  given  headway  depends  on  the  cycle  time, 
the  time  required  to  make  a  complete  round  trip,  including  allowances  for  late  arrivals  and  driver 
break time. Cycle time was calculated as the sum of: 
       ·   Average dwell time (time for passenger boarding and deboarding, estimated using the same 
           process as in the previous step); 
       ·   Roundtrip running time (twice the average invehicle time from previous steps); and 
       ·   Recovery  time  (driver  break  time  and  allowance  for  late  arrivals,  assumed  to  be  a  minimum 
           of  10%  of  the  combined  dwell  and  invehicle  time,  and  rounded  up  to  provide  an  integer 
           number of vehicles in service). 
Dividing  the  cycle  time  by  the  peak  headway  gives  the  maximum  number  of  vehicles  required  in 
service.  For  the  bus  options,  spare  bus  requirements  were  assumed  to  be  20%  of  the  number  of 
vehicles  required  in  maximum  service,  rounded  up.  Table  10  summarizes  the  vehicle  requirements 
for 2013; Table 11 summarizes the vehicle requirements for 2030.

Analysis of the Options


OPERATING COSTS

Operating  costs  (including  maintenance,  insurance,  fuel/electricity,  and  debt  service  costs)  were 
estimated as follows: 
       ·     AirBART: AirBART  service  is  contracted  out  through  the  Port  of  Oakland.  Based  on  Port  of 
             Oakland  data  for  2007­2009,  AirBART  annual  operating  costs  averaged  $2.4  million  per 
             year. Assuming  a  3%  cost  increase  per  year,  2013  annual  costs  would  be  approximately  $2.7 
             million.  
       ·     Rapid  Bus  and  Full  BRT:  Estimates  were  prepared  assuming  service  was  contracted  to  a 
             private  operator,  consistent  with  existing  AirBART  service  and  the  proposed  AGT  service. 
             Contracted  costs  were  based  on  four  Bay  Area  operators  with  contracted  service  (Central 
             Contra  Costa,  Western Contra  Costa,  Eastern  Contra  Costa,  and  Livermore/Amador  Valley), 
             which  averaged  $90  per  revenue  hour  in  2008,  or  $104  per  revenue  hour  when  inflated  to 
             2013  values.  All  capital  improvements  are  assumed  to  be  built  without  incurring  debt  (see 
             section on Capital Costs). The annual costs for years 2013 and 2030 are shown in Table 12.  
             Peak  service  was  assumed  to  be  operated  between  7  a.m.  and  10  p.m.  every  day,  with 
             reduced headways (every 7.5 minutes) for an additional 5.25 hours per day. 
       ·     AGT:  As  a  Design/Build/Operate/Maintain  project,  AGT  service  would  be  contracted  out. 
             Costs of $4.9 million were taken from the Flatiron/Parsons/Doppelmayr Executive Summary 
             (13).  In  addition,  BART  will  incur  annual  costs  of  $1.65  million  for  electricity,  insurance  and 
             finance  fees,  and  an  average  of  $6.37  million  annually  for  debt  service1  (6).  Total  estimated 
             annual BART operating costs are shown in Table 12. 

Reserves for vehicle and other capital costs are not included  in operating costs but are addressed in 
the following section on Capital Costs. Table 12 summarizes operating costs for each option. 

                                 Table 12                Annual Operating Costs (millions of 2013 dollars)
                                                                   AirBART        Rapid Bus         Full BRT   AGT

    Year 2013                                                         2.7             4.8              4.8     12.9

    Year 2030                                                         2.7             5.5              4.8     12.9


Table  12  shows  that  the  AGT  option  would  have  significantly  higher  annual  operating  costs, 
primarily due to debt service on construction of the system. Contracted Rapid Bus would also have 
similar  annual  operating  costs  initially,  but  these  costs  would  increase  by  14%  by  2030  (in  constant 
dollars),  because  an  extra  bus  will  eventually  need  to  be  added  to  the  route  due  to  increased 
intersection  delays.   Not  included  for  any  of  the  options  is  the  potential  cost  of  a  station  agent  to 
monitor the station and address customer questions with fare payment, routes, etc. Assuming three 
shifts, providing a station agent would cost approximately $400,000 per year in 2013 dollars.

Analysis of the Options


CAPITAL COSTS

Initial capital costs were estimated as follows and are summarized in Table 13: 
    ·    AirBART:  No  changes  would  be  made  to  the  existing  service;  therefore,  no  capital  costs 
         were assumed. 
    ·    Rapid Bus and Full BRT: Costs are assigned to the following categories: vehicles, guideway 
         and  intelligent  transportation  systems  (e.g.,  traffic  signal  priority),  stations,  and  intersection 
         mitigation  costs  to  maintain  adequate  traffic  operations.  No  rightofway  purchase  appears 
         to  be  required  for  either  option.  A  50%  contingency  is  added  to  the  total  to  account  for 
         design costs, unknown costs, and unexpected cost increases. Cost data are obtained from the 
         BRT  Practitioner's  Guide  (10)  and  Characteristics  of  Bus  Rapid  Transit,  2009  edition  (9).  Vehicles 
         are  assumed  to  cost  $800,000  each.  Converting  general  purpose  lanes  to  semiexclusive  bus 
         lanes  is  assumed  to  cost  $300,000  per  lane  mile  ($3  million  per  lane  mile  in  sections  where 
         more  extensive  reconstruction  is  required  for  the  Rapid  Bus  option),  constructing  new 
         median bus lanes is assumed to cost $10.2 million per lane mile, and a flyover is assumed to 
         cost  $30  million  per  lane  mile.  Technology  costs  are  included  in  the  perlanemile  estimates. 
         The  BRT  station  at  BART  was  assumed  to  cost  $3  million,  based  on  the  cost  of  multilevel 
         BRT  stations  in  Brisbane,  Australia  and  Ottawa,  Canada,  while  the  BRT  station  at  the 
         Airport  was  assumed  to  cost  $1  million,  based  on  the  cost  of  a  more  elaborate,  singlelevel 
         BRT  station  than  the  existing  AirBART  station,  including  fare  collection  capabilities.  As 
         described  in  the  traffic  analysis  in  Appendix  A,  Rapid  Bus  requires  modifying  the  traffic 
         signal  at  the  South  Coliseum/Hegenberger  intersection,  accompanied  by  signing  and 
         striping changes, in order to maintain satisfactory traffic operations. Full BRT requires street 
         widening  into  the  Edgewater  Drive  median  to  create  a  third  leftturn  lane,  and 
         reconstruction of the South Coliseum/Hegenberger intersection associated with constructing 
         the flyover. 
    ·    AGT:  Vehicle,  guideway,  and  station  costs  are  taken  from  the  BART  Board  of  Directors 
         meeting  agenda  where  the  construction  contract  was  approved  (4).  Contingency  and  other 
         costs (including financing and internal BART costs) are also taken from that agenda.

Reserves  for  vehicle  and  other  capital  equipment  replacement  (e.g., AGT  cables)  are  assumed  to  be 
$300,000 per year for AirBART, $670,000 per year for the Rapid Bus option and $600,000 per year for

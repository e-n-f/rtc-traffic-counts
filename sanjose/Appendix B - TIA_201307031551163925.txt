Subject:        Valley Christian Schools Bus Access Evaluation

                                                                                                    SJ12-1366


Fehr & Peers performed a bus access evaluation for Valley Christian Schools (VCS) located on
Skyway Drive in San Jose, California. The school is currently using and proposes to continue to use
Diamond Heights Drive as the main shuttle bus ingress access road to the school. The analysis
evaluated the existing volume of bus traffic on Diamond Heights Drive and projected increases
due to enrollment increases and potential shuttle bus program expansion. Implications to the
operations of the intersection of Senter Road / Diamond Heights Drive are also addressed.



EXISTING CONDITIONS

On May 15, 2012, Fehr & Peers conducted AM (7:00 am – 9:00 am) and PM (4:00 pm – 6:00 pm)
peak hour turning movement counts at Senter Road / Diamond Heights Drive intersection to
measure both the volumes of vehicles at the intersection and the number of buses on Diamond
Heights Drive. The counts resulted in 13 buses (13 inbound, 0 outbound) in the AM peak hour
and 4 buses (4 inbound, 0 outbound) in the PM peak hour on Diamond Heights Drive.



FUTURE CONDITIONS

VCS is proposing to increase its enrollment from 1,850 students to 2,300 students for a net
increase of 450 students or growth of approximately 25 percent. The increase in bus trips due to

the increase enrollment was estimated by increasing the existing numbers of buses by 25 percent.
This results in three additional bus trips in the AM peak hour and one additional bus trip in the
PM peak hour. These are conservative estimates since the existing buses are not full and have
capacity to accommodate some of the enrollment increase. The number of buses on Diamond
Heights Drive may also increase due the potential expansion of shuttle bus program, such as for
mitigation of the impact at the intersection of Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 southbound ramps.
This could increase the number of buses during the AM peak hour by two to four buses. These
added bus trips are not expected to affect operations on the nearby roadway facilities. They will
be added to two infrequent turning movements (the eastbound right-turn and westbound left
turn movements) at the Senter Road / Diamond Heights Drive intersection and therefore will not
increase vehicular delay no affect its operations.



CONCLUSIONS

The existing numbers of buses on Diamond Heights Drive are 13 buses during the AM peak hour
and 4 buses during the PM peak hour. The future volumes of buses due to proposed enrollment
increases and potential shuttle bus program expansion are 20 buses during the AM peak hour
and 5 buses during the PM peak hour. This increase in bus traffic will not affect operations of the
nearby roadway facilities.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the Valley Christian Schools
(VCS) Project in the City of San Jose, California. The VCS campus is located on Skyway Drive east of
Monterey Highway and south of Senter Road. The project proposes to expand the current student enrollment
to 2,300 students at the existing junior and high school campus. The current enrollment at the Skyway Drive
campus is 1,850 students (610 junior high school students and 1,240 senior high school students); therefore
the proposed expansion would add approximately 450 students to the campus. The school has environmental
clearance for 1,300 students; hence the traffic impacts are evaluated for a total increase of 1,000 students
(i.e., proposed minus approved).

The analysis was conducted to identify potential impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding
transportation system and to recommend appropriate improvements to mitigate significant impacts. Roadway
system operations were evaluated under Existing, Environmental Baseline, Existing (Environmental Baseline)
plus Project, Background, Project, Cumulative, and Cumulative plus Project Conditions. The results were
used to identify significant roadway system impacts. Impacts to the pedestrian, bicycle, and transit systems
were also evaluated.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic generated by the proposed project was estimated by applying rates based on traffic
counts conducted at the campus and the existing student enrollment of approximately 1,850 students. Trip
generation rates per student were determined for the AM and PM peak hours. The proposed project with an
additional 1,000 students is estimated to generate 640 AM peak-hour trips (350 inbound and 290 outbound)
and 280 PM peak-hour trips (130 inbound and 160 outbound).

INTERSECTION IMPACTS
A significant impact was identified for the intersection of Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 Southbound Ramps.
This intersection operates unacceptably in the AM and PM peak hours under Background Conditions. The
proposed project causes the delay to increase by more than four seconds during the AM peak hour, therefore
causing a significant impact. There are two options to mitigate the impact at this location: (1) decrease the
amount of project traffic added to it by limiting the number of students in the affected zip codes, increasing
carpool ridership and/or shuttle bus ridership in the area by adding new routes and/or new stops, and/or
changing project trip travel routes, and (2) add a third southbound left-turn lane. Although this intersection
would still operate unacceptably under Project Conditions with either of these mitigation measures, the impact
is reduced to a less-than-significant level because the increase in critical V/C and delay are lower than the
one percent and four second thresholds with the mitigation measures in place.

The mitigation measures discussed above also reduce project impacts to that intersection under Cumulative
plus Project Conditions to a less-than-significant level.

Other Intersections – There are other intersections projected to operate at unacceptable levels under Project
Conditions. The project does not cause a significant impact because the increases in critical V/C and delay do
not exceed the one percent and four second thresholds. These intersections include:

       Capitol Expressway/Snell Avenue in the AM peak hour

       Silver Creek Valley Road/US 101 Northbound Off-Ramp in the PM peak hour

Intersections that operate unacceptably but where the project does not have a significant impact under
Cumulative Conditions include:




                                                                                                             i

        Capitol Expressway/Snell Avenue (AM peak hour)

        Monterey Highway/Blossom Hill Road (N) (AM peak hour)

        Silver Creek Valley Road/US 101 Northbound Off-Ramp (PM peak hour)

A conceptual drawing of the mitigation measure is provided in Appendix G.

FREEWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS
The proposed project will not significantly impact any study freeway segments in the study area.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT FACILITY IMPACTS
The proposed project will not significantly impact pedestrian, bicycle or transit facilities in the study area
because the proposed project does not conflict with any existing or proposed pedestrian, bicycle, or transit
facilities. In addition, the project does not create hazardous conditions for pedestrians, bicyclists or transit
riders.

It is recommended that the sidewalk on the north side of Skyway Drive be extended west from its current
terminus to Houndshaven Way and that marked crosswalks be provided on the east and south legs of the
Skyway Drive/Houndshaven Way intersection.

SITE ACCESS AND ON-SITE CIRCULATION
Public vehicle access to the VCS campus is only provided via Skyway Drive. Diamond Heights Drive
connects the north side of the campus to Senter Road, but this connection is used for emergency vehicle
access only. (Allowing access for shuttle buses is included with the mitigation measure.) While some on-site
vehicle queuing does occur during peak travel periods, access is considered adequate for the volume of
traffic projected for the site.

On-site circulation is provided by a one-way counter-clockwise internal roadway. This roadway connects
various parking lots to each other and allows for drop-off/pick-up queue storage, where two lanes are
provided on some sections.

LEFT-TURN POCKET ON MONTEREY HIGHWAY AT SKYWAY DRIVE
The southbound left-turn pocket on Monterey Highway at Skyway Drive should be extended a minimum of 75
feet to provide 325 feet of vehicle storage.




                                                                                                              ii

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed enrollment
increase at the Valley Christian Schools located on Skyway Drive in the City of San Jose, California. The
proposal is to expand the student enrollment from the currently entitled 1,300 students to 2,300 students, an
increase of 1,000 students. It should be noted that the current enrollment is 1,850 students (610 junior high
students and 1,240 senior high students).

The analysis was conducted to identify the potential transportation impacts of the proposed enrollment
increase (the project) on the surrounding transportation system and to recommend appropriate improvements
to mitigate significant impacts. Figures 1a and 1b present the project location, surrounding roadway system,
and study intersection locations.

Project impacts were estimated following the guidelines of the City of San Jose, the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA), which is the congestion management agency for Santa Clara County, and the
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This report has been updated to include responses to
comments from City and Caltrans staff.

The freeway segments to which the amount of new traffic generated by the proposed enrollment increase is
anticipated to be more than one percent of the segment’s capacity were included in the analysis:

    1.   US 101 between State Route (SR) 85 and Bernal Road
    2.   US 101 between Bernal Road and Silver Creek Valley Road
    3.   SR 85 between Blossom Hill Road and SR 87
    4.   SR 85 between SR 87 and Almaden Expressway
    5.   SR 87 between Capitol Expressway and Curtner Avenue
    6.   SR 87 between Curtner Avenue and Almaden Expressway

    3.   US 101 Northbound Off-ramp to Silver Creek Valley Road
    4.   US 101 Southbound Off-ramp to Blossom Hill Road
    5.   SR 85 Southbound Off-Ramp to Blossom Hill Road

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
The operations of the key signalized intersections were evaluated during the weekday morning (AM) and
afternoon (PM) peak hours for the following scenarios:

         Scenario 1a:     Existing Conditions – Existing volumes obtained from counts.

         Scenario 1b:     Environmental Baseline Conditions – Existing volumes adjusted to account for only
                          the entitled enrollment (1,300 students) versus the actual enrollment (1,850
                          students).

         Scenario 1c:     Existing plus Project Conditions – Environmental baseline volumes plus traffic
                          generated by the proposed enrollment increase from the entitled level (1,300
                          students) to the proposed level (2,300 students).

         Scenario 2a:     Background Conditions – Environmental baseline volumes plus traffic from approved
                          but not yet constructed and unoccupied developments in the area.

         Scenario 2b:     Project Conditions – Background volumes plus traffic generated with the enrollment
                          increase from the approved level (1,300 students) to the proposed level (2,300
                          students).

         Scenario 3a:     Cumulative (No Project) Conditions – Environmental baseline volumes plus expected
                          growth through the anticipated expansion date, including traffic from approved and
                          pending projects.

         Scenario 3b:     Cumulative plus Project Conditions – Traffic volumes from Scenario 3a plus project
                          generated traffic.




                                                                                                          2

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the existing roadway facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, transit service, traffic
volumes, intersection operations, and freeway segment operations. It includes a discussion of the methods
used to calculate intersection and freeway segment levels of service and the corresponding results for both
Existing Conditions and for the Environmental Baseline Conditions.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
This section describes the existing roadway network near the Valley Christian Schools Skyway Drive campus,
which is illustrated on Figures 1a and 1b.

US 101 extends north to San Francisco and south to San Jose. US 101 near the project area is configured
with three mixed-flow lanes and one high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction. HOV lanes, also
known as diamond or carpool lanes restrict use to vehicles with two or more persons (carpool, vanpool, and
buses) or motorcycles during the morning (5:00 am to 9:00 am) and evening (3:00 pm to 7:00 pm) commute
periods. Interchanges at Blossom Hill Road and Capitol Expressway provide local access to the project area.

SR 85 extends from San Jose in the south and Mountain View in the north. Near the project area, SR 85
travels in an east-west direction and has two mixed-flow lanes and one HOV lane in each direction. Local
access to the project area is provided via an interchange at Blossom Hill Road.

SR 87 is a north-south freeway located west of the project area extending through San Jose from SR 85 to
US 101. Near the project area, SR 87 has two mixed-flow lanes and one HOV lane in each direction. Local
access to the project area is provided via an interchange at Capitol Expressway.

Monterey Highway (SR 82) is a north-south major arterial that extends from Gilroy in the south to San Jose in
the north. South of Gilroy SR 82 continues as US 101 to Los Angeles, and north of San Jose SR 82 continues
as El Camino Real to San Francisco. Near the project area, Monterey Highway has three lanes in each
direction and is separated by a median. The posted speed limit near the project area is 45 miles per hour
(mph).

Blossom Hill Road is an east-west arterial that extends from US 101 in the east to the Town of Los Gatos in
the west. Near the project area Blossom Hill Road has six lanes separated by a median and a posted speed
limit of 40 mph.

Capitol Expressway is an east-west expressway in the vicinity of the project site. The roadway connects
Interstate 680 in the east to Almaden Expressway in the west. Near the project area, Capitol Expressway has
six lanes, a median, and a posted speed limit of 45 mph.

Snell Avenue is a north-south arterial that extends from the Communications Hill area in the north to the
Santa Teresa Hills just south of Santa Teresa Boulevard. Snell Avenue provides two lanes of travel in each
direction from Branham Lane south to its terminus. Snell Avenue provides three travel lanes in each direction
north of Branham Lane to Capitol Expressway. Near the project area, the posted speed limit is 40 mph.

Skyway Drive is an east-west minor arterial that begins at Snell Avenue in the west and terminates east of
Monterey Highway. Skyway Drive serves as the primary access point into the Valley Christian Schools site.
The posted speed limit near the project area is 35 mph west of Monterey Highway and 25 mph east of
Monterey Highway.

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities comprise sidewalks, marked crosswalks, and pedestrian signals. Sidewalks are provided
on both sides of all arterials listed above except the west side of Monterey Highway, the south side of Capitol



                                                                                                                 6

Expressway west of Vistapark Drive and east of Snell Avenue, the west side of Snell Avenue between
Branham Lane and Chynoweth Avenue, both sides of Blossom Hill Road on the Monterey Highway
overcrossing, and the south side of Blossom Hill Road/Silver Creek Valley Road between Monterey Highway
and US 101 Northbound Off-ramp. Marked crosswalks and pedestrian signals are provided on at least three
legs of the four-legged study intersections and on at least two legs of the three-legged study intersections
except Monterey Highway/Capitol Expressway (South) and Monterey Highway/Valleyhaven Way because
there are no pedestrian facilities on the western side of Monterey Highway, Silver Creek Valley Road/US 101
Northbound Off-ramp because there are no pedestrian facilities on the southern side of Silver Creek Valley
Road, and Blossom Hill Road/US 101 Southbound Off-ramp because there are no pedestrian facilities on the
southern side of Blossom Hill Road.

Pedestrian access to the project site is provided via Skyway Drive. There is a continuous sidewalk on the
south side of Skyway Drive between Monterey Highway and Houndshaven Way, but only intermittent
sidewalks on the north side. There are no marked crosswalks at the Skyway Drive/Stoneyhaven Way and
Skyway Drive/Houndshaven Way intersections. The sidewalk on the southern side of the street is provided on
the public portion of the street and terminates less than 200 feet east of the intersection of Skyway
Drive/Houndshaven Way near the 90° turn on the private street section of Skyway Drive. Pedestrians cross
Skyway Drive at an unmarked crossing to utilize the sidewalk on the northern/western side of the street east
of Houndshaven Way and on the hill approaching the campus.

Bicycle Facilities

Bicycle facilities comprise bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes. Bike paths (Class I) are paved pathways
separated from roadways. Bike lanes (Class II) are lanes for bicyclists adjacent to the outer vehicle travel
lanes. These lanes have special lane markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bike routes are generally
located on low traffic volume streets that provide alternative routes for recreational, and in some cases,
commuter and school children cyclists. These facilities are designated Class III and are signed for bike use,
but have no separated bike right-of-way or lane striping.

Figure 2 shows the regional bicycle facilities serving the project area. No bike paths are provided in the
vicinity of the project site. Bike lanes are provided on Blossom Hill Road west of Snell Avenue, Branham Lane
west of Monterey Highway, Monterey Highway, Narvaez Avenue, Senter Road north of Capitol Expressway,
and Snell Avenue between Capitol Expressway and Blossom Hill Road. Bike routes are provided on
Chynoweth Avenue, Senter Road, and Vistapark Drive. VTA’s Bikeways Map rates Chynoweth Avenue as an
“Alert” facility to warn cyclists to take more precautions to avoid typically higher traffic volumes and vehicles
moving around the bicyclists’ path of travel. Senter Road is rated as both an “Alert” and “Moderate” facility.
Vistapark Drive is rated as a “Moderate” bicycle route, suggesting to bicyclists that the road has low traffic
volume, moderate to low speed traffic, wide travel areas for cyclists and low parking turnover or no on-street
parking.

Bicycle access to the project site is provided via Skyway Drive. There are no bike lanes on Skyway Drive.

EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSIT FACILITIES AND SERVICES
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) provides fixed-route bus service on 72 local routes in
Santa Clara County including within the city of San Jose. VTA also operates light rail service in Santa Clara
County. Figure 3 shows the existing transit facilities in the study area and Table 1 provides a summary of the
existing transit service in the study area.

VTA bus routes 42, 66, 68, 70, 72, 73, and 304 provide transit service in the vicinity of Valley Christian
School. Bus stops for the all routes except Route 70 are found near the intersection of Monterey Highway/
Skyway Drive. The campus is accessed from this stop via a half-mile walk along Skyway Drive to the center
of campus. Route 70 is accessible to its bus stop locations along Senter Road via Diamond Heights Drive.




                                                                                                               7

Valley Christian Schools Transportation Impact Analysis
June 2013



EXISTING TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT (TDM) PROGRAM
Valley Christian Schools employs Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies to reduce the
number of vehicles accessing the school site and therefore reduce the vehicle queue that forms on Skyway
Drive at the beginning and end of each school day, on-site traffic congestion, and parking demand. The TDM
measures include providing off-site parking at the Monterey Road/Fehren Drive park-and-ride lot with shuttles
to the school site, providing long-range shuttles to locations near the homes of students, and providing
staggered start times.

The school currently operates several buses, with a 60-student capacity each, between the Skyway Campus
and the Leigh Campus, Gilroy, Morgan Hill, Campbell, Cupertino, South San Jose (Oakridge), Milpitas, East
San Jose (Evergreen), and the Capitol Light Rail Station. A fee of $45 to $90 per student per direction per
month is assessed to ride these shuttles. Longer shuttle distances (such as the shuttle to/from Gilroy) have
higher fees than shorter shuttle distances (such as the shuttle to/from Campbell). Discounts are available for
families with two or more students bringing the fee to $63 to $126 per family per direction per month. A free
shuttle is also provided between the campus and the off-site parking facility at Monterey Highway and Fehren
Drive. The off-site parking facility shuttle is also available for parents that would like to avoid on-campus pick-
ups/drop-offs and would like to use the off-site parking facility as a pick-up/drop-off point instead. Figure 4
shows the locations of the shuttle bus pick-up/drop-off locations and Table 2 shows the shuttle bus schedule.
More detailed shuttle bus information such as the location of the bus stops is provided in Appendix D.

In addition, Valley Christian Schools has different class start times for students at the Skyway Drive campus.
Junior high students start at 8:20 am whereas high school students start at 7:40 am or 9:10 am depending on
their assigned A or B schedule. As such, vehicles arrive at the site over a longer, more dispersed time period
(instead of all arriving within the 15 to 20 minutes prior to a single start time).

The total number of parking spaces provided on the Valley Christian campus is 545 spaces. Of these, 280 are
dedicated to students, 200 dedicated to staff and faculty, 30 dedicated to visitors, 10 are ADA (Americans
with Disabilities Act) spaces, and 25 available for special occasions. Parking permits for students currently
cost $160 per school year, but rates for registered carpool vehicles are reduced to $80 per school year for
one additional passenger and $40 for two additional passengers. Of the 280 parking spaces available for
students, 37 spaces are designated for carpool vehicles, with these spaces being available on a first come,
first served basis. Students and staff are prohibited from parking in the surrounding neighborhoods.

Valley Christian Schools Transportation Impact Analysis
June 2013



EXISTING INTERSECTION VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
The operations of the key intersections were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours, the
highest one-hour volumes counted between 7:00 and 9:00 am and between 4:00 and 6:00 pm. Traffic
volumes were obtained from counts conducted at all of the study intersections to document field conditions at
the time the transportation study was being prepared. The traffic volumes are analyzed for consistency and
accuracy and incorporated in the City’s traffic volume database. The purpose of the database is to provide a
consistent set of traffic volumes for all projects. This ensures the base traffic conditions are the same for all
projects preparing transportation impact analyses.

Available intersection counts from April, September, and October 2008 were used for 16 of the 29 study
intersections. New intersection turning movement counts were conducted in April 2009 at the remaining
locations to supplement this information. Traffic counts were taken when classes at Valley Christian were in
session. The traffic counts taken during April, September, and October 2008 were compared to the counts
taken during April 2009. The traffic counts were generally consistent between both data collection periods.
Intersections improvements were recently constructed at the intersection of Monterey Highway and Blossom
Hill Road (North). Traffic counts collected in September and October 2012 after the improvements were
constructed were used in the analysis to account for any changes due to the improvements. The traffic counts
are included in Appendix A.

Figures 5a and 5b present the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes at the study
intersections. Figures 5a and 5b also present the existing intersection lane configurations and traffic control
devices.

LEVEL OF SERVICE AND RAMP QUEUING ANALYSIS METHODS
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six
levels are defined from LOS A, with the best operating conditions, to LOS F, with the worst operating
conditions. LOS E represents “at-capacity” operations. Operations are designated as LOS F when volumes
exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

The City of San Jose has established a minimum acceptable operating level of service (LOS) at LOS D for all
intersections including Congestion Management Program (CMP) designated intersections. The minimum
acceptable level for county controlled and CMP-monitored intersections is LOS E. The LOS standard for
freeway segments is LOS E.

Signalized Intersections

The level of service method approved by the City of San Jose, VTA, and Caltrans analyzes a signalized
intersection’s operation based on average control vehicular delay using the method described in Chapter 16
of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) by the Transportation Research Board, with adjusted saturation
flow rates to reflect Santa Clara County conditions. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue
move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized
intersections is calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software and correlated to a LOS designation as shown in
Table 3.

Freeway Segments

Freeway segments are evaluated using VTA’s analysis procedure, which is based on the density of the traffic
flow using methods described in the 2000 HCM. Density is expressed in passenger cars per mile per lane.
The Congestion Management Program range of densities for freeway segment level of service is shown in
Table 4.

Ramp Queuing

Ramp queuing is evaluated using a combination of field observations and comparisons of the amount of
added traffic to the significance threshold set as 1 percent of the ramp’s capacity. For on-ramps, field
observations are conducted to determine whether there are existing or potential queuing problems that could
affect city street operations. If there are, then the ramp capacity is determined as either the ramp metering
rate or 1,800 vehicles per hour, whichever is lower. For off-ramps, field observations are conducted to
determine whether there are existing or potential queuing problems that could affect freeway operations. If
there are, then the capacities of the individual turn movements of the ramp terminal intersection are
calculated by dividing “Final Vol” by “Volume/Cap” from the TRAFFIX output sheet. The ramp capacity is
computed as the sum of the individual turn movement capacities. The amount of traffic added by the project is
compared to 1 percent of the capacity for both on and off-ramps. If it is equal to or greater than 1 percent of
the capacity and there are safety concerns, there is a significant impact.

EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Existing intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning movement volumes were used
as inputs for the level of service calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions are
presented in Table 5. All signalized study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service
according to the standard (LOS D) set forth by the City of San Jose, except the following locations:

        Capitol Expressway and Snell Avenue (AM peak hour)

        Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 Southbound Ramps (AM peak hour)

All study CMP intersections operate acceptably according to the VTA standards (LOS E or better).

Field Observations

Field observations were conducted in May 2009 to verify the calculated operations of the study intersections
and locations of long vehicle queues. During the PM peak hour, southbound left-turning traffic queued out of
the turn pocket at the Capitol Expressway/Senter Road intersection and blocked through traffic. The long left-
turn queues occasionally did not clear the intersection but typically cleared within one or two signal cycles.
Also, southbound left-turning traffic queued out of pocket at the Monterey Highway/Senter Road intersection.
The long left-turn queues did not clear the intersection about 50 percent of the time but typically cleared within
one or two signal cycles. Also, a few movements were noted to have queues that did not clear at the
Monterey Highway/Chynoweth Avenue intersection, although the queues cleared within one additional signal
cycle. Queues at the other study intersections did not have a substantial effect on traffic flow.

EXISTING FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Freeway segment densities reported in VTA’s 2007 Monitoring and Conformance Report were used to
calculate the levels of service for the key freeway segments during the AM and PM peak hours. The results of
the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions are presented in Table 6.

The following mixed-flow lane segments are operating at unacceptable levels (LOS F) according to VTA
standards:

         Northbound SR 85, SR 87 to Almaden Expressway (AM peak hour)

         Southbound SR 85, Almaden Expressway to SR 87 (PM peak hour)

         Southbound SR 85, SR 87 to Blossom Hill Road (PM peak hour)

         Northbound SR 87, Capitol Expressway to Curtner Avenue (AM peak hour)

         Northbound SR 87, Curtner Avenue to Almaden Expressway (AM peak hour)



                                                                                                                                    20

RAMP QUEUING OBSERVATIONS
During the AM peak period, metering lights on the SR 87 northbound on-ramp caused long southbound right-
turn and northbound left-turn queues on Narvaez Avenue. The traffic on Narvaez Avenue queued back from
the SR 87 ramps to the upstream intersections. The high traffic volume and long queues did not limit the
ability of vehicles to continue southbound on Narvaez Avenue. However, northbound through traffic was
impeded. Queues usually did not clear the intersection of Narvaez Avenue with Capitol Expressway due to
the metering light queues extending from the on-ramp.

Due to long metering light queues at the eastbound Blossom Hill Road to northbound US 101 loop ramp,
vehicles were seen bypassing the ramp, making a U-turn at the intersection with US 101 Northbound
Ramp/Coyote Road, and then entering the freeway via the westbound Blossom Hill Road to northbound US
101 directional ramp where metering light queues were shorter.

Queues due to the metering lights for the westbound Blossom Hill Road to northbound SR 85 direct on-ramp
spilled back to the Blossom Hill Road/Snell Avenue intersection during the AM peak hour. Southbound right
turning traffic at the Blossom Hill Road/Snell Avenue intersection was impeded due to the heavy on-ramp
queues spilled back to Giuffrida Avenue. Queues due to the metering lights at the eastbound Blossom Hill
Road to northbound SR 85 loop on-ramp almost spilled back to the Blossom Hill Road/Blossom Avenue
intersection during the AM peak hour.

Heavy off-ramp queues were observed at the SR 85 Off-ramp/Blossom Hill Road/Blossom Avenue
intersection during the PM peak hour. The southbound queues almost extended onto the freeway mainline.

OBSERVATIONS OF ON-SITE SCHOOL TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Field visits were conducted in May 2009 to observe the general operations of the school drop off/pick up
activities. The VCS campus currently provides vehicle access from Skyway Drive and emergency vehicle
access from Diamond Heights Drive. During the peak 15-minute drop-off period before school and at end of
each school day, long queues form on-site from the top of the hill, extend down the hill, and continue towards
the Monterey Highway/Skyway Drive intersection. Exiting queues form on westbound Skyway Drive at the
intersection with Monterey Highway and extend uphill towards the school site. This queue dissipates quickly
and no other impacts were observed throughout the day in general.

ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE CONDITIONS
Environmental Baseline Conditions were evaluated by subtracting trips generated by the number of enrolled
Valley Christian School students above the approved enrollment (1,850 – 1,300 = 550 students) from the
existing traffic volumes and re-evaluating intersection and freeway segment levels of service. The reductions
were based on the trip generation rates and trip distribution discussed in Chapter 3. The additional enrollment
of 550 students is estimated to generate 352 existing AM peak-hour trips (192 inbound and 160 outbound)
and 154 existing PM peak-hour trips (66 inbound and 88 outbound). Table 7 summarizes the trip generation
estimates.

Environmental Baseline Intersection Operations

Environmental Baseline intersection volumes are presented in Figures 6a and 6b. The intersection lane
configurations and traffic control devices are the same as Existing Conditions. A level of service analysis was
conducted to evaluate intersection operations and the results are presented in Table 8. Appendix B contains
the corresponding calculation sheets.

All signalized study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service according to the standard (LOS D)
set forth by the City of San Jose, except for the following locations:

            Capitol Expressway and Snell Avenue (AM peak hour)

            Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 Southbound Ramps (AM peak hour)

All study CMP intersections operate acceptably according to the VTA standards (minimum LOS E).

 Notes:
 1        Whole intersection weighted average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle calculated using methods described in the
          2000 HCM, with adjusted saturation flow rates to reflect Santa Clara County Conditions. Total control delay for the worst
          movement is presented for side-street stop-controlled intersections. Delay for the worst approach is reported for unsignalized
          intersections.
 2        LOS = Level of service. LOS calculations conducted using the TRAFFIX level of service analysis software package.
 3        3-way stop control modeled as a side-street stop controlled intersection in TRAFFIX.
 *        CMP intersection.




Environmental Baseline Freeway Operations

Freeway segment densities and levels of service were also calculated Environmental Baseline Conditions.
The results are presented in Table 9. Similar to Existing Conditions, the following mixed-flow lane segments
operate at unacceptable levels (LOS F) according to VTA standards:

         Northbound SR 85, SR 87 to Almaden Expressway (AM peak hour)

         Southbound SR 85, Almaden Expressway to SR 87 (PM peak hour)

         Southbound SR 85, SR 87 to Blossom Hill Road (PM peak hour)

         Northbound SR 87, Capitol Expressway to Curtner Avenue (AM peak hour)

         Northbound SR 87, Curtner Avenue to Almaden Expressway (AM peak hour)

         Southbound SR 87, Almaden Expressway to Curtner Avenue (PM peak hour)

         Northbound US 101, Bernal Road to Silver Creek Valley Road (AM peak hour)

The following high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane segment operates at an unacceptable level (LOS F):

         Northbound SR 85, SR 87 to Almaden Expressway (AM peak hour)

3. EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
The Existing plus Project scenario describes a traffic condition that would occur if the project was constructed
and VCS student enrollment increased under current traffic conditions. It is unlikely that this condition would
occur because other approved projects in the area will likely be constructed and occupied while this project is
going through its development review process. This scenario describes a less-congested traffic condition that
ignores any potential traffic from other prior approvals. The City of San Jose uses Project Conditions discuss
in Chapter 5 to assess project impacts. The associated significance criteria are also described in Chapter 5.
Those criteria were applied under Existing Plus Project Conditions for informational purposes.

The traffic volumes for this scenario include the Environmental Baseline traffic volumes plus traffic generated
by the project, an increase in student enrollment from 1,300 students to 2,300 students. The school was
originally approved for an enrollment of 1,200 students plus a 100-child day care center. However, the day
care center was not constructed. For this analysis, the approved 100 day care children were replaced with
school students. A trip generation comparison of day care versus school is presented to illustrate that the
school would generate fewer trips.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic added to the roadway system by the proposed expansion of Valley Christian Schools is
estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. The first
step estimates the amount of traffic added to the roadway network. The second step estimates the directions
of travel to and from the campus. The trips are assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning
movements during the third step. The results of the process for the VCS expansion are described in the
following sections.

Trip Generation

The amount of traffic generated by the enrollment increase was estimated by applying rates derived from
driveway counts of the existing campus that were conducted in October 2008. The surveyed rates were
based on the existing student enrollment of approximately 1,850 students. Trip generation rates per student
during the AM and PM peak hours are 0.64 and 0.28, respectively as shown in Table 10. The 1,000-student
increase to the projected enrollment of 2,300 students is estimated to generate 640 new AM peak-hour trips
(350 inbound and 290 outbound) and 280 new PM peak-hour trips (120 inbound and 160 outbound).

Comparison of Surveyed Trip Generation Rates to ITE Rates

The trip generation rates for private schools presented in Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation, 9th Edition are 0.81 trips per student for the AM peak hour and 0.17 trips per student for the PM
peak hour. The AM rate is 20 percent higher and the PM rate is 50 percent lower than the rates observed at
the VCS campus. The differences in the trip rates may be due to a few factors, including:

       The ITE rates are based on a limited number of studies (5 trip generation surveys for the AM peak
        hour and 3 for the PM peak hour) and may not reflect a similar environment as the San Jose area.

       The ITE rates are for private schools serving grades K-12 and not grades 7-12 like VCS.

       VCS may have a lower AM trip rate due to the shuttle programs, carpool incentives, transportation
        coordinator, etc.

       VCS may have more after school activities than the schools studied in Trip Generation.

Furthermore, ITE recommends using local data if the land use is not covered in Trip Generation, if there is an
inadequate number of studies in Trip Generation, and if the local trip rates are not within a 15% difference of


                                                                                                                 30

the ITE rates. Therefore, the VCS-specific trip generation rates were used in analyzing the traffic generation
of the new students to reflect the actual operations of the school.

A day care center would generate more vehicle trips than the school. Therefore, converting the approved 100-
day care students to school students for the purpose of this analysis is a conservative assumption.

Trip Distribution

The directions of approach and departure for the project traffic were estimated based on zip code data of
existing students, the existing travel patterns in the area, and the relative locations of complementary land
uses including residential and commercial land uses. The major directions of approach and departure from
the trip distribution pattern for the project, and are illustrated on Figure 7.

Trip Assignment

The trips generated by the enrollment increase were assigned to the roadway system based on the directions
of approach and departure discussed above. Figures 8a and 8b show the AM and PM peak-hour project trips
assigned to each turning movement at the study intersections. These trips were added to the environmental
baseline traffic volumes to establish intersection volumes for Existing plus Project Conditions, as shown on
Figures 9a and 9b.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
The results of the intersection level of service calculations for Existing plus Project Conditions are presented
in Table 12. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets. The results for Environmental
Baseline Conditions are included for comparison purposes, along with the projected increases in critical delay
and critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Critical delay represents the delay associated with the critical
movements of the intersection, or the movements that require the most “green time” and have the greatest
effect on overall intersection operations. Some of the intersections show reduced delays compared to
Environmental Baseline Conditions. This occurs when traffic is added to intersection approaches with low
delays thus reducing the weighted average intersection delay.

The following signalized intersections operate at unacceptable levels of service under Existing plus Project
Conditions:

       Capitol Expressway and Snell Avenue (AM peak hour)

       Blossom Hill Road and SR 85 Southbound Ramps (AM peak hour)

These intersections also operate at unacceptable levels under Environmental Baseline Conditions; however
increases to average vehicle delays and critical V/C ratios do not amount to significant impacts under City of
San José TIA guidelines. All other signalized intersections continue to operate acceptably during both peak
periods. Therefore the addition of project traffic does not cause unacceptable operations at any of the
signalized study intersections.

INTRODUCTION


Initial Study

Pursuant to Section 15063 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines (Title 14,
California Code of Regulations, Sections 15000 et seq.), an Initial Study is a preliminary environmental
analysis that is used by the lead agency as a basis for determining whether an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR), a Mitigated Negative Declaration, or a Negative Declaration is required for a project. The
State CEQA Guidelines require that an Initial Study contain a project description, description of
environmental setting, identification of environmental effects by checklist or other similar form,
explanation of environmental effects, discussion of mitigation for significant environmental effects,
evaluation of the project's consistency with existing, applicable land use controls, and the names of
persons who prepared the study.

The purpose of this Initial Study is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
Evergreen Valley College (EVC) 2025 Facilities Master Plan (FMP) and to determine what level of
additional environmental review, if any, is appropriate. As shown in the Determination in Section IV of
this document and based on the analysis contained in this Initial Study, the San José/Evergreen
Community College District has determined that the proposed EVC 2025 FMP could result in potentially
significant impacts; therefore, preparation of an EIR is appropriate.

Anticipated Project Approvals

The San José/Evergreen Community College District (SJECCD) will prepare an EIR that fully evaluates
the environmental effects associated with the implementation of the proposed 2025 FMP. Necessary
project approvals are anticipated to include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following by the
SJECCD Board of Trustees (anticipated in spring/summer 2012):

      Certification of the EVC 2025 FMP EIR and

      Approval of the proposed EVC 2025 FMP.


Public and Agency Review

The Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the EIR and this Initial Study will be circulated for public and
agency review from July 10, 2012 through August 9, 2012. Copies of the Initial Study are available during
normal operating hours at the District office at the address below and online at sjeccd.edu. Comments on
the NOP/Initial Study must be received by 5:00 PM on August 9, 2012. They may be e-mailed to
douglas.smith@sjeccd.edu.or sent to:

II.         PROJECT LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION

1.      Description of the Project:

        Location: The EVC campus is located at 3095 Yerba Buena Road in east-central San José in Santa
        Clara County. The location of the campus within Santa Clara County and the City of San José is
        shown in Figure 1, Regional and Site Location. The campus is near the eastern City boundary and
        is bounded by San Felipe Road to the west, Yerba Buena Road to the south, Montgomery Hill Park
        to the east, and Falls Creek Drive to the north. The campus encompasses about 165.5 acres. The
        northern portion of campus consists of a hillside area while the southern portion of the campus is
        flat and is referred to as the "plains."

        Project Need: The 2025 FMP translates the program space needs established in the EVC 2025
        Educational Master Plan into physical facilities on the campus. According to the 2025 Educational
        Master Plan for the EVC campus, total enrollment on campus is expected to reach approximately
        14,850 students by 2025, which equates to 9,100 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) students (FTES). Based
        on these projections, future program needs on the campus total approximately 355,175 square feet
        of space, calculated based on allowable standards referenced in the California Code of Regulations
        Title 5. The amount of space required on the campus takes into account of all facility needs of the
        campus ­ academic space as well as space for support services. The 2025 Education Master Plan
        determined that EVC does not show any significant need for additional space through the year
        2025, although there are needs in certain specific space categories.

        Project Characteristics: The 2025 FMP involves reorganization of campus facilities and
        reconfiguration of campus access and circulation. The proposed 2025 FMP for the EVC campus is
        depicted in Figure 2, Evergreen Valley College 2025 Facilities Master Plan. The recommendations
        contained in the 2025 FMP address the current and projected needs of the campus through 2025.

        Facility recommendations contained in the 2025 FMP include (1) the demolition/removal of
        existing building on campus; (2) the construction of new buildings on campus; and (3) the
        renovation of existing buildings on campus to meet the future programs needs as outlined in 2025
        Educational Master Plan. A description of each of these elements is provided below.

        Recommended Demolition/Removal
        The 2025 FMP identifies several buildings for demolition/removal to eliminate non-functioning
        space and replace the oldest and most aged facilities with new facilities. Facilities identified by the
        2025 FMP for demolition/removal include Cluster Acacia, Cluster Roble, Racquetball Courts, and
        all portable buildings. The location of each of these facilities is shown in Figure 3, Recommended
        Demolition/Removal Plan.

        New Construction Projects
        Descriptions of new construction projects planned on the EVC campus are organized into groups
        based on campus location. The order of the projects does not reflect priority order or a
        recommended sequence of development. Preliminary phasing plans will be developed following
        the completion of the 2025 FMP and will be tied to availability of funding.

        Math/Science Complex ­ The new Math/Science Complex would be part of a South Campus
        Development project and would provide new instructional space and be coordinated with the
        removal of the aging Cluster Acacia. The multi-story complex would include dedicated labs and
        flexible classroom to support the science and math programs. The proposed location, to the south
        of the Gullo Student Center building (Gullo I) in the center of the campus, ties into the lower level
        of the Student Center and would bring activity to an underutilized area of the campus. The new
        outdoor gathering space would be framed by buildings to create connections to the "plains" area
        of the campus.

        Automotive Technology ­ The Automotive Technology Building would replace aging facilities
        that are currently part of Cluster Acacia. Its new northwest campus location would also have the
        "Hillside" as a backdrop and be located near the new parking lot with photovoltaic canopies.

        General Education Building ­ The General Education Building would be part of a South Campus
        Development project and would provide replacement classroom space as the aging cluster
        buildings are removed from the campus. The proposed location, adjacent to the Math/Science
        Complex, would help to define the new outdoor areas to the south of Gullo I. This multi-story
        instructional building would include multi-purpose, flexible instructional space to support a
        variety of disciplines.

        GED/Engineering/Language Arts/Social Science ­ This facility would be located in the northwest
        portion of campus on the site vacated by the demolition of cluster Roble. It would anchor the
        Village Walk West, with the "Hillside" as a backdrop, and would help redefine the western edge
        of the campus. This multi-story instructional building would include multi-purpose, flexible,
        instructional space to support general education, engineering, language arts, and social science.

        Fitness Center ­ The proposed 7,000 square-foot Fitness Center would be part of a South Campus
        Development project and is proposed to be located to the south of the Physical Education building,
        adjacent to the athletic fields. The facility is in close proximity to the Fitness Walk and operable
        windows would provide broad views to the grass sports field (the "Plains"). This may be the first
        LEED® project on the campus.

        Renovation Projects
        The 2025 FMP recommends renovations to several buildings. A description of renovation projects
        planned on the EVC campus is provided below. The order of the projects does not reflect priority
        order or a recommended sequence of development. In addition to the projects highlighted below,
        the 2025 FMP recommends the renovation of all other existing campus facilities as required.

        Central Plant/Campus Police Building ­ During the planning process, the Central Plant/Campus
        Police Building was analyzed in order to determine the best course of action for the future. Both
        renovation and replacement facilities were considered, but ultimately the decision was made to
        renovate the existing Central Plant/Campus Police Building in its current location. This decision
        was considered to be the most economical and would save over $8 million compared to the cost of
        new facilities. Mechanical equipment in the Central Plant would be upgraded, electrical service
        equipment would be replaced, and staff areas would be improved. The District's Police
        Department, which operates from the Campus Police Building, would expand to allow more
        efficient operations and provide a secure environment responsive to current District needs. The
        exterior of the building would be improved to reflect a more consistent campus architectural

        theme and to provide a more recognizable presence for Campus Police.

        Administration/Student Services Center ­The 2025 FMP recommends that the
        Administration/Student Services Center be studied in conjunction with the Admission & Records
        (A&R) building with the goal of developing a long-range plan that addresses both current budget
        and staffing reductions, which will potentially affect the configuration and uses of the building,
        and the long-term needs of the College.

        Admissions & Records Building ­ A&R has also been identified as a building requiring
        operational-related renovations. The 2025 FMP recommends that the A&R building be studied in
        conjunction with the Administration/Student Services Center with the goal of developing a long-
        range plan that addresses both current budget and staffing reductions, which will potentially
        affect the configuration and uses of the building, and the long-term needs of the College.

        Gullo I ­ The 2025 FMP recommends that Gullo I, the Student Center, be reconfigured to provide
        additional space for the Student Activities Center. This would consolidate most student activities
        in one location. There is a potential under the FMP to relocate the bookstore; further study of this
        issue would be needed.

        Gullo II ­ Gullo II is primarily used as a multi-functional event and community room. It has a
        capacity to hold 250-300 people; however, acoustically it functions poorly. The 2025 FMP
        recommends that the location of a new large multi-purpose event room be studied and that this
        function vacate Gullo II. The 2025 FMP further recommends that this space be reprogrammed and
        renovated to house a new café and informal student gathering area.

        Site Improvements
        In addition to the recommendations for facilities, a series of site improvement recommendations
        were identified in the 2025 FMP, consisting of a recommended vehicular circulation plan, a
        recommended pedestrian circulation plan, and recommended landscape improvements. These are
        show in Figure 4, Recommended Vehicular Circulation Plan; Figure 5, Recommended
        Pedestrian Circulation Plan; and Figure 6, Recommended Landscape Improvements.


2.      Project objectives:
        The primary objective of the 2025 FMP is to provide the necessary facilities to accommodate the
        planned 2025 student population for the EVC campus.

3.      Surrounding land uses and environmental setting:

        The campus is in a suburban setting that has experienced substantial commercial and residential
        development in the past several years. Nearby uses include residential uses to the north beyond
        Evergreen Creek, to the west beyond Thompson Creek, and to the south beyond Yerba Buena
        Creek; Falls Creek Park to the north; Evergreen Park and a church to the south; Montgomery Hill
        Park and undeveloped lands to the east; and an assisted-living facility to the west. Figure 7,
        Surrounding Land Uses, depicts the location of these land uses in relation to the EVC campus.

IV.         DETERMINATION:

On the basis of the initial evaluation that follows:

           I find that the proposed project WOULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and a
   
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

           I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there
           will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been made that will
   
           avoid or reduce any potential significant effects to a less than significant level. A MITIGATED
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

           I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment. An
           ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT will be prepared.

V.          EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

During the completion of the environmental evaluation, the SJECCD relied on the following categories of
impacts, noted as column headings in the IS checklist.

A)         "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that the project's
           effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impacts" for which
           effective mitigation may not be possible, an EIR will be prepared.

B)         "Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies where the incorporation of
           project-specific mitigation would reduce an effect from "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less
           Than Significant Impact."

C)         "Less Than Significant Impact" applies where the project would not result in a significant effect
           (i.e., the project impact would be less than significant without the need to incorporate mitigation).

D)         "No Impact" applies where the project would not result in any impact in the category or the
           category does not apply. This may be because the impact category does not apply to the proposed
           project (for instance, the project site is not within a surface fault rupture hazard zone), or because
           of other project-specific factors.

 1. AESTHETICS ­ Would the project:

 a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?                                                             
 b) Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but
 not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic                                                              
 buildings within a state scenic highway?

 c) Substantially degrade the existing visual character or                                                           
 quality of the site and its surroundings?

 d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare
 which would adversely affect day or nighttime views in                                                              
 the area?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
campus is located in a hilly region, but the topography of the campus is relatively flat and the campus is
mostly developed. Based on a review of the San José 2020 General Plan, there are no scenic vistas that
include the campus as a major part of the view (San José 1994).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) A scenic vista is generally defined as an expansive view of highly valued landscape as observable from
a publicly accessible vantage point. Although there are views across the campus to the San Felipe Hills,
and views from within the campus that are of high visual quality, the existing development on the
campus itself does not interfere with visual resources. There are no scenic vistas that include the campus
as a major part of the view. The campus is screened from the view of adjacent residents south of Park
Estates Way by riparian vegetation to the south of the campus. The campus is partially screened from the
view of adjacent residents north of Falls Creek Drive by the existing District Warehouse and riparian
vegetation. Views of the north campus parking lot and portions of campus buildings are available from
areas along Falls Creek Drive; however, these views are not of high visual quality (SJECCD 2000). Distant
views of the campus are available from higher elevations along Yerba Buena Road southwest of the
campus; from these viewpoints, campus development appears against the backdrop of surrounding
residential development and open space.

The proposed new structures would be sited in undeveloped areas of the campus. However, the
proposed facilities would be similar in type and scale to the existing college facilities and would be built
within the existing campus boundaries. Furthermore, as noted above, there are no scenic vistas that
include the campus as a major part of the view. Therefore, there would not be a substantial change to any

0461.004                                                                                                             July 2012
scenic vistas. Based on these factors, the proposed project would have no impact with regard to this
criterion.

b) There are no state-designated scenic highways in the vicinity of the campus (CSHP 2011). Therefore,
changes on the campus as a result of the 2025 FMP implementation would not affect visual resources
associated with any state-designated or local scenic highway. There would be no impact with regard to
this criterion.

c) Facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would be similar in type and scale to existing facilities on the
campus, and new facilities would be constructed entirely within the campus. However, there is still the
potential that implementation of the 2025 FMP could alter the existing visual character and quality of the
campus as viewed from the surrounding neighborhoods. In addition, the construction of facilities
identified in the 2025 FMP could result in the loss of mature trees, which would further alter the existing
visual character of the campus. This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of the 2025
FMP on the existing visual character or quality of the campus and its surroundings will be analyzed in
the EIR.

d) Existing buildings on the campus are a source of light and glare, and cars on the campus may also be a
source of glare. Other existing sources of light and glare on the campus include sports facilities and
lighting in parking lots and along pathways. New buildings proposed under the 2025 FMP would shift
some light and glare sources within the campus, and could increase light and glare in parts of the
campus. This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of light and glare associated with the
2025 FMP implementation on the campus and its surroundings will be analyzed in the EIR.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The proposed project combined with other current projects and probable future projects and projected
regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to visual character and light
and glare. These issues will be addressed in the EIR.

 2. AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY RESOURCES ­
 Would the project:

 a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
 Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland), as
 shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland

 Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?

 b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a                                                               
 Williamson Act contract?

 c) Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of,
 forest land (as defined in Public Resources Code section
 12220(g)), timberland (as defined in Public Resources                                                                     
 Code Section 4526), or Timberland zoned Timberland
 Production (as defined by Government Code section
 51104(g))?

 d) Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest                                                              
 land to non-forest use?

 e) Involve other changes in the existing environment,
 which, due to their location or nature, could result in                                                                   
 conversion of Farmland, to non-agricultural use or
 conversion of forest land to non-forest use?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
campus is designated as Urban and Built-Up Land and Other Land on maps prepared by the California
State Department of Conservation pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP)
(FMMP 2011).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The entire campus is developed and located in a developed area of the City of San José. The campus is
not used for agriculture, and is not designated as Farmland on maps prepared by the California State
Department of Conservation pursuant to the FMMP. There would be no impact with regard to this
criterion.

b-c) Although the campus is not subject to City zoning, the campus is zoned for urban use by the City of
San José. No portion of the campus is zoned for agricultural use, forest land, or timberland. In addition,

there is no Williamson Act contract applicable to the campus. Therefore, future development on the
campus would not conflict with existing zoning for agricultural or forest land or timberland use or with a
Williamson Act contract. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

d) The campus and surrounding area does not include any forest land or timberland. There would be no
impact with regard to this criterion.

e) No Farmland or other agricultural land is present in the vicinity of the campus. Therefore,
implementation of the 2025 FMP would not involve any changes that could indirectly cause conversion of
Farmland to non-agricultural use. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The City of San José is urban in nature, and is not designated as Farmland on maps prepared pursuant to
the FMMP. As a result, anticipated future development in San José, including the future development on
the campus under the 2025 FMP, would not result in the loss of Farmland. In addition, land in the City is
zoned for urban uses. Therefore, anticipated future development in San José would not displace land
zoned for agricultural use or forest land or timberland, and would not conflict with land under a
Williamson Act contact. The impact of cumulative development on agricultural and forest resources
would be less than significant.

 3. AIR QUALITY ­ Where available, the significance
 criteria established by the applicable air quality
 management or air pollution control district may be
 relied upon to make the following determinations.
 Would the project:

 a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the                                                                   
 applicable air quality plan?

 b) Violate any air quality standard or contribute
 substantially to an existing or projected air quality                                                                
 violation?

 c) Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of
 any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-
 attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient                                                              
 air quality standard (including releasing emissions
 which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
 precursors)?

 d) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant                                                               
 concentrations?

 e) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial
 number of people?                                                                                                    

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
nearest sensitive receptors to the campus include single-family residential uses to the north, south, and
west. Other sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the campus include Evergreen Park and Church on the
Rock - Baptist to the south; Montgomery Hill Park to the east; and an assisted-living facility to the west.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a-c) The campus is located in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, which is currently designated a non-
attainment area for PM10 (particulate matter 10 microns or less in diameter), PM2.5 (particulate matter
2.5 microns or less in diameter), and ozone. Construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025
FMP would be likely to add incrementally to regional ambient air pollutant emissions including short-
and long-term emissions of criteria air pollutants from mobile and stationary sources. This represents a
potentially significant impact. The EIR will estimate the total emissions from construction and operation
of future buildings identified in the 2025 FMP and evaluate whether the emissions would exceed the Bay

0461.004                                                                                                               July 2012
Area Air Quality Monitoring District (BAAQMD) recommended thresholds for evaluating impacts from
criteria pollutant emissions.

d) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would result in on-site emissions of diesel
particulate matter, which the California Air Resources Board has identified as a toxic air contaminant. In
addition, operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP could impact nearby sensitive receptors by
creating the potential for localized CO hotspots. This represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR
will evaluate concentrations of CO, toxic air contaminants, and other pollutants associated with the 2025
FMP to determine whether they would result in a significant effect on sensitive receptors.

e) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would require the use of diesel-fueled equipment
and architectural coatings, both of which have an associated odor. However, these odors would be short-
term and temporary and would not be pervasive enough to affect a substantial number of people or to be
objectionable. Routine operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would not involve activities that
typically produce odors such as wastewater treatment, manufacturing, agriculture, etc. Occasional use of
maintenance products on the campus could produce odors but they would be temporary and limited in
area. Consequently, odors associated with short-term construction and long-term operation of facilities
under the 2025 FMP would not cause or be affected by odors, and the impact would be less than
significant.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative
impacts with regard to air quality. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

  4. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES ­ Would the project:

  a) Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or
  through habitat modifications, on any species identified
  as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local

  conservation plan?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
campus is located within a suburban setting within the Evergreen Valley. A majority of the campus is
developed, except for undeveloped areas in the northern and southern portions of campus (SJECCD
2000). The undeveloped portions of the campus consist mainly of disturbed grasslands.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The most recent versions of the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) and California Native
Plant Society (CNPS) databases were reviewed for the vicinity of the campus. According to CNDDB and
CNPS query results, several special-status plant and wildlife species have been documented in the project
area (i.e., within 3 miles of the campus). Undeveloped grasslands may provide habitat for special-status
species and development under the 2025 FMP could disturb these species. This represents a potentially
significant impact. The EIR will analyze potential impacts to special-status plant and wildlife species and
associated habitat potentially occurring on or near the campus.

b) The campus is generally developed, and is not identified in any adopted plan as having sensitive
natural communities. However, there are undeveloped areas in the northern and southern portions of the
campus, and two creeks, Thompson Creek and Yerba Buena Creek, are located near the western and
southern campus boundaries, respectively. In addition, there is an unnamed drainage north of the
campus (SJECCD 2000). As a result, development under the 2025 FMP could impact the riparian habitats
present along these drainages. This represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR will identify and
analyze potential impacts regarding sensitive and/or riparian habitats within or near the campus.

c) Evergreen Lake is located within the southeast portion of the campus, and further analysis is required
to determine if this lake may be considered a federally protected wetland or waters of the United States.
Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP in the vicinity of Evergreen Lake could affect this
feature. Additionally, further analysis is required to determine if wetland habitats occur within the
undeveloped grassland portions of the campus in the areas where new facilities would be built under the
2025 FMP. Therefore, impacts to jurisdictional resources are considered a potentially significant impact.
The EIR will identify and analyze impacts regarding impacts to jurisdictional resources.

d) Undeveloped portions of the campus contain disturbed grassland that provides biological resource
values, including habitat for wildlife. In addition, two creeks, Thompson Creek and Yerba Buena Creek,
are located near the western and southern boundaries of the campus. Therefore, the campus may provide
wildlife movement corridors or nursery sites, and the implementation of the 2025 FMP could have
impacts on such resources). In addition, mature trees on the campus could provide nesting habit to
migratory bird species that are protected under state and federal laws. Construction activity associated
with development under the 2025 FMP could result in the removal of trees on the campus. If removal of
trees occurred during breeding season, this action could result in the disruption of nesting activities. This
represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR will identify and evaluate potential impacts related to
wildlife movement corridors or nesting migratory birds.

e) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP may require the removal of some trees, regardless
of health, to facilitate development or to mitigate potentially hazardous circumstances related to their
proximity to existing facilities. The City of San José has a tree ordinance that requires a permit for
removal of any trees on private property that have a trunk circumference of 56 inches or more, measured
2 feet above grade. As a state entity, the SJECCD is exempted by the state constitution from compliance
with local land use regulations and ordinances. There would be no impact with respect to this criterion.

f) No adopted habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan applies to the campus.
There would be no impact with respect to this criterion. However, a habitat conservation plan/natural
community conservation plan is currently being prepared for the Santa Clara Valley and the campus is
located within the boundaries of the plan.

 feature?

 d) Disturb any human remains, including those                                                                        
 interred outside of formal cemeteries?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
buildings on the campus date from the 1970s through the 2000s. According to the Northwest Information
Center (NWIC), there is a high potential for identifying unrecorded Native American resources and
historic-period archaeological resources on or near the EVC campus (NWIC 2011). Construction of
individual buildings and facilities would include site grading and excavation, and thus could uncover
unknown resources.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Under CEQA, "historic resources" means historic buildings or features or historic or prehistoric
archaeological deposits that qualify for inclusion on the California Register of Historic Resources based
on their historical or prehistoric significance. Several buildings on the campus are identified in the 2025
FMP for demolition. These include the Cluster Acacia, Cluster Roble, Racquetball courts, and all portable
buildings. The Cluster Acacia, Cluster Roble, and Racquetball courts were built in the 1970s. The portable
buildings were constructed in the 2000s. Due to their age, none of these structures appears to be
potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or the California Register of
Historic Resources. Thus, the implementation of the 2025 FMP will have no impact on significant historic
resources.

b) The NWIC was contacted to conduct an archaeological records search for the campus and surrounding
area. The NWIC indicated that there is a high potential of identifying unrecorded Native American
resources on or near the EVC campus because the campus is located at a valley/foothill interface and is
bounded by Yerba Buena creek to the south and because multiple Native American archaeological
resources, including burials, have been found in the vicinity of the campus. In addition, there is a high
potential of identifying unrecorded historic-period archaeological resources on or near the campus as a


Impact Sciences, Inc.                                  27                     Evergreen Valley College 2025 Facilities Master Plan
0461.004                                                                                                                July 2012
review of older maps (1942 San José 15-minute topographic quadrangle and 1876 Historical Atlas of Santa
Clara County) depict buildings within the project area (NWIC 2011). Any inadvertent damage to
significant Native American and historic-period archaeological resources represents a potentially
significant impact. The EIR will analyze the potential impacts related to Native American and historic-
period archaeological resources on campus.

c) While the majority of campus is situated on alluvial fan sediments, sandstone and shale bedrock has
been encountered on campus. The presence of bedrock suggests that the presence of unique
paleontological resources on campus is possible (SJECCD 2000). As a result, there is a possibility that
paleontological resources may exist at deep levels, and disturbance of such resources would result in a
potentially significant impact. However, implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-3 would reduce
impacts to a less than significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure CUL-3: If known, suspected, or potential vertebrate fossil materials are
                   discovered during construction, work will stop within a 75-foot radius of the find until a
                   qualified professional paleontologist (as defined by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology or
                   consistent with Caltrans standards for a Supervising Paleontologist) can assess the nature
                   and importance of the find and recommend appropriate treatment, if any. Based on the
                   paleontologist's professional judgment, treatment may include preparation and recovery of
                   fossil materials so that they can be housed in an appropriate museum or university collection,
                   and may also include preparation of a report for publication describing the finds. The
                   campus will be responsible for ensuring that the paleontologist's recommendations
                   regarding treatment and reporting are implemented.

d) See the responses to Items 5(a) and (b), above. Multiple Native American archaeological resources,
including burials, have been found in the vicinity of the campus. It is therefore possible that human
remains of Native American origin could be present on the campus. Any disturbance of human remains
would represent a potentially significant impact. However, with implementation of Mitigation Measure
CUL-4, which outlines procedures to be followed in the event that previously unknown human remains
are discovered, any impacts would be reduced to a less than significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure CUL-4: In the event of a discovery of human bone, potential human
                   bone, or a known or potential human burial, all ground-disturbing work in the vicinity of the
                   find will halt immediately and the area of the find will be protected until a qualified
                   archaeologist determines whether the bone is human. If the qualified archaeologist
                   determines the bone is human, the Campus will notify the County Coroner of the find.
                   Consistent with California Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5(b), which prohibits
                   disturbance of human remains uncovered by excavation until the Coroner has made a
                   finding relative to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 5097, the Campus will
                   ensure that the remains and vicinity of the find are protected against further disturbance.

                   If it is determined that the find is of Native American origin, the Campus will comply with
                   the provisions of Public Resources Code Section 5097.98 regarding identification and
                   involvement of the Most Likely Descendant (MLD).

                   If the human remains cannot be protected in place following the Coroner's determination, the
                   Campus shall ensure that the qualified archaeologist and the MLD are provided the
                   opportunity to confer on repatriation and/or archaeological treatment of human remains, and

                   that any appropriate studies, as identified through this consultation, are carried out prior to
                   reinterment. The Campus shall provide results of all such studies to the Native American
                   community, and shall provide an opportunity for Native American involvement in any
                   interpretative reporting. As stipulated by the provisions of the California Native American
                   Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Campus shall ensure that human remains and
                   associated artifacts recovered from campus projects on state lands are repatriated to the
                   appropriate local tribal group if requested.

Anticipated future development in some portions of San José has the potential to adversely affect cultural
resources in the City. However, with mitigation, future development on the campus under the 2025 FMP
would have no project-level impacts on cultural resources. Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP
would not make a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact on cultural resources
that could result from other development in the City.

 for the disposal of waste water?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
topography of the campus is relatively flat but is surrounded by hillside areas. The eastern portion of
campus is traversed by the Evergreen fault.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a)(i) An Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone1 associated with the Evergreen fault passes through the
eastern portion of the campus (CGS 2011), and this fault is considered active (URS 2011). However, no
new development associated with the 2025 FMP would occur within the earthquake fault zone, and the
Roble and Acacia cluster buildings that currently lie partly within this zone would be demolished. As a
result, future development on the campus would not expose structures and people to hazards associated
with the rupture of a known earthquake fault. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

a)(ii) The campus could be subject to strong ground shaking in the event of an earthquake originating
along active portions of the Evergreen fault or numerous other faults listed as active or potentially active
in the Bay Area. Development of new buildings and facilities under the 2025 FMP thus could pose a risk
to public safety and property by exposing people, property, or infrastructure to potentially adverse
effects, including strong seismic ground shaking. This impact is considered potentially significant. The
EIR will identify and characterize potential impacts related to strong seismic ground shaking.

a)(iii) The campus is not located in a liquefaction hazard zone designated by the State of California
pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (CGS 2001). As a result, future development on the
campus would not expose structures and people to hazards associated with seismic-related ground
failure, including liquefaction. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

a)(iv) The hills in the northern portion of campus are considered to be susceptible to earthquake-induced
landslides by the State of California pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (CGS 2001).
Although no development is planned in the more steeply sloped hillside areas of campus, future
development adjacent to these slopes could expose structures and people to hazards associated with
landslides. This impact is considered potentially significant. The EIR will identify and characterize
potential impacts related to landslides originating from the surrounding hillside areas.

b) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would require activities such as vegetation
removal and grading that would expose soil to erosion. For projects that would disturb 1 acre or more,
coverage under the state National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for
Discharges of Storm Water Associated with Construction Activity would be required prior to
construction and the construction contractor would be required to file a notice of intent (NOI) with the
State Water Resources Control Board and develop and implement a site-specific Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that specifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control on-site erosion and
off-site sedimentation, and to keep construction pollutants from coming into contact with storm water.
The campus would have oversight responsibility and would have the authority to shut down
construction in the event the SWPPP is improperly implemented. For projects that would disturb less
than 1 acre, the campus would develop an erosion control plan which would include sediment and
erosion controls to limit on-site erosion and off-site sedimentation, and to keep construction pollutants
from coming into contact with storm water. With these measures in place, impacts related to accelerated
erosion and sedimentation are expected to be less than significant.

c) Weak soil layers and lenses occur at random locations and depths beneath the campus (SJECCD 2001).
Therefore, future development on the campus could be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable,
or that would become unstable as a result of development. Issues related to seismically induced and non-


1     Prior to 1994, Earthquake Fault Zones were called Special Studies Zones.

seismic landslide hazards are discussed in response to Item (a)(iv), above, and as noted there, will be
addressed in the EIR. Issues related to liquefaction and related hazards are discussed in response to Item
(a)(iii), above, and as noted the impacts would be less than significant. Issues related to soil properties are
discussed in response to Item (d) below, and the impact would be less than significant. Construction of
facilities identified in the 2025 FMP may require the creation of cut or fill slopes, which could be unstable
if they are improperly designed or constructed. However, development would be designed and
constructed in accordance with the current CBC, which includes provisions that specifically address good
grading practices and cut and fill slope stability. Impacts related to unstable cut or fill slopes are therefore
expected to be less than significant.

d) The expansive potential for soils on the eastern portion of campus could cause damage to buildings,
building foundations, roads, and other structures (SJECCD 2001). The properties of native materials that
underlie individual development sites on the campus at depth would be evaluated during the
development of the site-specific geotechnical investigations that the campus will prepare for the project
design of each new facility identified by the 2025 FMP. As discussed above, all facilities identified in the
2025 FMP will adhere to the current CBC, which includes detailed provisions to ensure that the design of
new facilities is appropriate to site soil conditions, including requirements to address expansive and
otherwise problematic soils. With adherence to the CBC, impacts related to site soil conditions--
including but not limited to expansive soils, if any are present--would be less than significant.

e) Future development on the campus under the 2025 FMP would not involve the installation of septic
tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative
impacts with regard to geology and soils. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

7. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ­ Would the
project:

a) Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or
indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the

reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a-b) Construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections
on the campus would generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This represents a potentially significant
impact. The EIR will estimate the direct and indirect GHG emissions from the operation of facilities
identified in the 2025 FMP and discuss whether the emissions would exceed the BAAQMD's
recommended thresholds for evaluation of GHG impacts. The EIR will also estimate and report GHG
emissions that would be generated during construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The contribution of the 2025 FMP to the global cumulative impact will be addressed in the EIR.

 8. HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
 ­ Would the project:

 a) Create a significant hazard to the public or the
 environment through the routine transport, use, or                                                                   
 disposal of hazardous materials?

 b) Create a significant hazard to the public or the
 environment through reasonably foreseeable
 upset and accident conditions involving the                                                                          
 release of hazardous materials into the
 environment?

 c) Emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous
 or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or                                                                       
 waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or
 proposed school?

 d) Be located on a site which is included on a list
 of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to
 Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result,                                                                    
 would it create a significant hazard to the public
 or the environment?

 e) For a project located within an airport land use
 plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted,
 within 2 miles of a public airport or public use                                                                     
 airport, would the project result in a safety hazard
 for people residing or working in the project area?

 f) For a project within the vicinity of a private
 airstrip, would the project result in a safety hazard                                                                
 for people residing or working in the project area?

 g) Impair implementation of or physically

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus. The
campus contains several older buildings that are identified for demolition in the 2025 FMP. The closest
schools are Matsumoto Elementary School and Chaboya Middle School, both of which are located
approximately 0.5 mile to the north of the campus, and Laurelwood Elementary School, which is located
about 0.5 mile to the west of the campus. The nearest airport is Reid-Hillview Airport, located
approximately 4 miles to the northwest of the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Although the construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would use small quantities of
hazardous materials on each construction site, compliance with local, state, and federal regulations would
minimize risks associated with the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials during
construction. Any hazardous materials utilized during the operation of facilities identified in the 2025
FMP would be limited to those typically used in academic support and standard maintenance activities
(e.g., laboratory chemicals, photoprocessing chemicals, solvents, fuels, oils, paints, cleaning agents or
pesticides). The use of all hazardous materials during operation would be required to comply with
stringent local, state, and federal regulations on hazardous materials use. Given the types and small
quantities of hazardous materials that would be used, as well as stringent regulations, the impacts related
to the routine transport, use, and disposal of hazardous materials would be less than significant.

b) See response to Item (a) above. Based on their age, buildings to be demolished as part of the 2025 FMP
could contain asbestos, lead, and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). State law requires that contractors
and workers be notified of the presence of asbestos in buildings constructed before 1979. The California
Department of Public Health requires the certification of employees and supervisors performing lead-
related construction activities in residential and public buildings. Standard specifications included in all
campus construction contracts specify that contractors who disturb or potentially disturb asbestos or lead
must comply with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding these materials. Contractors
are also required to stop work and inform the Campus if they encounter material believed to be asbestos,
PCBs, lead, or other hazardous materials. Compliance with federal, state, and local regulations and
campus procedures would minimize possible exposure to campus employees and students. Therefore,
this impact would be less than significant.

c) See the responses to Items 8(a) and 8(b) above. The campus is not located within 0.25 mile of a school.
There would be no impact with respect to this criterion.

d) The EVC campus is not included on a list of hazardous materials sites subject to corrective action
compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 (Cortese List). However, as shown in an EDR
report that was prepared for the campus, the campus is included on a number of federal, state, and local
databases. The inclusion of the campus in these databases stems from hazardous waste related to
academic uses and the presence of under and above ground fuel storage tanks on the campus. The
generation of hazardous waste at the EVC campus is related to academic and facilities maintenance uses
and may include laboratory chemicals, photoprocessing chemicals, solvents, fuels, oils, paints, cleaning
agents or pesticides that are currently used in laboratory research, building and grounds maintenance,
vehicle maintenance, and fine arts. In addition, hazard materials associated with electrical transmission
are also located on campus.

Based on the EDR report, there is currently no known contamination on the project site. The EDR report
indicated that several sites with known or potential contamination, hazardous materials use, hazardous
waste generation, or other hazardous-materials-related conditions are within 1 mile of the campus (EDR
2011). Known or potentially contaminated sites near the campus include the church property south of the
campus on Yerba Buena Road and the shopping center located at the corner of San Felipe Road and Yerba
Buena Road. The sources of contamination on these sites include miscellaneous chemicals associated with
cellular equipment on the church property, miscellaneous chemicals, and photochemical waste associated
with retail uses in the shopping center, and auto wrecking facilities located in the shopping center. Other
potential sources of contamination in the vicinity of the project site include hydrocarbons from leaking
underground storage tanks, chemical use and waste, and the presence of chemicals in the soil due to past
agricultural use in the area (EDR 2011). Because of the site status and orientation relative to groundwater
flow direction for the identified sites, it is unlikely that groundwater contamination from these sites may
have migrated to the campus (EDR 2011). However, given the uncertainty of contamination on the project
site from sources off site, this assessment conservatively assumes that contamination could be present
and, if encountered during construction, could result in the exposure of the public or construction
workers to hazardous materials. This is considered a potentially significant impact. However, with the
implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, which requires an assessment and cleanup of potential
contamination that may be encountered during construction, this impact would be reduced to a less than
significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure HAZ-1: If evidence of contaminated soil and/or groundwater, such as
                   discolored soil, odors or oil sheen, is encountered during the removal of on-site debris or
                   during excavation and/or grading both on and off site, the construction contractors shall stop
                   work and immediately inform the Campus. An environmental hazardous materials
                   professional shall be contracted to conduct an on-site assessment. If the materials are
                   determined to pose a risk to the public or construction workers, the construction contractor
                   shall prepare and submit a remediation plan to the appropriate agency and comply with all
                   federal, state, and local laws. Soil remediation methods could include excavation and on-site
                   treatment, excavation and off-site treatment or disposal, and/or treatment without
                   excavation. Remediation alternatives for cleanup of contaminated groundwater could
                   include in-situ treatment, extraction and on-site treatment, or extraction and off-site
                   treatment and/or disposal. Construction plans shall be modified or construction postponed to
                   ensure that construction will not inhibit remediation activities and will not expose the public
                   or construction workers to hazardous conditions.

e) The campus is not located within the immediate vicinity of the Reid-Hillview Airport. Given the
distance of the campus from the airport, future development under the 2025 FMP would not place
persons within an airport hazard zone. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

f) The campus is not located in the vicinity of a private airstrip, and there would be no impact with regard
to this criterion.

g) The City of San José Emergency Operations Plan does not list Yerba Buena Road or San Felipe Road as
emergency evacuation routes (City of San José 2004). In addition, construction of facilities identified in
the 2025 FMP would occur within the boundaries of the campus, and thus would not impede traffic on
roadways surrounding campus. In addition, the Campus would keep all campus roadways open during
construction so that emergency response and evacuation is not affected. There would be no impact with
regard to this criterion.

h) The EVC campus is not located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, as designated by maps
prepared by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire 2008). There would be no
impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José has the potential to expose the public and the environment to
risks associated with hazards from on-site contamination and routine use of hazardous materials.
However, with mitigation, future development under the 2025 FMP would not expose the public and the
environment to potential on-site contamination during construction. In addition, while the operation of
campus facilities would involve the routine use of hazardous materials in small amounts, the use of these
materials on campus would comply with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations. Therefore, the
proposed project would not contribute to a cumulative impact during operation.

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on the campus.
Construction of individual buildings and facilities would include site grading and excavation. All runoff
from pavements, roofs, and other impervious surfaces that are developed on campus flows and would
continue to flow to Thompson Creek, which is located to the west of the campus across San Felipe Road.
The campus is underlain by the Santa Clara groundwater basin (DWR 2003). The campus is not located
within a 100-year flood plain or a flood inundation zone (FEMA 2009). The nearest body of water is the
Cherry Flat Reservoir, located 4 miles northeast of the campus. The San Francisco Bay is located about
19 miles northwest of the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) During construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP, there is a potential for increased erosion,
sedimentation, and discharge of polluted runoff from the site. However, as identified in Geology and
Soils Item 6(b), the construction contractor would be required to implement a SWPPP including erosion
and pollution control measures in compliance with NPDES regulations, or implement an erosion control
plan as required by campus procedures to control increases in off-site sediment delivery. The impact to
water quality from construction activities would therefore be less than significant.

The development of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would increase the amount of impervious
surfaces on the campus and would increase the amount of runoff generated on the campus. During
operation, all site drainage would be routed to the City's storm drain system, which would then
discharge the flow to Thompson Creek. This runoff is subject to the conditions of the Municipal Regional
Stormwater NPDES Permit No. CAS612008 for the San Francisco Bay Region. This permit requires
permittees to comply with the discharge prohibitions and receiving water limitations through the timely
implementation of control measures and other actions as specified in the permit (San Francisco Bay
RWQCB, 2009). Future development on the campus would be required to comply with applicable NPDES
requirements for stormwater quality. Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP would not result in any
direct or indirect discharges that would violate water quality standards or waste discharge requirements.
Impacts during operation would be less than significant with regard to this criterion.

b) The campus is underlain by the Santa Clara groundwater basin. However, the campus obtains its
potable water supply from surface water supplies provided through the local water retailer. Therefore,
the increase in potable water use on the campus from implementation of the 2025 FMP would not impact
groundwater supplies. Natural recharge in the basin occurs principally as infiltration in streambeds that
exit the upland areas within the drainage basin and from direct percolation of precipitation that falls on

0461.004                                                                                                                  July 2012
the basin floor (DWR 2003). Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase the amount of impervious
surface on the campus. However, as this increase in impervious surface would be small, it would have a
minimal effect on groundwater recharge. Impacts would be less than significant with regard to this
criterion.

c) While the erosion potential of a majority of soils on the campus is none to slight, the erosion potential
of soils on the northeastern portion of the campus is medium to high (SJECCD 2001). Storm water
generated by future development under the 2025 FMP would be directed toward existing storm drainage
facilities serving the campus. As discussed in Geology and Soils Item 6(b) above, each individual project
on the campus would be required to control soil erosion and siltation during construction through either
the preparation of a SWPPP if the project is 1 acre or more in size or the preparation of an erosion control
plan if the project is less than 1 acre in size. Implementation of the SWPPP would reduce the potential for
erosion on the construction sites and minimize the discharge of sediment into the storm drain system.
Once the new or replacement facilities are constructed, the project sites would be either under impervious
surfaces (buildings, pavement, etc.) or would be landscaped. This would minimize the potential for
erosion and sedimentation in the long run. In addition, while the implementation of the 2025 FMP would
increase the amount of impervious surface on the campus, this increase in impervious surface would be
small. As a result, the amount of additional runoff entering the City's storm drain system would not be
substantial enough to result in off-site erosion or siltation in downstream locations. Therefore, this impact
is considered less than significant.

d) As discussed in the previous response above, storm water generated by future development under the
2025 FMP would be directed toward existing storm drainage facilities serving the campus. There are no
existing flooding problems on the campus, and each project built on the campus would be designed to
avoid on-site flooding. In addition, while the implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase the amount
of impervious surface on the campus, this increase in impervious surface would be small. However, the
amount of additional runoff entering the City's storm drain system could be substantial enough to
contribute to existing flooding problems along Thompson Creek (SJECCD 2001). This represents a
potentially significant impact. The EIR will analyze the potential impacts related to flooding on or near
the campus.

e) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase impervious surfaces on campus, which could increase
the volume of stormwater runoff in the City's storm drain system. Although this increase in runoff would
be small, it could exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage systems because of lack
of capacity in Thompson Creek to accept stormwater runoff during flood conditions. This represents a
potentially significant impact. The EIR will analyze the potential impacts related to stormwater system
capacity.

See response to Item 9(a) above with regard to water quality. Implementation of the 2025 FMP would not
provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff. Therefore, this impact is considered less than
significant.

f) See responses to Items 9(a) through (d), above, and related discussions in the Hazards and Hazardous
Materials Section of this checklist. No other potential project impacts to water quality were identified.

g-h) The campus is not located within a 100-year flood zone. The campus is located within Flood Zone D,
which is defined as an area with undetermined flooding, but where flooding is possible (FEMA 2009).
There are no existing residential uses on campus and no residential uses are included in the 2025 FMP. As

a result, implementation of the 2025 FMP would not place housing or structures within an area at risk of
flood flows. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

i) The campus is not located within the dam inundation area for the Cherry Flats Reservoir (ABAG 1995).
Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP would not expose people or structures to a significant risk of
loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam.
There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

j) The campus is located well inland from the San Francisco Bay and no bodies of water are located in the
vicinity of the campus. As a result, the campus is not at risk of seiche or tsunami inundation. Because of
the location of the campus in flat topography there is no substantial risk of debris flow or mudflow. There
would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José could result in the violation of water quality or waste
discharge requirements during construction. However, construction projects in the City involving 1 acre
or more of land disturbance are required to prepare and implement a SWPPP that includes erosion and
pollution control measures and measures to control increases in off-site sediment delivery. Furthermore,
construction projects on the campus would be required to adhere to NPDES requirements for
construction activities. As a result, the cumulative impact with regard to water quality would be less than
significant.

The construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth could result in or contribute to
flooding problems along local creeks. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

Anticipated future development in San José could place housing or structures within a 100-year flood
zone or within a tsunami inundation area. However, as the campus is not located within either a 100-year
flood zone or within a tsunami inundation area, future development anticipated under the 2025 FMP
would not contribute to this impact.

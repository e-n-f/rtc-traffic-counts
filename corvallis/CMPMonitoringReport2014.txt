Subject:         2014 Campus Master Plan Monitoring Report


Oregon State University is pleased to provide the 2014 Campus Master Plan Monitoring Report
which is organized around the requirements outlined in the city’s Land Development Code Section
3.36.90. The purpose of the report is to provide information about OSU’s development activities
over the past calendar year. OSU is confident that the data provided in the 2014 annual report
complies with the monitoring requirements outlined in the City’s Code, and we are pleased to
inform you that OSU is well within the development paramaters established for the OSU Zone.

The first monitoring report was submitted for calendar year 2006, and annual reports were
consistently submitted each year through 2010. During the Corvallis / OSU Collaboration effort,
reports were not submitted for calendar years 2011-2013, however, individual studies, reports,
and sector development tracking documents were submitted under separate cover. Specifically,
Parking Utilization Studies were submitted for 2011, 2012, and 2013; Base Transportation Model
updates were submitted for 2012 and 2013; and Sector Development Tracking reports (which
include open space) were submitted as part of historic preservation permit and building permit
applications.

Overview
Oregon State University (OSU) is responsible for the completion of an annual Campus Master Plan (CMP)
Monitoring Report. The details included in the 2014-2015 CMP Monitoring Report are identified in
Section 3.36.90 of the city of Corvallis Land Development Code (LDC). The report follows the same order
as LDC Section 3.36.90 and explains how OSU has developed consistent with the Campus Master Plan
for the past calendar year.



Compliance
In the following section, the CMP Monitoring Report will demonstrate OSU’s compliance with the
requirements of LDC Section 3.36.90. LDC sections are shown in bold, italic text. Supporting documents
have been included as appendices.

Development

LDC Section 3.36.90.a.1.a - Gross square footage of development by type that occurred in each
Sector over the previous 12 month period
OSU tracks the university’s development with a database for the preparation of Campus Sector
Development Tracking Reports (Appendix A). The most recent report reveals that the majority of
development in 2014 occurred in Sector C. Four (4) buildings were demolished in the OSU shops area
for the 15th Street/Washington Way intersection improvement, while new construction projects
included Johnson Hall and the MU Plaza canopy. The Johnson Hall project is included in the 2014 GSF
calculation as a Sector Development Tracking Report was submitted as part of Corvallis’ Historic
Preservation Permit and building permit review processes.

LDC Section 3.36.90.a.1.b - Remaining available Development Allocation for each Sector
The Campus Sector Development Tracking Report, dated January 13, 2015, (Appendix A) shows that all
campus sectors are still within their allowable development allocation; refer to LDC Table 3.36-2:
Building Square Footage by Sector for permitted development. Campus sectors C and D have the lowest
available remaining development allocation while sectors A and J have the highest remaining
development allocation. Percent Remaining Developable amounts exceeding 100 percent are due to
the      removal     of     buildings     without     subsequent     replacement      development.

Parking Utilization Reports

LDC Section 3.36.90.a.2.a - Identification of new parking space creation and the total number of
spaces provided within the CMP boundary and a breakdown by Sector and parking lot type -
student, staff, visitor, free, etc.
There are 8,544 parking spaces on OSU’s campus. This number includes parking spaces in OSU General
Use lots, Non-Public lots, Non-OSU lots, and Residence Hall lots. OSU General Use lots provide parking
to the general public. Non-public lots are lots in which access is restricted or limited to a specific
university group. Non-OSU lots are parking areas located within main campus that are utilized by an
entity other than OSU typically through a lease agreement (e.g. EPA, the GEM, and Hilton Garden Inn).
Residence Hall lots provide parking exclusively to students living in on-campus housing.

OSU conducts an annual parking utilization study to report parking capacity and utilization for OSU
General Use lots and Residence Hall lots. The OSU Parking Utilization Study 2014-2015 reveals the
overall parking capacity of OSU General Use parking spaces on campus to be 5,759 parking spaces.
General Use parking spaces are available to the general public commuting daily to campus to visit, work,
or attend classes on campus. General Use parking space types include: Commuter, ADA, ADA Van, ADA
Wheelchair, Carpool, Electric Vehicle, Free, Metered, OAAEO (Office of Affirmative Action and Equal
Opportunity reserved spaces), Reserved, Short Term, Visitor and Motorcycle. Parking capacity of
Residence Hall Spaces, which are available only to students living on campus, is 1,081 spaces. This
represents a slight decrease in General Use parking capacity from previous years. A detailed discussion
of parking capacity and parking lot changes by lot and sector is contained within the OSU Parking
Utilization Study 2014-2015 (Appendix B).

Note: ADA and Other counts were aggregated for academic years through 2010 - 2011
*   Prior to the 2011-2012 count, this category included "university support" spaces which are not open to the general public.
** Prior to the 2014-2015 report and the creation of the Residence Hall space type, 88 spaces at Orchard Court were
    considered Non-Public, and not included in the Parking Utilization Study. In this table, these spaces are labeled as Existing
    Residence Hall Spaces because they provided residential parking in the same manner as the new Residence Hall Space
    type.
^   Adjusted General Use Spaces reflects the corrected capacity of OSU General Use Lots; 454 spaces in Non-OSU and Non-
    Public lots and 164 Service spaces were removed from the OSU General Use capacity as part of the methodology
    refinement completed as part of the OSU Parking Utilization Study 2011-2012.
^^ The OSU Parking Utilization Study 2011-2012 was conducted during Spring Term 2012.
^^^ Space types were reclassified in 2014-2015 academic year as part of the zonal parking system.
†   Student and Staff space types were combined into a single "Commuter" space type as part of the zonal parking system
    implementation for academic year 2014-2015.

LDC Section 3.36.90.a.2.b - Percentage of parking space utilization campus-wide
OSU’s campus-wide parking utilization rate for OSU General Use spaces for Fall Term 2014 was seventy-
three percent (73%) during the peak hours between 10 am and 2 pm. This represents a slight decrease
in utilization over the previous year. Parking utilization for Residence Hall spaces during the same
period was eighty percent (80%). When parking utilization was calculated for OSU General Use and
Residence Hall spaces combined together, the utilization rate was seventy-four percent (74%). The
utilization rate for all space types and all parking lot types (including Non-Public and Non-OSU) was
seventy-one percent (71%) over the same period. A detailed discussion of parking utilization for OSU
General Use and Residence Hall spaces can be found in the OSU Parking Utilization Study 2014-2015

*Parking spaces based on City of Corvallis Land Development Code regulations

In 2012, as part of the city of Corvallis / OSU Collaboration effort, OSU and the city retained Group
McKenzie to conduct a Neighborhood Parking and Traffic Mitigation Analysis focusing on the residential
neighborhoods surrounding OSU. The study area extended north to Grant Avenue, west to 36th Street,
east to 4th Street, and south to Philomath Boulevard. The findings resulted in a recommendation to the
form additional parking districts. The parking districts were approved by City Council; however, the
change was turned-down by a public vote in 2014.

LDC Section 3.36.90.a.3.a - Shuttle routes and usage
OSU’s fareless shuttle service, the Beaver Bus, was expanded in 2014 to offer more routes and increase
hours of operation. Four (4) shuttles serve three fixed routes designed to complement the new zonal
parking system. The Beaver Bus operates from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. during thirty-three (33) weeks of the
school year and on limited routes the rest of the year. The Beaver Bus can be tracked online as well as
through mobile apps to inform riders of shuttle bus locations. Due to various improvements in the
operation of the Beaver Bus, ridership increased in 2014.

LDC Section 3.36.90.a.3.b - Other efforts in support of transit, car-pool or vanpool usage
OSU Contributes to four (4) separate transit systems serving the OSU campus: Beaver Bus, Corvallis
Transit System (CTS), the Philomath Connection, and the Linn-Benton Loop. In addition to the Beaver
Bus (refer to LDC Section 3.36.90.a.3.a - for information on the Beaver Bus), OSU contributes
approximately $300,000 to CTS for operations through a combination of funding sources. Additionally,
OSU general funds provide an additional $106,600 for service by the Linn-Benton Loop and $1,970 for
the Philomath Connection. OSU student fees contribute and additional $8,879 for the Philomath
Connection.

OSU also encourages Rideshare through carshare, vanpool, and carpool. Three percent (3%) of students
and seven percent (7%) of employees commute to campus using ridesharing. OSU partners with
Enterprise Rent a Car to provide a car share service as an alternative to owning a car. There are three
(3) carshare vehicles on the OSU campus. OSU also offers reduced cost parking permits for carpooling
and vanpooling commuters.


LDC Section 3.36.90.a.3.c - Tabulation of the number of single-occupancy vehicles reduced
While this metric is difficult to definitively measure, the closest measurement is the change in the
Parking Utilization Study’s data on the number of occupied spaces on campus. The data for these
studies is collected at the same time each year during the fourth week of the fall academic term, which
is typically the point in an academic year when a university is at its peak enrollment. A comparison of
the occupied spaces for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 academic years reveals a reduction from 5,226 to
5,055 spaces, which is a reduction in 171 vehicles on campus (refer to Table 12a: OSU Parking Utilization
on page 15 of Appendix B). The reduction in vehicles on campus is consistent with the lower traffic
volumes found in the results of the Base Transportation Model Update: 2014-2015. A comparison of
2013 and 2014 tube count data collected at twenty-eight (28) intersections on and around campus
reveals generally similar profiles and magnitude, but it clearly shows a reduction in traffic volume during

10 of Appendix D).


LDC Section 3.36.90.a.3.d - Location and number of bicycle parking spaces, including the
number of covered spaces and any additions to the inventory
OSU supports bicycling through ongoing bicycle facilities development, a bike loan program, and repair
and maintenance facilities at Dixon Recreation Center. Bicycling is the primary mode of commuting to
campus for thirty-two percent (32%) of students and sixteen percent (16%) of employees. OSU requires
bike lanes on collector roadways within the campus, while the Pedestrian Core and Sports Complex
classifications may have bike lanes, shared lane markings (sharrows), or shared lanes (without
markings).

OSU conducts a Bicycle Utilization Survey every two years. The 2014 survey was conducted in October;
however, data from that survey is not yet available. The most recent available bicycle utilization data is
from the 2012 Bicycle Utilization Survey. At the time of the 2012 survey, OSU had 7,491 bicycle parking
spaces: 2,326 spaces (31%) were covered and 5,169 spaces (69%) were uncovered (Appendix E). Since
the 2012 bicycle parking survey over 330 bicycle parking spaces have been added to the university’s
inventory. These spaces were added through the construction of new buildings (Appendix F).


LDC Section 3.36.90.a.3.e - Identification of campus pedestrian routes and system
improvements
In 2014, OSU installed 4,204 linear feet of new pedestrian improvements and replaced and/or
reconstructed an additional 7,452 linear feet of pedestrian improvements. The 11,656 linear feet were
part of projects including, but not limited to, Austin Hall, Centro Cultural Cesar Chavez, McNary Dining
Center, Samaritan Sports Medicine Center, and Tebeau Hall.


Base Transportation Model

LDC Section 3.36.90.a.4 - Base Transportation Model (BTM) update that includes the following
components over the previous 12 month period
In the summer of 2013, OSU staff met with city of Corvallis Planning and Engineering staff to discuss
concerns regarding consistency and accuracy of the adopted Base Transportation Model (BTM) and an
alternative approach to assessing the impacts of vehicles on campus. OSU and city staff found the
model had become less reliable over time and recognized the need to accurately evaluate the impacts of
vehicle trips at the intersections within campus and at the campus/city boundaries. OSU was committed
to fulfilling its obligations to the city of Corvallis in a way that would be valuable to both the university
and the city. OSU and city staff agreed that OSU would conduct vehicle Average Daily Trip (ADT) counts
at the twenty-eight (28) intersections on and around campus which had been previously assessed as
part of the BTM (refer to Table 1 – of Appendix D). OSU agreed to submit this count information, along
with a summary analysis of changes in intersection counts compared with the 2010 counts, in lieu of
updating the BTM.


LDC Section 3.36.90.a.4.a - Traffic counts to be updated on a five-year cycle


February 4, 2015                                                                                          8
Campus Planning and Development                                         CMP MONITORING REPORT 2014

Consistent with the agreement reached in summer 2013, OSU conducted traffic counts at the twenty-
eight (28) intersections identified in Figure 1: Roadway Functional Classification and Vehicle Operations
Study Intersections of the 2014-2015 BTM Report (refer to page 4 of Appendix D). This year’s
assessment revealed that four (4) intersections did not meet standards (refer to Table 2: Intersections
not meeting standards under 2014-2015 conditions on page 16), which is an improvement over the
2013-2014 assessment which revealed seven (7) intersections did not meet operational standards
during peak periods. The intersection of 26th Street and US 20/OR 34 previously met standards in the
2013-2014 assessment but does not in the 2014-2015 analysis, primarily due to increased traffic
demands in both directions on the highway.

Three of the four intersections not meeting standards in 2014-2015 appear to have several options that
include doing nothing, with limited impact to transportation users. These intersections include 30th
Street & Harrison Boulevard, 25th Street/Park Terrace-Monroe Avenue, and 30th Street & Western
Boulevard. These intersections are all two-way stop controlled. There are alternative routes for
vehicles using the side-street approaches. Volumes on the side-street approaches experiencing the
highest delay are generally low, with the exception of the intersection of 30th Street and Western
Boulevard, where a relatively high number of left-turning vehicles experience delay on the stop-
controlled southbound approach. An exclusive right-turn lane was added in fall 2014 to the southbound
approach at this intersection, bringing it nearly up to standards. These three intersections are designed
to prioritize mobility on the higher order roadway, so changing the traffic control would introduce delay
for the higher volume roadway. Therefore, given the presence of alternative routes, lower-volumes on
the side-streets, and priority of mobility on the main streets, it may be most beneficial to the community
to make no changes at these locations. Much larger delays and higher vehicle emissions would be
avoided by taking limited or no action at this time.

Finally, the intersection of 26th Street and US 20/OR 34 may warrant further monitoring or assessment
(possibly on a biennial basis) to determine whether or not an improvement is feasible and practical. It
will be important for OSU to coordinate with the city and ODOT, particularly during long-range planning
efforts, to ensure that appropriate solutions are found and that partners contribute proportionally to
their impacts. For a detailed analysis of potential actions and trade-offs for each of the four
intersections, refer to Pages 21-29 Appendix D.


LDC Section 3.36.90.a.4.b - New development, and if known, future development square footage
and Use Type, based on the existing model’s categories, to be included in the model assumptions
on a per Sector basis
Consistent with the agreement reached in summer 2013, OSU has conducted traffic counts in lieu of a
BTM update. At the time of drafting this report, future development includes Johnson Hall and the Goss
Stadium expansion. Both of these projects are consistent with the sector development and open space
requirements identified in the Campus Master Plan.


LDC Section 3.36.90.a.4.c - New parking areas or roadways that may have an effect on traffic
volumes or patterns
In summer 2014, OSU improved the intersection of 15th Street and Washington Way. This project was
done at the same time the city was repaving 15th Street. OSU’s project included realignment of the
intersection, improvement of the at-grade railroad crossing, and the addition of a signal, turn lanes, bike
lanes, city-standard landscape strips, and separated sidewalks.

Additionally last summer, OSU added a designated, right-turn lane on the southbound approach to the
30th Street and Western Boulevard intersection.


LDC Section 3.36.90.a.4.d - Within one year of adoption of the CMP, and on a recurrent two-year
schedule, OSU shall complete in coordination with City Staff a baseline traffic count for Jackson
                                   th
Avenue between Arnold Way and 35 Street. City staff shall provide OSU and the neighborhood
association with the most recent baseline traffic volume measurements made within the last five
years.
Baseline traffic counts for Jackson Avenue between Arnold Way and 35th Street were collected in
January 2007. More recently traffic counts along Jackson Avenue were collected over a two-day period
in April of 2014 by Quality Counts, an independent firm specializing in traffic counts (Appendix G). The
data collection was done in coordination with the city as part of the City /OSU collaboration effort. Eric
Adams, project manager for the City / OSU Collaboration project posted the traffic count results on the
Collaboration Corvallis website and sent an e-mail link to Gary Angelo, president of the College Hill
Neighborhood Association.


Additional Monitoring Efforts

LDC Section 3.36.90.b.1 Within one year of adoption of the CMP, OSU should work with the City
to perform a baseline traffic count of local streets identified by neighborhood associations as
problems in the areas bordering Sectors A, B, and C, and south of Harrison Boulevard; and
A baseline traffic count was not conducted within one year of adopting the CMP; however, in 2007, OSU
conducted a baseline traffic count for Jackson Avenue in the West College Hill Neighborhood.
Furthermore, neighborhood traffic counts were collected in April 2014 for local streets bordering
Sectors A, B, and C, and south of Harrison Boulevard (Appendix H). This data collection was done by
Quality Counts as part of the City/OSU collaboration effort and was posted on the Collaboration
Corvallis website.


LDC Section 3.36.90.b.2 - OSU shall participate as a full partner in a task force initiated by the
City with City, University, neighborhood association and neighborhood business representation,
to review and evaluate existing baseline traffic measurements, parking studies, and other relevant
information and develop strategies to mitigate problem areas.
This City-initiated task force was formed; however, it disbanded after several meetings. Additionally,
OSU assessed parking on neighborhood streets as part of the university’s 2007 and 2010 parking
utilization studies. Over the past three years, OSU worked with adjacent neighborhood residents and
business owners during the Corvallis / OSU Collaboration effort. Specifically, the Parking and Traffic
Work Group assessed neighborhood concerns and developed a series of recommendations, and a
number of those recommendations have been implemented. OSU is interested in working with the city
and neighbors on issues of mutual concern in the future.

Executive Summary
    OSU’s campus-wide parking utilization rate for OSU General Use spaces for Fall Term 2014 was
     seventy-three percent (73%) during the peak hours between 10 am and 2 pm. This utilization rate
     does not include Residence Hall spaces.
    When the utilization rate is calculated including both OSU General Use and Residence Hall space
     types, OSU’s campus-wide parking utilization rate for Fall Term 2014 was seventy-four percent
     (74%) during the peak hours between 10 am and 2pm.
    Utilization of OSU General Use (Commuter) parking lots varied from fifteen to 100 percent (15% -
     100%). Unlike previous years, utilization was typically higher for parking facilities that are more
     distant from the campus core, in parking permit zones B and C.
    Campus Sectors E, F, and H had the highest utilization with utilization rates between eighty-one and
     ninety-eight percent (81-98%). Sectors C and D experienced noticeable declines in utilization rates
     since the previous academic year, but Sectors F and H had significant utilization increases. The
     implementation of the zonal parking system beginning Fall Term 2014 appears to have created
     changes in preferred parking locations, which can be seen in the changes in sector utilization rates
     from the previous study year.
    Parking garage utilization rate declined from an eighty percent (80%) utilization rate for the 2013-
     2014 academic year to a seventy-four percent (74%) utilization rate for the 2014-2015 academic
     year.
    Forty-three percent (43%) of motorcycle areas were utilized during Fall Term 2014.
    OSU General Use spaces decreased from 6,991 to 5,759 between academic years 2013-2014 and
     2014-2015. This reduction was primarily due to the reclassification of 993 spaces from OSU General
     Use spaces (Student spaces) to Residence Hall spaces with the implementation of the zonal parking
     system. In previous years, Residence Hall parking spaces were captured within in the OSU General
     Use space type (Student spaces). When the change in parking capacity is calculated including OSU
     General Use spaces and Residence Hall spaces, parking capacity decreased only three percent (3%)
     over the last year from 6,991 spaces to 6,752 spaces.
    Since 2010, student enrollment has increased annually between one and eight percent (1%-8%),
     with a total increase of thirteen percent (13%). The number of employees also has increased by
     thirteen percent (13%) during the same time period. Consequently, the total population (students
     and employees) on OSU main campus has increased from approximately 27,000 in Fall Term 2010 to
     30,000 in Fall Term 2014.
    Twenty-two percent (22%) of OSU’s Total Campus population had purchased parking permits as of
     the initiation of this year’s parking utilization survey, October 21st, 2014. This is consistent with
     percentages from the last four survey years, during which the percent of OSU’s Total Campus
     population with a parking permit varied between twenty and twenty-three percent (20%-23%). As
     of October 21st, 2014, 6,814 Commuter permits were sold compared to 6,952 permits sold during
     the same period for the previous study year.

OSU Parking Utilization Study
Background
The OSU Parking Utilization Study is an analysis of the parking conditions for on-campus parking facilities
for the 2014-2015 academic year. The study is completed annually during Fall Term, when enrollment
and parking utilization are typically at their highest levels of an academic year. The annual utilization
study provides insight into parking utilization for that academic year.

The OSU Parking Utilization Study was developed to comply with policies outlined in the Oregon State
University Campus Master Plan2004-2015 (CMP) and to inform OSU’s parking management and
development strategies. The CMP contains policies that specify how OSU will address existing and future
parking demand. CMP Chapter 7 – Parking Plan requires the planning of new parking facilities if the
campus parking utilization rate reaches or exceeds eighty-five percent (85%). The intent of this policy is
to ensure that additional parking facilities would be ready for construction if parking usage was to
exceed ninety percent (90%) or at the time a new construction project is proposed (CMP 7.2.7). The
CMP further specifies that OSU will monitor parking usage rates at least once per year and provide
monitoring results to the City of Corvallis (CMP 7.2.10). The OSU Parking Utilization Study 2014-2015
fulfills these monitoring requirements for the 2014-2015 academic year. Additional monitoring efforts
are undertaken periodically and as needed by OSU’s Parking Services to further inform OSU’s parking
management efforts and are not captured in the OSU Parking Utilization Study.

Methodology
Methodology Changes Triggered by the Zonal Parking System
The methodology used for the OSU Parking Utilization Study 2014-2015 is largely the same as that for
studies conducted in previous years. The implementation of a new zonal parking system for the 2014-
2015 academic year, however, triggered minor changes to the methodology used for the annual parking
utilization survey conducted this year. This report clearly identifies methodology changes that were
triggered by the implementation of the zonal parking system. It also identifies instances in which direct,
year-to-year comparisons are limited or not possible due to these changes in methodology. The specific
changes are discussed throughout the document as they relate to the various report elements.

One of the biggest changes triggered by the implementation of the zonal parking system was the
creation of the Residence Hall parking space and lot type. In previous years, most campus residents
purchased Student parking permits and parked in Student lots, an OSU General Use lot type. Student
residents parking on campus were not distinguished from other Student permit holders commuting to
and parking on campus. With the implementation of the zonal parking system, Parking Services began
selling Residence Hall parking permits to student residents, and several OSU General Use lots were
converted to Residence Hall lots.

The Orchard Court Lot (3322) is an exception to this trend. This lot provides parking exclusively to
Orchard Court residents, but it is managed by University Housing and Dining Services, which issues
permits to Orchard Court residents. Because Parking Services does not manage this lot or sell permits
for it, it is not identified by Parking Services as a Residence Hall lot in the zonal parking system. In this
report, however, the Orchard Court parking lot is identified as a Residence Hall lot as it functions the
same as other Residence Hall lots, providing parking exclusively to student residents.

Additionally, there is a slight difference between how this report and Parking Services refer to parking
lot types. To reduce confusion when comparing reports from year-to-year, this report continues to use


January 21, 2015                                                                                                3
University Land Use Planning                            OSU PARKING UTILIZATION STUDY - 2014-2015


the term OSU General Use lots to refer to lots that are available to students, employees, and visitors for
daily parking on campus. With the implementation of the zonal parking system, Parking Services refers
to these lots as Commuter lots. In an attempt to bridge the difference between this report and other
OSU materials related to parking, “Commuter” is often included in parentheses immediately following
references to “OSU General Use lots”.

Timeframe
The annual parking utilization study is conducted during the fourth week of the fall academic term,
which is typically the point in an academic year when a university is at its peak enrollment. The study
takes place over a two-day period that includes both a typical laboratory day (e.g., Tuesday) and a
typical lecture day (e.g., Wednesday).

During the 2014-2015 academic year, the utilization count occurred on Tuesday, October 21st and
Wednesday, October 22nd. The percent utilization reported in this study for individual lots and sectors is
calculated based on the average of the two daily counts.

Parking Space and Lot Types

University Support space types are spaces that are not open to the
general public. They provide short-term loading areas, service vehicle parking, over-night parking for
vehicles restricted to campus, or over-night parking for university residents. Spaces that are temporarily
unavailable due to construction are also included among University Support spaces. The seven
University Support space types include: Residence Hall, Dedicated, Government, Loading Zone, Service,
Car Share, and Construction.

Within OSU’s main campus, there are four types of parking lots: OSU General Use (Commuter zone
lots), Non-OSU, Non-Public, and Residence Hall (Attachment A – Parking Lot Overview Map). OSU
General Use lots provide permitted commuter parking, short-term visitor and metered parking, or free
parking. Non-OSU lots are parking areas located within main campus that are utilized by an entity other
than OSU typically through a lease agreement. Non-OSU lots include parking areas for the EPA, Hilton
Garden Inn, the GEM, and the OSU Foundation. Non-Public lots are those lots in which access is
restricted or limited to a specific university group; examples of these lots are the Magruder Hall West
Lot (3362), Motor Pool West Lot (3334), and the Facilities Services Shops Lot (3208). Non-Public lots also
include small lots and loading areas that provide only Non-Public parking for service vehicles or timed
vehicle loading and unloading.

were classified as Non-Public lots. This
academic year, the lot type for the Orchard Court Lot (3322) was updated to Residence Hall. With the
closure of OSU’s housing co-ops, the Madison Avenue Co-Op Lot (3213) was converted to OSU General
Use lot (Commuter zone lot) in the B zone. The lots serving the GEM (3223, 3224) were re-designated as
Non-OSU lots because they are managed by a private, student-housing provider who leases the GEM
and its associated parking facilities. Several lots that previously had been designated as OSU General
Use lots were converted to Residence Hall lots to provide 993 additional parking spaces exclusively to
residents of OSU student housing facilities and dorms. These lots are not available to Commuter zone
permit holders.

Parking lots also are assigned one of three different lot statuses: Decommissioned, Temporary Closure,
and Active. Decommissioned parking lots have been permanently removed from the OSU parking
inventory. Lots that are closed temporarily for a defined period of time are classified as Temporary
Closure. A lot can be temporarily closed for special events, for maintenance activities, or to provide
construction staging areas. All other lots that have available General Use and University Support spaces
are considered Active lots, regardless of the lot type.

Utilization Calculation and Space Types included in Annual Report
Although OSU manages and collects data on all campus parking space types individually, the OSU
Parking Utilization Study only includes General Use spaces located in Active, OSU General Use lots
(Commuter lots); these are the only spaces available for use by students, staff, and visitors commuting
daily to campus. University Support space types and all spaces within Residence Hall, Non-OSU, Non-
Public, and Temporary Closure lots are not available for use by the general public visiting campus daily.
Spaces in these categories, therefore, are excluded from the parking utilization calculation.

The Motorcycle space type is the only General Use parking space type not included in the parking
utilization calculation. In most locations on campus, motorcycles park in designated areas rather than
individual spaces, so the parking capacity of a motorcycle area can vary greatly depending on how users
park their vehicles. For this reason, it is difficult to accurately, and consistently assess utilization rates
for motorcycle parking because the spaces available (capacity) can vary from day to day, depending on

how users park their motorcycles. Motorcycle space use is included in the parking utilization study, but
it is reported separately from the General Use space types.

As mentioned previously, the Residence Hall space type and Residence Hall lot type are new categories
this year, created as a part of the zonal parking system to provide parking exclusively to the residents of
OSU student housing. This year, student residents were able to purchase permits for designated
Residence Hall lots in the BR zone or CR zone. Orchard Court residents were provided with a permit
specific to the Orchard Court Lot (3322) issued by University Housing and Dining Services. Because
parking spaces reserved for student residents are not available to commuting students, staff, and
visitors, Residence Hall spaces and lots were not calculated in the overall utilization rate. Although it
functions differently than commuter parking, student resident parking remains an important part of the
OSU parking system and is included in this report. A utilization rate for Residence Hall Lots is calculated
and reported independently from the overall parking utilization rate. Additionally, this report also
calculates a separate overall utilization rate for Residence Hall and General Use spaces combined.

In years past, students living in on-campus housing facilities other than Orchard Court or the OSU co-ops
purchased Student parking permits and were free to park in any of Student/Visitor lots (an OSU General
Use lot type). Only residents of Orchard Court, the OSU Co-Ops, and the GEM were provided with
parking in Non-Public parking lots available exclusively to the residents of those housing facilities. Thus,
in previous years, most student residents were captured in the overall parking utilization calculation.
This management change contributes to the overall change in the total number General Use spaces
reported from academic year 2013-2014 to academic year 2014-2015, and it contributes to the slight
change in the parking utilization rate over the same period. This is discussed in more detail later in this
report.

Additional Parking Facilities (New Lots)
One parking facility has been added to OSU’s inventory of General Use parking facilities since the
completion of the 2013-2014 OSU Parking Utilization Study (Table 4: new General Use and University
Support Parking Areas). The Madison Avenue Co-Op Lot (3213) was added back to the General Use
inventory, adding 36 commuter spaces and 4 reserved spaces. Previously, these spaces provided
resident parking exclusively for co-op residents and was thus designated a Non-Public lot. As a Non-
Public lot, it was not part of the overall parking utilization calculation of previous studies.

 Decommissioned Parking Facilities
Two parking facilities were removed from the parking inventory for the 2014-2015 academic year: the
South Sackett Place Meter Lot (3292), located on the west side of Buxton Hall; and the University Plaza
South Lot (3279), located south of Western Boulevard on the corner of Western Boulevard and 15th
Street. (Table 5: Decommissioned Parking Areas). The South Sackett Place Meter Lot (3292) was
restriped as a loading area, converting two (2) General Use spaces and five (5) University Support spaces
to a loading zone and fire lane. In 2013, OSU began leasing the University Plaza property from the OSU
Foundation, adding 175 General Use spaces and three (3) University Support spaces in the University
Plaza South Lot (3279) to the parking inventory for academic year 2013-2014. This year, however, these
spaces were removed from the parking inventory because the OSU Campus Master Plan 2004-2015
prohibits the university from managing parking located on property that does not have the OSU Zone
zoning designation in the Corvallis Land Development Code. The University Plaza South Lot now
provides parking exclusively for tenants of the University Plaza building.

Campus Population
Student Enrollment
Since the 2010-2011 academic year, student enrollment on OSU’s main campus has increased annually
between one and eight percent (1% - 8%) for the Fall Term, with a total increase of thirteen percent
(13%). Refer to Table 6: Student Enrollment Trends for enrollment trends over the past five years.
Students enrolled exclusively in Extended Campus (Ecampus) courses are not included in the adjusted
Main Campus Enrollment, since these Extended Campus students are not taking courses on OSU’s
Corvallis campus.

OSU Employment
To support OSU’s enrollment increases over the past five years, employment on campus also has
increased. Since 2010, the number of OSU employees has increased by thirteen percent (13%),
including faculty and unclassified, classified and temporary staff (Table 7: Employment Trends). Faculty
and unclassified staff comprise seventy percent (70%) of the employees on campus. Classified staff
represents approximately twenty-five percent (25%), and temporary employees represent five percent
(5%). Graduate assistants and student employees are not included as staff as they are captured within
the student enrollment data.

Parking Permit System

Overview
OSU implemented a new, zonal parking system for the 2014-2015 academic year. The purpose of the
zonal parking system is to better utilize existing campus parking facilities, to help reduce campus-related
parking impacts in surrounding neighborhoods, and to reduce vehicle congestion and emissions in and
around campus by increasing the probability that users will quickly find available parking in their desired
location.

The zonal parking system requires an OSU-issued parking permit to park in any OSU General Use
(Commuter) or Residence Hall parking lot on campus. The majority of OSU’s parking facilities provide
either General Use (Commuter) or Residence Hall parking. The zonal parking system divides these
facilities into seven Commuter zones (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C) and two Residence Hall zones (BR, CR)
(Attachment E – Zonal Parking Overview). Permits are priced by zone. Pricing was set to create an
economic incentive to more intensively utilize OSU’s historically underutilized facilities; premium pricing
was set for historically high-demand, A Zone lots, while value pricing was set for historically low-
demand, C Zone lots. B Zone permit pricing was set at the middle of the range, as these lots historically
had moderate demand.

OSU’s Parking Services sells annual, monthly, daily and hourly permits for all general-use, Commuter
zones. Residence Hall zone permits are sold on an annual basis. For short-term visits, individuals also
can purchase daily or hourly passes online, from a pay station, or directly from Parking services, and
there are metered spaces in several lots on campus (Table 3: Lots with Metered and Short-Term
Spaces). Specialty permits are sold for motorcycles, utility carts, carpools, and service vehicles. Those
with an ADA placard may park in any ADA space on campus with a valid permit for any of the seven
Commuter zones. Campus departments also can purchase reserved or dedicated spaces on an annual
basis.

Permit Sales
OSU’s parking system, Beaver Bus shuttle services, and some transportation options programs are
funded through the sale of parking permits. Over the past four years, the percent of OSU’s total campus
population with a parking permit has remained relatively constant, varying between twenty percent and
twenty-three percent (20% - 23%) of the total campus population. Twenty-two percent (22%) of the

Parking Capacity
Methodology Refinement
Three years ago, Oregon State University refined the parking capacity and utilization data collection and
reporting methodology. The adjustment in methodology resulted in utilization studies that more closely
reflected the experience of students, staff, and visitors using OSU’s parking facilities. The change in
methodology also established a basis for future analysis of individual space types. Under the new
methodology, data is collected on all parking space types in all active parking facilities on campus.
Parking utilization calculations and reporting, however, include only General Use space types located in
Active, OSU General Use parking facilities because these are the facilities available to students, staff, and
visitors commuting to and parking on campus. The 2014-2015 study is the fourth report using this
methodology.

Although the change in reporting methodology has allowed for a more accurate assessment of parking
utilization on campus, the shift to reporting only General Use spaces in OSU General Use lots limits a
direct comparison of the total parking capacity over the past five years. Studies conducted prior to
academic year 2011-2012 included spaces in Non-Public lots and city-managed parking along city-owned
streets within the campus boundary. University Support parking spaces also were included. The
inclusion of these parking facilities inflated the total capacity of parking facilities on campus by 618
spaces (454 in non-public lots and city-owned streets and 164 Service spaces) in utilization studies
completed prior to the 2011-2012 academic year. Because the parking utilization study pertains only to
OSU-managed parking facilities available to the general public, Non-Public parking and free parking on
city-owned streets were not included in the OSU Parking Utilization Study: 2011-2012 or subsequent
studies. Table 10a: Parking Lot Capacity for OSU General Use Lots includes a column for the adjusted
total capacity of OSU parking facilities to correct for the inflation of parking capacity in academic years
prior to 2011-2012. Totals in this column for academic years prior to 2011-2012 reflect the total parking
capacity reduced by 618 spaces. It is important to note that this adjustment is not a true loss in
capacity, as the inclusion of Non-Public lots and spaces inflated the total capacity reported in these
years.

OSU’s shift to the new zonal parking system this academic year (2014-2015) further complicates year-to-
year comparisons of total parking capacity. In years past, students living on campus in student housing
facilities other than Orchard Court, the OSU Co-Ops, and the GEM were required to purchase regular
Student permits to park their vehicles on campus. Resident students with Student parking permits were
not distinguished from Student parking permit holders who were commuting and parking daily. The
implementation of the zonal parking system created a Residence Hall permit type and a Residence Hall
lot type designated specifically for on-campus resident parking; 993 OSU General Use Student/Visitor
and Faculty/Staff spaces were reclassified to Residence Hall parking spaces. Because these spaces are
not available to students, faculty, staff, and visitors commuting to and parking on campus daily, they are
not considered OSU General Use spaces for the 2014-2015 parking utilization study. Residence Hall
space types were not included in the overall parking utilization calculation. Resident parking, however,
remains an important component of OSU’s parking management strategy, so utilization of Residence
Hall parking lots has been calculated independently from the OSU General Use parking utilization
calculation. Additionally, this report shows calculations for campus-wide parking capacity and utilization
rates both with and without Residence Hall spaces included.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) has plans to develop a 37mile long streetcar system 
in  the  District  of  Columbia.  The  purpose  of  the  streetcar  system  is  to  provide  highcapacity  and  high
quality  transit  service  to  District  residents  and  visitors  and  invest  in  infrastructure  that  will  catalyze 
economic  development.  The  first  streetcar  project  involved  partially  installing  streetcar  tracks  along  a 
2.3  mile  segment  on  the  H/Benning  Streetcar  corridor.  The  installation  was  done  in  conjunction  with 
the  implementation  of  the  DDOT  Great  Streets  (streetscape)  project.  The  recently  completed 
streetscape  project  reduced  the  crosssectional  width  of  H  Street  from  six  lanes  to  four  and  Benning 
Road  from eight  lanes  to six.  In  addition,  this  project  constructed  a  median  on  Benning  Road  and made 
other improvements typical of street renovation work. 

This  report  is  a  traffic  study  analyzing  the  impact  on  vehicular  traffic  by  implementing  the  streetscape 
and  streetcar  projects  along  H  Street  and  Benning  Road  in  the  District  of  Columbia.  To  assess  potential 
impacts  of  the  projects,  a  set  of  alternative  scenarios  were  developed.  The  evaluation  criteria  were 
based on measures of effectiveness metrics that were computed for each of the scenarios. The metrics 
were  pervehicle  delay,  volumetocapacity  ratio,  and  levelofservice  at  intersections  in  the  study  area 
and travel times along the corridor. 

The  executive  summary  presents  an  overview  of  the  study  area  and  the  two  projects.  Next,  the 
scenarios  are  described  and  the  performance  metrics  derived  from  the  traffic  analysis  are  presented. 
Finally, the results of the analysis are discussed and the conclusions are presented. 


Project Overview 
The  H/Benning  streetscape  and  streetcar  projects  occur  along  a  2.3  mile  corridor  from  H  Street  NE/1st 
Street  NE  at  the  western  end  to  Benning  Road/Oklahoma  Avenue  NE  at  the  eastern  end.  The  western 
end of the streetcar project begins near Union Station, on the Hopscotch Bridge, at the entrance to the 
Union  Station  parking  structure.  The  streetcar  line  continues  east  along  H  Street  for  approximately  1.3 
miles and turns southeast onto Benning Road at the intersection of H Street / Benning Road / Maryland 
Avenue  /  Florida  Avenue  /  Bladensburg  Road  (this  intersection  is  referred  to  as  the  "Starburst").  The 
streetcar  line  then  runs  on  Benning  Road  for  approximately  one  mile  until  it  reaches  its  eastern 
turnaround  point  just  east  of  Oklahoma  Avenue  NE.  There  are  27  intersections  in  the  study  corridor; 
five of which are unsignalized. 


Alternative Scenarios 
The  project  team,  in  consultation  with  the  client,  developed  a  total  of  eight  alternative  scenarios  for 
this study. Three of the scenarios were generated for the streetscape project and the remaining five for 
the  streetcar  project.  The  streetscape  scenarios  consist  of  a  2006  existing  conditions  scenario  with 
separate `Build' and `NoBuild' alternatives for the 2040 design year.

The  streetcar  scenario  has  a  year  2012  existing  conditions  scenario.    The  additional  scenarios  for  the 
streetcar  were  `Build'  and  `NoBuild'  for  opening  year  2013  and  `Build'  and  `Nobuild'  for  design  year 
2040.  The eight scenarios are listed in Table 1.

Below is a summary of each of the scenarios: 

                     Scenario  1a:  models  the  existing  conditions  of  the  H  Street/Benning  Road  corridor  in  the 
                     year 2006 with a general corridor crosssection of six to eight lanes. 
                     Scenario 1b: models the conditions in 2040 if the streetscape project is not constructed and 
                     the  streetcar  project  is  implemented  as  a  separate  planned  improvement  in  the  project 
                     corridor.  
                     Scenario  1c:  represents  a  condition  in  2040  where  the  streetscape  project  (a  reduction  in 
                     street  width  to  a  four  and  sixlane  crosssection)  is  implemented  along  with  the  specific 
                     planned improvements for the streetcar. 
                     Scenario  2a:  represents  baseline  conditions  for  the  streetcar  study.  This  scenario  models 
                     traffic conditions in the year 2012, with no streetcar in operation, existing signal timing, and 
                     existing traffic volumes. 
                     Scenario 2b: this is similar to scenario 2a, with the difference being a small increase in traffic 
                     volumes expected in the year 2013. No streetcar was included in this scenario. 
                     Scenario  2c:  This  alternative  is  similar  to  scenario  2b,  showing  a  small  increase  in  traffic 
                     volumes for the year 2013 with the addition of streetcar service. 
                     Scenario 2d: this alternative represents year 2040 NoBuild future conditions in the corridor 
                     if the streetcar system was not constructed. 
                     Scenario 2e: this alternative incorporates traffic volumes developed from the 2040 streetcar 
                     travel demand model as well streetcar operations.

Traffic Analysis and Performance Metrics 
Synchro  traffic  models  were  developed  for  each  of  the  eight  project  scenarios  for  the  a.m.  and  p.m. 
peak  hours.  Lane  geometry  included  the  number  of  lanes  for  each  approach  to  an  intersection,  lane 
assignments,  posted  traffic  speeds,  and  turn  lane  storage  lengths.  Traffic  data  included  vehicle  turning 
movement  counts,  pedestrians,  bicycles,  and  heavy  vehicles.   DDOT  provided  signal  timing  information 
for  existing  conditions.  Existing  bus  service  was  included  in  the  travel  demand  model  included  lines  B2: 
Bladensburg  RoadAnacostia,  D8:  Hospital  Center,  X1,  X3:  Benning  Road,  X2:  Benning  RoadH  Street, 
and X9: Benning RoadH Street Express.  
Synchro  traffic  software  was  used  to  model  the  streetscape  scenarios  and  to  develop  signal  timing  for 
the  streetcar  scenarios.  VISSIM  microsimulation  software  was  required  to  capture  the  refined 
interaction  between  streetcars,  vehicles  movements,  and  complex  signal  timing  in  the  streetcar.  Once 
the  streetcar  is  added  to  the  H/Benning  corridor,  some  intersections  would  require  a  dedicated  traffic 
signal  phase  that  is  called  when  the  streetcar  is  present.  This  is  because  streetcar  movements  such  as 
lane  changes  or  transition  from  centerrunning  to  siderunning  operation  would  place  the  streetcar  in 
conflict  with  vehicles  as  it  operates  in  a  mixedflow  environment.  From  a  Synchro  standpoint,  analysis 
of  intersections  with  streetcaronly  phases  is  challenging  because  the  streetcar  phase  is  not  used  in 
every cycle. 

The  Synchro  models  were  used  as  a  starting  point  in  developing  the  VISSIM  models.  The  study  time 
periods  for  VISSIM  were  the  same  as  for  the  Synchro  models.  Development  of  the  VISSIM  models 
followed the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) 7step process as outlined in the FHWA's Traffic 
Analysis  Toolbox  Volume  III:  Guidelines  for  Applying  Traffic  Microsimulation  Modeling  Software.  
Calibration of the VISSIM model occurred for the "existing conditions" model, and the calibrated model 
then  formed  the  basis  for  future  conditions  models.  The  existing  conditions  model  was  deemed 
calibrated  when  the  volume,  speed,  and  other  operational  observations  satisfactorily  replicated  those 
observed in the field. 

The  traffic  analysis  results  at  the  signalized  intersections  for  all  the  scenarios  modeled are  presented  in 
Table  2  though  Table  9.  The  results  are  described  using  intersection  LOS,  pervehicle  delay,  and  the 
volumetocapacity ratio (v/c) as measures of effectiveness (MOEs).  A summary of the analysis for each 
scenario are given below: 

                Scenario  1a:  the  results  for  the  year  2006  existing  conditions  scenario  show  that  vehicles 
                flow  smoothly  through  the  network  with  little  congestion  and  vehicle  queuing  during  both 
                the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. All study intersections operate at LOS `D' or better. 
                Scenario 1b: the results for the year 2040 NoBuild scenario shows that congestion increases 
                by  the  year  2040  such  that  the  Starburst  intersection  operates  above  capacity  during  both 
                the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, although the intersection operates at LOS `D'. This is primarily 
                related to increase in travel demand in the corridor.  
                Scenario  1c:  results  for  the  year  2040  Streetscape  scenario  show  that  reducing  the  cross
                section  on  H  Street  and  Benning  Road  creates  additional  congestion  on  H  Street  and

H Street/Benning Road Corridor                                                                             Executive Summary 

 

                Benning  Road.  The  intersection  at  Benning  Road/17th  performs  at  LOS  E  during  the  a.m. 
                peak period. 
                Scenario  2a:  for  year  2012  existing  conditions  in  the  a.m.  peak  period,  vehicles  flow 
                smoothly  through  the  network  with  little  congestion  and  vehicle  queuing.  The  "Starburst" 
                intersection operates at LOS `C' during both time periods.  
                Scenario  2b:  year  2013  NoBuild  scenario  would  operate  similarly  to  the  year  2012  existing 
                conditions.  The  a.m.  and  p.m.  peak  hours  would  have  little  congestion  and  vehicle  queuing.  
                The "Starburst" intersection would operate at LOS `C' during both time periods.  
                Scenario  2c:  the  addition  of  the  streetcar  for  the  year  2013  Build  scenarios  would  impact 
                vehicle  flow  due  to  the  additional  signal  phases  at  H  Street/3rd  Street,  westbound  at  the 
                "Starburst"  intersection,  and  at  the  eastern  turnaround  point.  Improvements  in  signal 
                timing  associated  with  the  addition  of  the  streetcar  operations  have  a  positive  effect  on 
                through traffic, lowering pervehicle delay at some intersections. All intersections operate at 
                LOS `D' or better. 
                Scenario 2d: the year 2040 NoBuild scenario reflects the forecast traffic growth without any 
                facility  improvements  beyond  signal  timing  modifications.  As  a  result,  the  peak  direction  of 
                travel  (westbound  in  the  a.m.,  eastbound  in  the  p.m.)  would  experience  increased 
                congestion  with  queues  that  would  spill  back  through  upstream  intersections,  though  only 
                the Starburst intersection performs at LOS `E' during the a.m. peak period.  
                Scenario  2e:  the  addition  of  the  streetcar  would  further  limit  capacity  for  vehicles  in  the 
                project  corridor.  Improvements  in  signal  timing  to  facilitate  the  streetcar  movement  would 
                minimize the delay on eastbound and westbound movements at the expenses of side street 
                traffic.  The  intersection  of  H  Street/13th  Street  would  operate  at  LOS  `E'  during  the  p.m. 
                peak period. 


Comments and Conclusions 
The key conclusions from the traffic analysis with regards to the streetcar and streetscape projects can 
be summarized as:  

                Streetcar  operations  within  the  rightofway  have  some  effect  on  overall  traffic  operations 
                in  the  project  area,  but  do  not  appear  to  create  congestion  that  would  exceed  LOS  `D', 
                except  at  the  H  Street/13th  Street  intersection  in  the  corridor  during  the  p.m.  peak  in 
                Scenario 2e.  
                Crosssection  reductions  as  part  of  the  streetscape  project  have  a  small,  negative  effect  on 
                intersection  operations.  However,  the  grid  network  in  Washington,  DC,  according  to  the 
                results  from  the  MWCOG  travel  demand  model,  appears  to  be  able  to  accommodate  traffic 
                on many different routes to reduce and spread congestion out at multiple locations.

                The  scenarios  with  the  streetcar  appear  to  improve  operations  over  the  NoBuild  cases 
                because  the  improvements  made  to  the  timing  and  phasing  plans  optimize  conditions  at 
                specific locations. 
                Streetcar  operations  at  the  four  locations  that  require  special  requirements  for  the  signal 
                controllers  are  able  to  be  accommodated  without  substantial  impacts  to  vehicular 
                movement in the corridor. 
                Cycle lengths in the corridor can remain at 100 seconds. 
In  summary,  the  deployment  of  a  streetcar  project  along  the  H/Benning  street  corridor  in  conjunction 
with  the  DDOT  Great  Streets  (streetscape)  project  does  not  substantially  degrade  traffic  conditions 
along the corridor.

mile long streetcar system in the District of Columbia. The purpose of the streetcar system is to provide 
highcapacity  and  highquality  transit  service  to  District  residents  and  visitors  and  invest  in 
infrastructure  that  will  catalyze  economic  development.  The  first  streetcar  project  to  be  underway  is 
the  construction  of  an  approximately  2.3  mile  segment  on  the  H/Benning  Streetcar  corridor.  Streetcar 
tracks  were  partially  installed  during  the  reconstruction  of  the  H/Benning  Great  Streets  reconstruction 
effort in 2009 and 2010. As part of the HDR led DC Streetcar Program Management team, Kittelson and 
Associates, Inc. (KAI) has completed a traffic analysis for the H/Benning Streetcar corridor.  

The geographic limits of the H/Benning streetscape and streetcar projects are H Street NE/1st Street NE 
at  the  western  end,  and  Benning  Road/Oklahoma  Avenue  NE  at  the  eastern  end.  The  length  of  the 
study  corridor  is  approximately  2.3  miles  long.  The  western  end  of  the  streetcar  project  begins  near 
Union  Station  on  the  Hopscotch  Bridge  at  the  entrance  to  the  Union  Station  parking  structure.  The 
streetcar  line  continues  east  along  H  Street  for  approximately  1.3  miles  and  turns  southeast  onto 
Benning  Road  at  the  intersection  of  H  Street  /  Benning  Road  /  Maryland  Avenue  /  Florida  Avenue  / 
Bladensburg  Road  (this  intersection  is  referred  to  as  the  "Starburst").  The  streetcar  line  then  runs  on 
Benning  Road  for  approximately  one  mile  until  it  reaches  its  eastern  turnaround  point  just  east  of 
Oklahoma Avenue NE. There are 28 intersections in the study corridor; five of which are unsignalized.  

The  traffic  analysis  was  completed  in  the  following  steps:  data  collection,  Synchro  analysis,  VISSIM 
analysis,  signal  system  optimization  and  operational  testing  using  VISSIM,  discussion  of  the  results,  and 
project conclusions.

DATA COLLECTION 
The  data  collection  for  the  project  included  the  following:  a  site  visit,  turning  movement  counts 
collected  in  July  2012,  archived  traffic  data  from  DDOT,  signal  timing  plans,  travel  demand  model  data 
from MWCOG, and aerial photography from Google Maps and Google Earth.  


Site Visit 
A site visit of the entire corridor was conducted on July 17, 2012 during the afternoon peak period. The 
corridor  was  observed  on  foot,  by  car,  and  by  bus.  Observations  included:  lane  assignments, 
intersection geometry, turning movement restrictions, signal operations, the location of streetcar stops, 
and other components of the built environment. 


Turning Movement Counts 
Turning  movement  counts  were  collected  TuesdayThursday,  July  1719th  at  22  signalized  intersections 
in  the  project  corridor.  Tube  counts  were  collected  during  these  days  and  used  to  determine  the  a.m. 
and p.m. peak hours of the system. For the study corridor the peak hours were determined to be: 

                AM Peak Hour: 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. 
                PM Peak Hour: 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. 
The  turning  movement  counts  included  pedestrian,  bicycle,  and  heavy  vehicle  volumes.  Turning 
movement counts can be found in Appendix 1. 


Archived Traffic Data 
Traffic  volume  maps  from  the  District  of  Columbia's  Department  of  Transportation  (DDOT)  website 
were  accessed  in  order  to  determine  an  annual  rate  traffic  growth  in  the  study  corridor.  Previously 
collected  traffic  data  from  May,  2011  from  the  Starburst  intersection  and  the  intersection  of  Maryland 
Avenue and 14th Street were used to develop a seasonal adjustment factor.  


Signal Timing 
Signal  timing  plans  were  requested  and  supplied  from  the  DC  Department  of  Public  Works,  Bureau  of 
Traffic Services. The information from the timing plans was entered for each intersection in the Synchro 
traffic model. From Synchro, signal phasing and timing information was exported to create signal timing 
files for use in the VISSIM simulation model.

Travel Demand Models 
HDR developed the future year 2040 travel demand models using the Metropolitan Washington Council 
of  Government's  (MWCOG)  Version  2.3  Travel  Model.  MWCOG's  travel  demand  model  uses  the  Cube 
software  platform.  In  addition  to  the  existing  year  2012  model,  four  specific  year  2040  models  were 
developed  based  on  the  requirements  of  the  analysis  set  forth  by  DDOT.  Output  data  from  the  model 
was used to develop future year 2040 traffic volumes.

ALTERNATIVES 
The  alternative  scenarios  to  be  constructed  and  analyzed  were  developed  and  agreed  upon  during  a 
kickoff meeting with the project team. Meeting notes from the kickoff meeting are in Appendix 2. The 
alternatives  were  developed  and  analyzed  in  order  to  determine  if  any  impacts  on  traffic  operations 
would occur, and what their magnitude might be. 

The  H  Street/Benning  Road  study  has  undergone  two  improvement  projects  over  the  past  six  years:  a 
DDOT Great Streets (streetscape) project and the construction of a new streetcar line. Therefore, it was 
necessary  to  analyze  the  potential  impacts  of  both  projects  in  the  H  Street/Benning  Road  study 
corridor. The recently completed streetscape project reduced the crosssectional width of H Street from 
six lanes to four and Benning Road from eight lanes to six. In addition, this project constructed a median 
on  Benning  Road  and  made  other  improvements  typical  of  street  renovation  work.  The  second  project 
was  the  initial  installation  and  upcoming  operation  of  the  District  of  Columbia's  modern  era  streetcar 
system.  Figure  1  on  the  following  page  shows  the  typical  crosssections  on  H  Street  and  Benning  Road 
before and after the streetscape and streetcar projects.  

While  both  of  these  projects  might  have  potential  traffic  operational  and  other  impacts  that  are 
independent  from  one  another,  there  are  some  areas  of  overlap  due  to  the  fact  that  they  were 
constructed at approximately the same time. The analysis takes these facts into account.  

To  determine  if  there  are  any  potential  streetscape  transportation  impact(s),  the  following  three 
scenarios shown in Table 10 were analyzed and described below:

Scenario 1a: 2006 Existing Conditions 
Scenario  1a  describes  the  existing  conditions  of  the  H  Street/Benning  Road  corridor  as  it  existed  in  the 
year  2006,  before  any  of  the  streetscape  work  had  begun.  The  general  crosssection  of  the  corridor  is 
either six or eightlanes. 


Scenario 1b: 2040 NoBuild 
Scenario 1b describes the future conditions of the streetscape project if the streetscape project was not 
constructed  and  the  crosssections  remained  the  same  as  in  the  year  2006.  In  this  scenario,  the 
streetcar would be a separate, but planned improvement in the project corridor; therefore it is included 
in the NoBuild analysis.  

                                                                 21                                   Kittelson & Associates, Inc.

Scenario 1c: 2040 Streetscape 
Scenario 1c represents a typical Build condition, where both the specific planned improvements as well 
as  any  NoBuild  improvements  are  included  as  part  of  the  analysis.  In  this  scenario,  the  streetcar  is 
included  as  a  NoBuild  improvement,  and  the  reduction  in  street  width  to  a  four  and  sixlane  cross
sectional is reflected in this scenario. 

To  determine  if  there  are  any  potential  streetcar  transportation  impact(s),  the  following  five  scenarios 
shown in Table 11 were analyzed and described below:

Scenario 2a: 2012 Existing Conditions 
This scenario represents the baseline conditions along the study corridor. It reflects traffic conditions on 
the  corridor  in  the  year  2012,  with  no  streetcar  in  operation,  existing  signal  timing,  and  existing  traffic 
volumes.  


Scenario 2b: 2013 NoBuild 
This  alternative  was  based  on  scenario  2a,  with  the  only  difference  being  the  small  increase  in  traffic 
volumes expected in the year 2013. No streetcar was included in this scenario and no changes made to 
signal timing were made.  


Scenario 2c: 2013 Streetcar 
This  alternative  is  similar  to  scenario  2b,  except  that  the  streetcar  has  been  added.  For  this  scenario, 
bus service in the project area is assumed to continue serving the corridor as per their existing routes. 

To accommodate the streetcar, several alterations were made the year 2013 NoBuild model: 


Modelwide 
Streetcars  were  added  to  the  model,  running  on  10minute  headways  in  each  direction.  The  streetcar 
was  modeled  running  in  the  curb  lane  and  serving  curb  stations  to  the  west  of  the  "Starburst" 
intersection.  East  of  the  "Starburst",  the  streetcar  was  modeled  running  in  the  inside  traffic  lane  and 
serving  median  stops.  For  this  scenario,  changes  were  made  to  the  signal  timing  along  the  corridor, 
including  an  extensive  review  of  the  signal  timing  at  the  `Starburst'  intersection.  The  signal  timing  was 

                                                               23                                        Kittelson & Associates, Inc. 
H Street/Benning Road Corridor                                                                                    Alternatives 

 

changed  based  on  the  time  of  day  and  was  consistent  with  the  recommended  signal  timing  plans 
developed in the Synchro analysis. 


Western Streetcar Terminus 
At H Street/3rd Street, the streetcar tracks were modeled to transition for rightlanerunning to the west 
of  3rd  Street  to  medianrunning  to  the  east  of  3rd  Street  to  access  the  new  Union  Station  stop.  In  both 
directions,  waiting  streetcars  were  modeled  to  call  for  a  streetcaronly  phase  at  the  3rd  Street  signal 
where  these  vehicles  can  make  this  transition.  Westbound  vehicles  stop  and  wait  in  the  travel  lane  at 
the  nearside  curb  station  at  3rd  Street.  Upon  traversing  the  intersection,  these  vehicles  wait  for  the 
Union  Station  stop  to  clear  before  proceeding  to  access  the  station.  Eastbound  vehicles  wait  for  the 
streetcaronly  phase  in  the  median  tracks  west  of  3rd  Street.  The  Union  Station  stop  would  require  the 
easternmost  garage  access  to  become  an  unsignalized  rightin/rightout  intersection  and  would 
eliminate  the  eastbound  rightturn  lane  at  H  Street/3rd.  The  lane  transition  movements  at  H  Street/3rd 
Street are shown below in Figure 2.

"Starburst" Intersection 

At  this  location,  the  streetcar  transitions  from  curbrunning  tracks  to  the  west  of  the  Starburst  on  H 
Street,  to  medianrunning  to  the  east  of  the  Starburst  on  Benning  Road.  Westbound  streetcars  were 
modeled  using  an  advance  queue  jump  signal  phase  to  transition  from  the  median  Benning  Road  lane 
to the rightmost through H Street lane; this phase would also allow a concurrent eastbound movement 
of  autos  and  streetcars.  In  the  eastbound  direction,  the  streetcar  does  not  change  lanes  due  to  a  lane 
reconfiguration.  The  left  lane  of  H  Street  would  become  a  leftturn  lane  to  Bladensburg  Road,  and  a 
second  eastbound  lane  through  the  intersection  could  be  created  by  removing  onstreet  parking  from 
the curb lane between 14th Street and Starburst. The lane transitions are shown below in Figure 3.

Eastern Streetcar Terminus 
The  streetcars  were  modeled  to  reverse  direction  in  the  median  east  of  Oklahoma  Avenue  NE. 
Eastbound  streetcars  would  transition  from  the  eastbound  through  vehicle  lane  to  a  median  pocket 
track  and  reverse  direction.  The  streetcar  would  then  remain  in  the  median  and  trigger  a  new  traffic 
signal located on Benning Road, east of Oklahoma Avenue, which stops westbound Benning Road traffic 
so  the  streetcar  may  safety  pull  into  the  leftmost  through  vehicle  lane  and  begin  running  the 
westbound route. This turnaround maneuver is shown in Figure 4. 




                                                                                                                                    
Figure 4. Eastern Streetcar Terminus 


Maintenance Yard 
The maintenance yard for the streetcar is planned to be located on the north side of Benning Road near 
24th  Street.  Streetcars  would  need  to  cross  westbound  Benning  Road  and  enter  mixedflow  lanes  on 
Benning Road in both directions when traveling in and out of the yard. These movements would require 
special  traffic  signal phases.  However,  as  travel  in and  out  of  the yard  is  only  expected  to  occur  outside 
of peak analysis hours, this operation was not included in the VISSIM models.  


Scenario 2d: 2040 NoBuild 
This  alternate  represents  future  conditions  in  the  corridor  if  the  streetcar  system  was  not  constructed 
and in operation. Traffic volumes were developed as previously described, and represent potential year 
2040 conditions in the corridor.

Scenario 2e: 2040 Streetcar 
This  alternative  incorporates  traffic  volumes  developed  from  the  2040  streetcar  travel  demand  model 
as  well  streetcar  operations  similar  to  the  2013  streetcar  scenario.  The  signal  timings  were  modified  to 
accommodate both the streetcar and the increase in vehicle traffic. 


Measures of Effectiveness 
As  shown  above  in  Table  10  and  Table  11,  the  scenarios  were  modeled  with  a  combination  of  Synchro 
and  VISSIM  software  packages.  Section  4:  Methodology,  details  how  each  software  package  was  used 
for the analysis. For each scenario, the volumetocapacity (v/c) ratio, pervehicle delay, levelofservice 
(LOS),  95th  percentile  queuing  results  were  produced  for  the  signalized  intersections  in  the  study  area. 
For  the  streetcar  scenarios,  corridorwide  operations  were  further  analyzed  by  examining  the  travel 
time needed to traverse H Street, Benning Road, and the full length of the corridor. 

This  analysis  was  conducted  in  conjunction  with  ongoing  work  to  develop  a  concept  of  operations  for 
the streetcar. The requirements needed to operate the streetcar in the H Street/Benning Road corridor 
are  reflected  in  the  results,  and  the  analysis  itself  provided  an  opportunity  to  test  multiple  methods  of 
potential signal operation schemas.

Seasonal and Yearly Factors   
Traffic  data  for  the  analysis  was  collected  in  July.  Owing  to  the  fact  that  traffic  in  the  District  of 
Columbia  is  lower  during  the  summer  months,  DDOT  requires  that  either  traffic  data  be  collected 
during  the  nonsummer  months,  or  be  adjusted  to  account  for  the  lower  summer  volumes.  Therefore, 
an  adjustment  was  made  to  the  July  counts  so  that  they  would  more  accurately  reflect  a  typical  non

summer, nonholiday  midweekday.  This  was done  by  comparing  intersection  volumes collected during 
May  with  the  traffic  collected  in  July.  The  intersection  to  intersection  comparison  showed  that  July 
counts  needed  to  be  adjusted  upward  by  approximately  3.5  percent  to  reflect  a  typical  nonsummer, 
nonholiday midweekday. 

A  yearly  growth  factor  was  needed  to  forecast  year  2012  volumes  to  year  2006  volumes,  and  to 
forecast  year  2013  volumes.  This  factor  was  determined  by  analyzing  several  intersections  within  the 
study  corridor  for  the  years  20062009.  These  were  the  years  that  historical  traffic  data  was  available 
from  DDOT.  The  analysis  showed  that  traffic  increased  by  roughly  0.78  percent  per  annum.  Accounting 
for  six  of  growth  between  the  year  2006  and  the  year  2012,  the  0.78  percent  annual  factor  was 
multiplied  by  six,  then  subtracted  from  1.00  (or  100  percent  of  2012  traffic  volumes),  to  create  a  six
year  adjustment  factor  of  0.9532.  That  is,  year  2006  traffic  volumes  are  approximately  95  percent  of 
year  2012  volumes.  Similarly,  year  2012  traffic  volumes  were  increased  by  0.78  percent  to  create  year 
2013 volumes. 


2006, 2012, and 2013 Volume Development 
After  the  seasonal  factor  was  applied  to  the  raw  year  2012  peak  hour  traffic  counts,  the  volumes  were 
rounded and balanced between intersections to remove any minor inconsistencies inherent in the data 
collection.  This  step  merely  added  or  subtracted  volumes  between  adjacent  intersections  to  prevent 
vehicles  from  "appearing"  or  "disappearing"  between  locations  without  driveways,  side  streets,  or  to 
other vehicle sinks and sources. In most cases, it is preferable to increase volumes during the balancing 
process  as  to  err  on  the  side  of  higher  number  of  vehicles,  as  this  would  account  for  potentially  worse 
intersection  operations.  Once  the  year  2012  volumes  were  errorchecked  and  finalized,  they  were 
forecast  to  the  year  2006  and  forecast  to  the  year  2013.  The  year  2006  and  year  2013  volumes  then 
were rounding, balanced, went through the QA/QC process and were finalized. 


Travel Demand Modeling 
Travel  demand  modeling  data  was  produced  by  HDR  using  the  most  current  version  (Version  2.3)  of 
MWCOG's  model,  which  runs  the  Cube  software.  Using  the  MWCOG's  existing  conditions  model  as  the 
base,  HDR  produced  four  additional  year  2040  models  containing  specific  network  changes  needed  for 
the future scenarios. These edits included: adding the streetcar as a mode choice, altering the roadway 
crosssections, and updating link capacities. Table 12 shows the five modeling scenarios.

Modeling  output  used  for  all  three  time  periods  for  each  of  the  five  scenarios  included  link  volumes, 
turning movement volumes, and link capacities. This data was then used to develop turning movement 
volumes using the NCHRP 255 procedures. 


Year 2040 Volume Development 
Volumes for the year 2040 were developed using the NCHRP 255 process. The NCHRP 255 process uses 
three  sets  of  data  and  to  develop  future  year  traffic  volumes.  The  three  data  sets  needed  are:  existing 
year  turning  movements,  existing  year  travel  demand  link  volume  data,  and  future  year  travel  demand 
link  volume  data.  The  method  creates  three  potential  future  year  volumes,  and  relies  on  the  judgment 
of  the  traffic  engineer  or  transportation  planner  to  select  the  best  outcome.  The  three  methods  of 
future volume development are the ratio method, the difference method, and the average between the 
ratio and difference method.  

The  first  method  is  the  ratio  method,  which  compares  future  model  volumes  to  existing  volumes  to 
determine  a  network  link  growth  rate,  then  applies  that  growth  rate  to  the  existing  (known)  traffic 
volumes to create a future volume. The difference method determines the raw difference between the 
base  and  future  travel  demand  link  volumes,  and  adds  this  difference  to  the  existing  traffic  volumes. 
This  third  method  uses  the  average  of  the  ratio  and  difference  methods  to  create a  third  value.  Ideally, 
the  average  of  the  two  methods  is  the  preferable  choice  because  it  incorporates  the  strength  of  the 
ratio  and  difference  methods.  However,  in  cases  where  either  the  ratio  or  difference  method  produces 
a  result  that  is  not  useable,  the  selection  of  either  the  ratio  or  difference  method  is  advisable. 
Experience  and  engineering  judgment  are  the  key  principles  that  underlie  the  selection  of  the  most 
appropriate of the three methods to use. 

Volumes  for  each  of  the  four  future  scenarios  used  the  combinations  of  existing  and  future  models  as 
shown in Table 13.

For  both  the  year  2012  and  year  2040  models,  the  link  volumes  produced  as  outputs  are  for  multiple 
hours,  rather  than  a  single  peak  hour.  However,  both  the  Synchro  and  VISSIM  models  developed 
require  the  use  of  a  single  peak  hour  for  each  of  the  a.m.  and  p.m.  peak  periods.  To  convert  the 
multiple  hours  of  travel demand  model  data  into a  single  peak  hour,  a  factor  was  developed  from  tube 
count  data.  This  factor  is  simply  the  ratio  of  the  peak  hour  volume  to  the  peak  period  volume  that 
corresponds  to  the  multihour  period  for  each  of  the  two  travel  demand  models  (a.m.  and  p.m.).  The 
peaking factor was applied to each of the raw travel demand models before they were processed using

the  NCHRP  255  worksheets.  Once  the final  volumes  for  each  of  the  year  2040  models  were  completed, 
they were rounded and balanced for use in the Synchro and VISSIM models.  


Synchro Model Development 
Synchro traffic models were developed for each of the eight scenarios, for both the a.m. and p.m. peak 
hours.  Using  a  combination  of  aerial  photography,  including  some  historical  aerials  from  Google  Earth, 
as well as the site visit, the lane geometry was set up in the Synchro model. The geometry included the 
number of lanes for each approach to an intersection, lane assignments, posted traffic speeds, and turn 
lane storage lengths 
Traffic  data  was  entered  from  the  volume  development  process  described  earlier.  In  addition  to  the 
number  of  vehicles  by  turning  movement,  this  information  included:  pedestrians,  bicycles,  and  heavy 
vehicles. Intersection peak hour factors were determined and entered into Synchro. 
Signal  timing  information  from  DDOT  timing  plans  was  entered  into  the  model.  The  majority  of  the 
intersections  in  the  project  area  currently  operate  with  intervalbased  timings.  Synchro  uses  NEMA
phased  based  timings.  Therefore,  intersections  with  intervalbased  timings  were  first  converted  to 
phasedbased timings; the signal timings parameters were then entered into Synchro.  

The  Synchro  model  was  then  errorchecked.  Once  the  review  was  finished,  the  model  was  used  to 
develop the VISSIM models.  


Streetcar Signal Timing 
Once  the  streetcar  is  added  to  the  H/Benning  corridor,  some  intersections  will  require  a  dedicated 
traffic  signal  phase  that  is  called  when  the  streetcar  is  present.  This  is  because  streetcar  movements 
such  as  lane  changes  or  transition  from  centerrunning  to  siderunning  operation  would  place  the 
streetcar  in  conflict  with  vehicles  as  it  operates  in  a  mixed  flow  environment.  A  list  of  these 
intersections and details of how they will operate are provided in Section 6 of this report. 

From  a  Synchro  standpoint,  analysis  of  intersections  with  streetcaronly  phases  is  challenging  because 
the  streetcar  phase  is  not  used  in  every  cycle.  When  streetcars  are  not  present,  the  split  time 
associated with the streetcar phase is shifted from the coordinated phase serving H/Benning traffic and 
provides  additional  green  time  for  these  movements.  To  assess  the  performance  of  intersections  with 
streetcar  phases  over  an  entire  hour,  two  Synchro  models  were  created  for  each  scenario.  One  model 
included  the  streetcar  phase.  The  second  model  omitted  the  streetcar  phase  and  allocated  the 
additional green time to H/Benning through movements. Each model provided auto delay and v/c ratios 
as  outputs.  A  weighted  average  of  the  delay  (with  and  without  streetcar)  and  v/c  ratio  (with  and 
without  streetcar)  was  calculated,  with  the  weights  corresponding  to  the  number  of  cycles  per  hour  in 
which the streetcar will or will not be present.  

The  cycle  length  for  the  corridor  is  100  seconds  long,  which  corresponds  to  36  cycles  per  hour.  There 
are  12  streetcars  per  hour  in  the  corridor  during  the  study  time  periods  (6  streetcars  per  direction  per

H Street/Benning Road Corridor                                                                            Study Methodology 

 

hour).  To  avoid  underestimating  the  effect  that  the  streetcar  has  on  intersection  operations,  the 
assumption is that each streetcar will arrive separately from a streetcar traveling in the other direction. 
This should represent typical operating conditions given the selection of 10minute streetcar headways. 
Therefore,  there  are  12  cycles  that  the  streetcar  phase  will  be  called  within  an  hour,  and  24  cycles 
where  the  streetcar  phase  will  be  skipped.  The  total  intersection  pervehicle  delay  will  thereby  be 
determined  using  by  summing  the  streetcar  model  pervehicle  delay  and  two  times  the  nonstreetcar 
model pervehicle delay, divided by three. 

The VISSIM models utilize a "virtual" traffic controller, called a RingBarrier Controller (RBC). The RBC is 
derived  from  firmware  (D4)  that  operates  in  a  Type  2070  controller  used  in  various  cities,  such  as  San 
Francisco,  CA.  This  provides  tremendous  flexibility  for  how  a  signalized  intersection  can  operate  in  a 
simulated  environment,  while  ensuring  the  operations  are  rooted  in  reality.  Hence  the  VISSIM 
simulation is able to accurately reflect a cyclebycycle operation of the intersection, and the immediate 
impacts  of  streetcars,  buses  and  variable  traffic  demand.  More  importantly,  VISSIM  is  able  to  simulate 
how the intersection recovers from those events.  

The  signal  timing  plans  used  in  the  VISSIM  models  were  generally  based  on  those  developed  and  used 
in the Synchro analysis. The general operation of the intersection, whether it was actuatedcoordinated 
or  fixed  time,  was  maintained  through  the  modeling  exercise.  The  cycle  lengths,  coordination  offset 
values,  and  phase  green  times  were  programmed  to  match  the  Synchro  models.  The  programming  of 
the  RBC  controller  is  very  similar  to  programming  a  real  traffic  controller   various  tables  and  patterns 
are populated with timing parameters.  

At  the  locations  of  the  turnarounds  and  at  the  Starburst  intersection,  advanced  signal  operations  were 
introduced  for  the  Streetcar  scenarios.  Those  include  actuated  signal  phases  for  the  streetcar  which 
reflects  detection  and  streetcaronly  signal  phasing.  Additionally,  the  Starburst  intersection  and  the 
pedestrian  signal  immediately  to  the  west  of  the  Starburst  intersection  was  programmed  to  operate  as 
one  intersection,  with  the  signal  output  driven  by  a  series  of  overlaps   exactly  as  what  is  presented  in 
Section 6. 


VISSIM Model Development 
Development  of  the  VISSIM  models  followed  the  Federal  Highway  Administration's  (FHWA)  7step 
process  as  outlined  in  the  FHWA's  Traffic  Analysis  Toolbox  Volume  III:  Guidelines  for  Applying  Traffic 
Microsimulation Modeling Software. These steps are summarized below.

                Alternatives Analysis 
                Final Report and Technical Documentation 
The  study  time  periods  for  VISSIM  were  the  same  as  for  the  Synchro  models.  In  addition  to  the  peak 
hour  volumes,  a  thirtyminute  "warmup",  and  thirtyminute  "cooldown"  period  was  added  to  each 
side of the peak period, respectively. The warmup period of the model was used to "prime" the model 
for  peak  hour  conditions.  The  cooldown  period  was  used  to  provide  stability  to  the  model,  to  confirm 
that  peak  hour  spreading  did  not  occur,  and  to  verify  that  congestion  did  not  spill  over  into  adjacent 
time  periods.  Data  for  the  warmup  and  cooldown  periods  was  developed  based  on  the  same  traffic 
counts used to develop the peak hour data. 


Base Model Development 
Using the data outlined above, a base model was developed with the technical documentation provided 
with  VISSIM  and  using  industry  best  practices.  The  base  model  represents  an  uncalibrated  condition 
and  is  the  preliminary  step  in  model  development.  The  following  key  information  regarding  the  basic 
settings of model is summarized below: 

                VISSIM version 5.40

                Default vehicle lengths and distributions 
                Wiedemann 74 driver behaviors 


Vehicle Inputs and Routing  
Vehicle inputs were allocated to each entry point of the model based on the traffic counts. These input 
volumes  were  directed  through  the  network  via  routing  decisions  based  on  turning  movements  at  the 
study  intersections.  Routing  decisions  were  coded  in  a  manner  so  that  the  beginning  of  the  decision 
occurs as far upstream of the first decision point as possible. This enables vehicles to make a decision at 
the first opportunity to do so. 

As  a  result  of  the  calibration  process,  the  model  was  modified  to  include  eastbound  vehicles  entering 
the  network  at  18th  Street,  in  order  to  represent  vehicles  entering  the  Benning  Road  corridor  from 
unsignalized intersections that were not counted as part of the data collection effort. 


Vehicle Speeds  
Vehicle speeds were assigned to all vehicles upon entry in the network. Heavy vehicles, passenger cars, 
and buses were allocated desired speeds based in a distribution between 25 and 28 miles per hour.  

Reduced  speed  areas  were  placed  on  any  link  or  connector  whose  corresponding  roadway  geometry 
would  cause  vehicles  to  temporarily  slow  down  to  negotiate  the  area.  The  most  common  area  for

reduced  speed  zones  are  where  vehicles  make  left  and  right  turns.  The  following  reduced  speed  area 
settings were used: 

                Right Turns  12.4 to 15.5 mph 
                Left Turns  12.4 to 15.5 mph 


Conflicts Areas/Priority Rules 
Conflicts  in  VISSIM  may  be  modeled  using  conflict  areas  and/or  priority  rules.  Typically  it  is  desired  to 
use  conflict  areas,  though  certain  situations  may  require  the  use  of  priority  rules.  For  the  VISSIM 
models,  conflict  areas  were  used  instead  of  priority  rules.  Conflict  areas  were  applied  where  vehicle 
paths  overlapped  such  as  those  at  merge  and  diverge  points,  permissive  left  turns,  and  pedestrian 
crossings. 


Traffic Signal Control 
Each  signalized  intersection  along  the  corridor  was  modeled  using  a  distinct  ringbarrier  control  (RBC) 
file  which  stores  the  timing  parameters  for  each  signal.  The  RBC  files  were  then  connected  to  the 
corresponding intersections and signal heads in the model. 


Data Collection 
Traffic  operations  data  was  extracted  from  the  model  via  two  methods.  First,  each  intersection  was 
designated a "node" for which traffic volume, vehicle delay, and queue length were collected. Secondly, 
travel time points were placed throughout the model to collect travel times for various vehicle types for 
key segments of the network. 


Public Transit 
Existing  public  transit  services  were  included  in  the  model,  with  data  taken  from  the  Washington 
Metropolitan  Area  Transit  Authority  (WMATA)  website  on  August,  1  2012.  Routes  serving  the  study 
corridor are:  

                B2:  Bladensburg  RoadAnacostia    which  travels  northsouth  along  Bladensburg  Road, 
                using  15th  Street  for  northbound  and  14th  Street  for  southbound  service.  This  route  has  an 
                average headway of eight to 10 minutes. 
                D8:  Hospital  Center    which  takes  an  eastwest  heading  along  H  Street,  using  6th  Street  for 
                eastbound  and  4th  Street  for  westbound  service.  This  line  has  an  average  headway  of  10 
                minutes.

                X1,  X3:  Benning  Road    both  lines  are  an  eastwest  service,  with  X1  using  H  Street  and 
                Benning  Road,  and  X3  using  Florida  Avenue  and  Benning  Road.  These  are  peak  period  only 
                routes, with 15minute headways. 
                X2:  Benning  RoadH  Street    a  regular  service  line  along  H  Street  and  Benning  Road  with  a 
                headway of approximately eight minutes. 
                X9:  Benning RoadH  Street  Express   a  peak  period  route,  with  limited  stops  along  Benning 
                Road and H Street, with a headway of 15 minutes. 
The  other  bus  routes  that  pass  through  the  study  corridor,  which  neither  stop  within  the  corridor  nor 
operate during the study period, were not included in the model. 


Error Checking 
The  error  checking  process  is  summarized  below.  It  is  similar  to  the  process  outlined  in  FHWA  Traffic 
Analysis  Toolbox  Volume  III:  Guidelines  for  Applying  Traffic  Microsimulation  Modeling  Software.  Error 
checking was completed prior to model calibration.

Existing Condition Model Calibration 
Calibration  of  the  VISSIM  model  occurred  for  the  "existing  conditions"  model  only.  The  modified 
parameters were carried forward to future conditions models. The existing conditions model is deemed 
calibrated  when  the  volume,  speed,  and  other  operational  observations  are  satisfactorily  replicated  to 
those in the field. The calibration process is illustrated in Figure 5 below.  

Calibration  for  the  existing  conditions  model  was  based  on  reaching  target  thresholds  of  model
reported  results  versus  fieldmeasured  data.  The model  was  calibrated  based  on  traffic volumes,  urban

The GEH formula is:

For  this  modeling  effort,  the  following  guidance  was  used  regarding  the  GEH  score  of  calibrated 
movements. 

                   GEH Less than 2  Calibrated Value 
                   GEH Between 2 and 5  Acceptable Value

                   further calibrated 
Target goals for this model development are: 

                   85 percent of the modeled movements with a GEH score below a 2, and 
                   98 percent of the movements with a GEH score below a 5. 


Urban Arterial Calibration (Secondary Calibration Indicator) 
Some  adjustments  were  made  to  the  driver  behavior  parameters  to  account  for  the  various 
unsignalized  intersections  and  driveways  that  were  excluded  from  the  model,  but  create  friction  along 
the  corridor.  The  saturation  flow  rate  was  modified  through  the  adjustment  of  the  additive  and 
multiplicative  safety  distance  factors.  These  factors  work  in  tandem  to  determine  a  vehicles  desired 
distance to keep from the preceding vehicle. 

Visual Calibration (Secondary Calibration Indicator) 

VISSIM  is  capable  of  producing  a  visual  output  of  the  model  which  can  be  compared  to  field 
observations.  This  visual  observation  was  completed  to  confirm  that  the  model  overall  operates  as 
expected and that the representation of driver behavior is reasonable.

RESULTS 
The  traffic  analysis  results  for  the  H  Street/Benning  corridor  is  described  in  this  section,  organized  into 
two  parts.  The  first  part  examines  the  intersections  operations  for  the  three  streetscape  scenarios: 
existing,  NoBuild,  and  Build.  The  second  section  examines  the  intersection  and  corridor  operations  for 
the streetcar scenarios.  

For  all  scenarios  at  the  intersection  level,  operational  results  for  all  signalized  intersections  are 
presented in tabular format. The results are described using intersection LOS, pervehicle delay, and the 
v/c ratio as measures of effectiveness (MOEs). Results from all study intersections have been reported. 

The  lane  configurations  are  shown  in  Figure  6,  Figure  7,  and  Figure  8.  Results  for  the  three 
representative intersections are shown with an accompanying map in Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11 
at  the  end  of  this  section  of  the  report.  In  addition,  95th  percentile  queuing  results  are  shown  for  the 
three intersections. 

At  the  corridor  level,  the  MOE  used  is  travel  time.  Travel  times  are  reported  for  the  western  section  (H 
Street), the eastern section (Benning Road), and for the entire corridor as a whole. 


STREETSCAPE ALTERNATIVES 

Scenario 1a: 2006 Existing Conditions 
The  results  for  the  2006  existing  conditions  scenario  show  that  vehicles  flow  smoothly  through  the 
network  with  little  congestion  and  vehicle  queuing  during  both  the  a.m.  and  p.m.  peak  hours.  All  study 
intersections are LOS `D' or better. The operations summary for all intersections is shown in Table 14.

Scenario 1b: 2040 NoBuild 
The  results  for  the  2040  NoBuild  scenario  show  that  congestion  increases  by  2040  such  that 
intersection  operations  at  the  Starburst  exceeds  LOS  `D'  during  the  a.m.  peak  hour.  This  is  primarily 
related  to  increase  in  travel  demand  in  the  corridor.  The  operations  summary  for  all  intersections  is 
shown  in  Table  17.  The  complete  operational  results  for  the  intersections  within  the  entire  study  area 
can be found in Appendix 3.

Scenario 1c: 2040 Streetscape 
The  results  for  the  2040  Streetscape  scenario  show  that  reducing  the  crosssection  on  H  Street  and 
Benning Road creates additional congestion on H Street and Benning Road. The intersection of Benning 
Road  and  17th  Street  operates  at  LOS  `E'  during  the  a.m.  peak  hour.  The  operations  summary  for  the 
intersections within the entire study area is shown in Table 20.

STREETCAR ALTERNATIVES 
VISSIM  microsimulation  results  were  prepared  for  each  of  the  four  alternatives  per  the  modeling 
methodology  outlined  in  Section  4.  Key  MOEs  desired  for  the  analysis  were:  travel  times  along  the 
corridor, intersection delay, level of service, and 95th percentile queuing reports for all the intersections 
in  the  study  corridor.  A  summary  of  the  evaluation  results  from  is  provided  below  for  every  simulated 
scenario. 


Scenario 2a: 2012 Existing Conditions AM/PM 
For  year  2012  existing  conditions  in  the  a.m.  peak  period,  vehicles  flow  smoothly  through  the  network 
with  little  congestion  and  vehicle  queuing.  The  p.m.  peak  period  shows  some  congestion  on 
southbound  14th  Street  due  to  the  heavy  leftturn  demand.   The  "Starburst"  intersection  operates  with 
acceptable  delay  during  both  time  periods.  Buses  stop  in  the  travel  lane  to  access  the  curbside  bus 
stops, temporarily reducing through capacity. The following tables provide a summary of the evaluation 
results from the VISSIM modeling. 

Table 23 shows the summarized GEH calibration results for the Existing Conditions model.

Scenarios 2b and 2c: 2013 NoBuild and 2013 Build  
The  year  2013  Opening  Year  NoBuild  scenario  would  operate  similarly  to  the  year  2012  existing 
conditions  as  the  traffic  volumes  and  operational  parameters  are  similar.  The  NoBuild  a.m.  peak  hour 
would  have  little  congestion  and  vehicle  queuing.   Similar  to  the  year  2012  existing  conditions  scenario 
for  the  p.m.  peak  hour,  2013  p.m.  peak  hour  would  have  some  congestion  on  southbound  14th  Street. 
The  "Starburst"  intersection  would  operate  with  acceptable  delay  during  both  time  periods.  All 
intersections would meet LOS `D'. 

The  addition  of  the  streetcar  for  the  year  2013  Build  scenarios  would  impact  vehicle  flow  due  to  the 
additional  signal  phases  at  H  Street/3rd  Street,  westbound  at  the  "Starburst"  intersection,  and  at  the 
eastern  turnaround  point.  In  addition,  the  streetcar  would  stop  in  the  traffic  lane  to  serve  stations, 
which  would  increase  through  vehicle  delay.  However,  no  areas  of  concern  were  identified  in  this 
scenario.

Scenarios 2d and 2e: 2040 NoBuild and 2040 Streetcar 
The  year  2040  NoBuild  scenario  reflects  the  forecast  traffic  growth  without  any  facility  improvements 
beyond  signal  timing  modifications.  As  a  result,  the  peak  direction  of  travel  (westbound  in  the  a.m., 
eastbound  in  the  p.m.)  would  experience  congestion  with  queues  that  would  spill  back  through 
upstream  intersections.  The  a.m.  peak  hour  would  experience  side  street  queues  that  would 
occasionally  spill  back  into  upstream  intersections.  During  the  p.m.  peak  period,  several  intersections, 
including  the  "Starburst",  would  have  demand  that  exceeds  the  available  intersection  capacity.  During 
the  a.m.  peak  period  in  Scenario  2d,  the  Starburst  intersection  would  operate  at  LOS  `E'.  During  the 
p.m.  peak  period  in  Scenario  2e,  the  intersection  of  H  Street/13th  Street  would  operate  at  LOS  `E'. 
Queues at the eastbound leftturn lane at the "Starburst" intersection in particular would spill back past 
14th Street, hindering traffic flow. 

The  addition  of  the  streetcar  would  further  limit  capacity  for  westbound  vehicles  at  the  "Starburst" 
intersection  due  to  the  queue  jump  signal  phase.  As  in  the  2013  opening  year  Build  scenario,  the 
additional  signal  phases  and  streetcar  stops  would  hinder  traffic  flow.  Peak  direction  congestion  would 
continue to occur.

H Street/Benning Road Corridor                                                                                   Conclusions 

 


CONCLUSIONS  
This section discusses the conclusions that can be drawn from the results for all modeled alternatives, 
and focus on the operation at three representative intersections in the study area.  


H Street/3rd Street and Western Terminus 
For all modeled scenarios at this location, for both the streetscape and streetcar projects, without and 
without the inclusion of the streetcar, this intersection performs at or better than LOS `D'. Varying 
scenarios produce slightly degraded results based on increases in traffic volumes or the inclusion of 
streetcar traffic. This is expected due to changes in travel demand in the corridor, yet the impacts do 
not exceed the jurisdictional standard. Volumetocapacity ratios do not exceed 1.0 at this location, for 
any of the scenarios. 

Signal timing for future year scenarios, including those with the streetcar, would be able to remain at 
100second cycles, and can accommodate streetcars running at 10minute headways during the peak 
a.m. and p.m. hours during the day. This cycle length would be similar to other intersections in the 
corridor and would allow for continued coordinated operations and vehicle progression in either 
direction, depending on the time of day. 

Westbound streetcars that reach this location and continue through the intersection up onto the 
Hopscotch Bridge to reach the reversing point are able to do without significant impact to intersection 
operations.  


Starburst 
The year 2012 existing conditions and year 2013 opening year streetcar scenarios (with and without the 
streetcar)  appear  to  accommodate  traffic  within  LOS  `D'.  By  the  year  2040,  for  the  NoBuild  scenario, 
traffic  congestion  increases  on  the  network  as  demand  grows.  Intersection  operational  results  during 
the  a.m.  peak  hour  at  the  Starburst  intersection  for  Scenario  2d  would  exceed  LOS  `D'.  However,  the 
p.m. results indicate that operations at the Starburst intersection would be at LOS `D'.  

The  addition  of  the  streetcar  and  revision  of  the  signal  timing  and  phasing  parameters  at  this  location 
would  appear  to  improve  traffic  operations  to  within  acceptable  standards,  with  the  a.m.  peak  period 
operating  at  LOS  `D'  and  the  p.m.  peak  hour  operating  at  LOS  `C'.  It  would  seem  likely  that  NoBuild 
conditions  could  be  improved  as  well,  though  this  would  mainly  help  travelers  along  the  H 
Street/Benning eastwest corridor at the expense of movement on Bladensburg, Maryland Avenue, and 
15th  Street.  This  creates  the  possibility,  along  with  signal  retiming  elsewhere  in  the  corridor,  for  an 
examination of the opportunities to improve traffic flow by adjusting timing parameters.

H Street/Benning Road Corridor                                                                                   Conclusions 

 

Ultimately,  the  conclusion  at  this  location  is  that  there  would  be  no  significant  impact  to  traffic 
operations when compared to the NoBuild (or otherwise) with the addition of the streetcar onto the H 
Street/Benning Road corridor. 

For the streetscape scenarios, it would appear as if the reduction in crosssectional width in the corridor 
would  have  a  negative  effect  on  traffic  operations  at  the  study  intersections.  This  is  seen  by  comparing 
the  results  of  scenarios  1b  with  1c.  However,  the  results  are  less  clear  based  on  the  outputs  from  the 
Synchro  model.  Given  the  detail  required  by  VISSIM  in  terms  of  modeling  the  streetcar  operations  and 
the  ability  of  the  software  to  mimic  actual  signal  controller  operations,  VISSIM  presents  a  superior 
method of analysis when mixedflow conditions such as those that would exist on the corridor occur.  

Technically, the results for scenarios 1c and 2e should be much closer than they resulted. Both of these 
scenarios  contain  the  same  set  of  future  conditions.  Though  both  sets  of  traffic  volumes  were 
developed  with  the  NCHRP  255  process,  the  existing  conditions  travel  demand  model  was  different. 
This  was  because  the  base  condition  that  was  modeled  was  a  6  and  8lane  configuration  with  the 
streetscape  scenario  (1c)  and  a  4  and  6lane  configuration  with  the  streetcar  scenario  (2e).  These 
different starting points may have resulted in divergent results.  

Based on engineering judgment, it would be best to use the results from the modeling work to develop 
volumes for the 2e scenario for the modeling work for the streetscape scenario 1c. Additionally, VISSIM 
would  be  the  most  appropriate  tool  to  model  the  scenario  1c.  Based  on  the  results  from  scenario  2e, 
this  would  indicate  that  the  reduction  in  crosssectional  width  and  the  addition  of  the  streetcar  in 
streetscape scenario 1c would result in traffic operations that meet LOS `D'. Therefore, there would not 
be a significant impact in scenario 1c. 


Benning Road/Oklahoma Avenue 
For all modeled scenarios at this location, for both the streetscape and streetcar projects, without and 
without the inclusion of the streetcar, this intersection performs at or better than LOS `D'. Varying 
scenarios produce slightly degraded results based on increases in traffic volumes or the inclusion of 
streetcar traffic. This is expected due to changes in travel demand in the corridor, yet the impacts do 
not exceed the jurisdictional standard. Volumetocapacity ratios do not exceed 1.0 at this location, for 
any of the scenarios. 

Signal timing for future year scenarios, including those with the streetcar, would be able to remain at 
100second cycles, and can accommodate streetcars running at 10minute headways during the peak 
a.m. and p.m. hours during the day. This cycle length would be similar to other intersections in the 
corridor and would allow for continued coordinated operations and vehicle progression in either 
direction, depending on the time of day. 

Streetcars that access the route reversal point east of this intersection or those that travel to and from 
the maintenance yard would not have a significant impact on traffic operations on Benning Road.

H Street/Benning Road Corridor                                                                                    Conclusions 

 

Streetcar and Signal Operations 
The results of the analysis as they affect both streetcar and signal operations in the project corridor are 
discussed earlier in this report. Overall, the following conclusions may be made: 

                Cycle lengths in the corridor can remain at 100 seconds. 
                Streetcar  operations  at  the  four  locations  that  require  special  requirements  for  the  signal 
                controllers are able to be accommodated. 
                Streetcar  operations  within  the  rightofway  have  some  effect  on  overall  traffic  operations 
                in  the  project  area  but  do  not  appear  to  create  congestion  that  would  exceed  LOS  `D', 
                except at H Street/13the Street during the p.m. peak hour in Scenario 2e. 
                The  scenarios  with  the  streetcar  appear  to  improve  operations  over  the  NoBuild  cases 
                because  the  improvements  made  to  the  timing  and  phasing  plans  optimize  conditions  at 
                specific locations. 
                Crosssection  reductions  as  part  of  the  streetscape  project  have  a  small,  negative  effect  on 
                intersection  operations.  However,  the  grid  network  in  Washington,  DC,  according  to  the 
                results  from  the  MWCOG  travel  demand  model,  appears  to  be  able  to  reroute  traffic  on 
                many different routes to reduce and spread congestion out at multiple locations.

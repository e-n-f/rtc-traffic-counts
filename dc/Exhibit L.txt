1.0    INTRODUCTION
       In February 1978, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA)
       opened a 5.7-mile extension of the Metrorail Red Line and four new stations,
       including Takoma Station. The Station’s facilities include pedestrian walkways,
       bicycle racks and lockers, bus bays with loop, Kiss & Ride, short-term metered
       parking, taxicab stand and motorcycle spaces on 6.8 acres of WMATA property.
       Figure 1 is an aerial photograph depicting the existing facilities.

       This document provides an overview of the existing station facilities and offers an
       evaluation of the potential environmental effects of the reconstruction and
       reconfiguration of the facilities by a proposed joint development of the WMATA
       property by real estate developer EYA. The joint development itself will be the
       subject of the developer’s application for a Planned Unit Development before the
       District of Columbia Zoning Commission. Figures 2, 3 and 4 are a conceptual site
       plan, an inset focusing on the proposed parking area and a section showing the
       joint development and reconfigured station facilities.

  1.1 Description of the Joint Development Project

      The project consists of the following elements:

             A mid-rise apartment building developed over what is now the Kiss &
              Ride lot. Part of the green space on the western portion of the site
              would be replaced by the entry drive to the WMATA and residential
              parking garages
             A new Kiss & Ride facility would occupy most of the ground floor of the
              proposed apartment building. Takoma Station facilities and changes
              that would result from the implementation of the joint development
              project are identified in Table 1.
             The Bike & Ride facility shown on the table (an enclosed bike storage
              area) will likely be installed in 2016, ahead of the joint development
              project’s construction and is incorporated in the plans for the joint
              development project.
             The bus loop with be modified by adding an additional bus bay and a
              layover area.
             A 1-acre open space or village green will occupy the eastern part of the
              site.

      Prior to EYA’s development of this concept plan, WMATA conducted a
      Takoma Metrorail Station Access Analysis, September 2013 (“Access
      Analysis” identifying future needs for WMATA facilities.1 The analysis indicated
      a need for an additional bus bay, improved pedestrian access to the station
      from the northeast and east, additional spaces for shuttle buses, additional
      customer drop off spaces and expanded bike facilities. The analysis noted that
      the existing metered lot is generally used at less than 50% of capacity.

      Following the study’s completion, WMATA worked with EYA to produce a plan
      that meets WMATA’s future operational needs.


2.0   BACKGROUND

      This section provides a description of the Takoma neighborhood and the
      WMATA Red Line and Takoma Station.

 2.1 Takoma

      Development of the Takoma/Takoma Park community was initiated by New
      York venture capitalist B. F. Gilbert in 1883. Using the newly-built railroad,
      Takoma Park offered easy access to many desirable attributes of semi-rural
      living: potable fresh water springs, clean air, and a landscape that seemed truly
      a bit of country. Unlike other early commuter rail suburbs, Takoma Park, by
      reason of its dual advantages of being located on a major rail line, as well as a
      commuter rail stop, developed a healthy commercial district that, while it has
      waxed and waned over the years, substantially survives to the present day. For
      a time, Takoma Park was the largest city in Montgomery County, and for many
      years was also one of the largest cities in Maryland.

      Of special interest to its present residents and to historians is the distinctive
      character of Takoma Park's political and social structure. From its inception,
      Gilbert promoted political activism, and civic involvement in solving the
      community's problems. The city has also become perhaps the most racially and
      culturally integrated town in the metropolitan Washington, DC, area.

 2.2 WMATA Metrorail Red Line and the Takoma Station

      WMATA opened the Takoma Metrorail station in 1978. This section of the Red
      Line parallels CSX tracks from the Union Station Metrorail station to the Silver
      Spring Metrorail station.

      Weekday ridership has grown from 2,600 boardings at opening to an average
      5,800 boardings per day in 2014. Trains operate on two-minute headways in
      the peak hour and six- to ten-minute headways at other times. The Takoma
      Station and Red Line are located between two CSX tracks, which carry freight
      and commuter rail traffic throughout the day.


3.0   HISTORY AND PURPOSE OF JOINT DEVELOPMENT
      This following section provides a description of the history and purpose of
      WMATA Joint Development Program, the District of Columbia’s policy on
      development of public property, and the FTA’s policy on joint development.

 3.1 WMATA
     The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has an active
     public/private Joint Development Program. WMATA seeks partners to develop
     WMATA-owned or controlled property in order to achieve transit oriented
     development.      Pursuant to WMATA’s Joint Development Policies and
     Guidelines2, projects are encouraged that:

      1.  Integrate WMATA’s transit facilities;
      2.  Reduce automobile dependency;
      3.  Increase pedestrian/bicycle originated transit trips;
      4.  Foster safe station areas;
      5.  Enhance surrounding area connections to transit stations;
      6.  Provide mixed-use development including housing and the opportunity to
          obtain goods and services near transit stations;
      7. Offer active public spaces;
      8. Promote and enhance ridership;
      9. Generate long-term revenue for WMATA; and
      10. Encourage revitalization and sound growth in the communities that WMATA
          serves.

 3.2 District of Columbia

      In July 2000, the District of Columbia Office of Planning undertook a small area
      planning process at the request of the Takoma, District of Columbia, and
      Takoma Park, Maryland communities, and their political representatives to
      create a vision for the station area and properties in the vicinity of the station.
      The process included a community charrette and numerous meetings with
      community residents to arrive at a consensus plan. The Takoma Central
      District Plan was approved by the Council of the District of Columbia in June
      2002. The District of Columbia and the City of Takoma Park, Maryland also
      funded a transportation study to assess impacts of development on traffic and
      transportation. This study was completed in July 2003.              WMATA staff
      participated in the Takoma Central District Plan process and the Takoma
      Transportation Study process. Subsequently, WMATA completed a Takoma
      Metro Station Traffic Analysis Technical Memorandum (April 2014) (“Traffic
      Analysis”).3 The latter study was undertaken for the limited purpose of
      determining whether the proposed joint development would have a significant
      impact on area traffic facilities.

 3.3 Agency Coordination and Public Involvement

      The reconfiguration of WMATA facilities for the Takoma joint development
      project has been coordinated with Montgomery County Ride-On and the District
      of Columbia Office of Planning and Department of Transportation.
      Presentations have been made to the Takoma, District of Columbia and
      Takoma Park, Maryland communities and the Takoma Park Mayor and City
      Council. Meetings were held with then-Ward 4 Councilmember Muriel Bowser
                                   Page 11 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                       Environmental Evaluation
       and WMATA Board Chairman Tom Downs. WMATA conducted a public
       hearing on the proposed transit facility changes on June 18, 2014. On
       September 13, 2014, EYA held a workshop with the Takoma community to
       hear public comment on the plan presented at the June 18, 2014 public hearing
       in order to get additional community input on the development concept for the
       Takoma site.


4.0    ENVIRONMENTAL EXISTING CONDITIONS AND EVALUATION

       The following section documents existing conditions and evaluates the
       impact of the development on these conditions. The forecast horizon of this
       evaluation is 2020, the presumed start of occupancy of the development.

 4.1 Zoning and Planning

       The following section discusses current zoning of the development site and the
       proposed development’s characteristics.

      4.1.1 Zoning

       The project is located in the District of Columbia, within the boundaries of the
       existing Takoma Metrorail Station. The District boundary with the state of
       Maryland and the City of Takoma Park is immediately east of the station site,
       along Eastern Avenue. The adjacent Takoma Park neighborhood is dominated
       by single family, detached homes. West of the station site are several multi-
       story apartment buildings. Commercial uses line Carroll Street and Cedar
       Street south of the station. The elevated railroad tracks and station platform
       form the western boundary of the project site.

       The WMATA parcel is zoned for commercial (C-2-A) and residential (R-5-A)
       uses, as shown in Figure 5. A commercial overlay district along Cedar Street
       requires minimum ground to ceiling heights of 14 feet for most commercial
       development. The overlay does not include any of the area that EYA proposes
       to redevelop.

       C-2-A zoning permits low density development, including office, retail, and all
       kinds of residential uses to a maximum lot occupancy of 60% for residential
       use, a maximum floor-area ratio (FAR) of 2.5 for residential use and 1.5 FAR
       for other permitted uses, and a maximum building height of 50 feet above
       ground level.

       R-5-A zoning permits development of single-family residential uses for
       detached and semi-detached dwellings, and, with the approval of the Board of
       Zoning Adjustment, new residential development of low density residential uses


                                     Page 12 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                       Environmental Evaluation
      including row houses, flats, and apartments. The zone permits a maximum
      FAR of 0.9, and a maximum height of three stories or 40 feet.




      Figure 5 – Site Zoning

      Zoning conditions may be altered if a developer applies to the District of
      Columbia Zoning Commission for a Planned Unit Development and makes the
      case that the subject project is of high quality and provides public benefits. A
      part of the Zoning Commission deliberations, District of Columbia departments
      dealing with planning, historic preservation, transportation and the environment
      must provide review and comment.

    4.1.2 Planning

      Two planning documents have heretofore guided planning in the Takoma
      neighborhood.

      Takoma Central District Plan4. The 2002 Takoma Central District Plan defines
      near and mid-term strategies for revitalization and articulates broad development
      goals, urban design guidelines, and actions necessary to encourage and
      facilitate investment in the district. The plan calls for a redevelopment of the
                                   Page 13 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                     Environmental Evaluation
      Takoma Station site and suggests a development threshold for the Metro station
      site of 22-32 units/acre for townhomes. The plan also calls for 0.8 to 1.2 acre
      village green and a green buffer on the west side of the Metro parking lot. The
      plan in many ways has been superseded by changes in urban development over
      the past dozen years since it was adopted. For example, the plan calls for 1
      parking space per residence, a standard that is now considered excessive in light
      of a decrease in car ownership by today’s apartment owners accessible to
      transit.

      Takoma Transportation Study5. The District of Columbia Department of
      Transportation (DDOT) and the City of Takoma Park conducted a study that
      evaluated transportation conditions in the Takoma area of Northwest Washington
      DC and adjacent Takoma Park, Maryland. This study was a continuation and an
      expansion of the transportation work conducted in conjunction with the
      development of the Takoma Central District Plan. However, this study is dated
      and has been updated by the Traffic Analysis.

   4.1.3 Evaluation

      The proposed use is consistent with zoning for the site in that it is residential, but,
      because it exceeds matter-of-right requirements, it will require Planned Unit
      Development approval by the Zoning Commission.

      The proposed joint development for the 6.8 acre site is consistent with the
      guidelines of the Takoma Central District Plan, which recommends a threshold
      density of 22-32 units per acre (for townhomes) at the Metro station site. The
      proposed development includes a dedicated one-acre village green as
      recommended by the plan and a buffer between the project site and adjacent
      development as called for in the plan.

 4.2 Neighborhoods

   4.2.1 Existing Conditions

      The neighborhood adjacent to this development lies in two jurisdictions: the
      District of Columbia and Maryland. The Takoma neighborhood is one of
      Washington, DC’s most distinctive, and shares its history, name and character
      with Takoma Park, MD. Both neighborhoods are characterized by pedestrian-
      oriented streetscapes and low to moderate-density housing. A small community
      business district is centered around the Metrorail station and along Blair Road.,
      NW.

   4.2.2 Evaluation

      The joint development project will incorporate new housing into the
      neighborhood, increasing the population density. The project is not anticipated to

                                     Page 14 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                         Environmental Evaluation
      have long term effects on adjacent neighborhoods. Disruption to the
      neighborhood as a result of construction noise, dust and traffic will be temporary.
      Construction activities will comply with local noise, sedimentation and erosion
      control, storm water management, and other applicable regulations.

      Utility lines serving the site and in the surrounding neighborhood will be identified
      during the project’s design phase. The developer will coordinate with the utility
      companies during the design phase and before any construction begins in order
      to accommodate any affected utilities on or near the development site.

 4.3 Visual and Aesthetic Conditions

   4.3.1 Existing Conditions

      The project site is bordered on the northeast side by Eastern Ave, on the
      northwest side by the CSX tracks and Metro Red Line, and on the south side by
      Cedar St. NW and Carroll St. NW. Several single family homes are located
      across Eastern Avenue in Takoma Park. Mid-rise mixed-use development is
      located adjacent to the property across Carroll Street, on Cedar Street and
      across the tracks from the station site. The project site includes a landscaped
      berm, surface parking lot, and nine bus bays.

      The styles of architecture which highlight the development of this community can
      be described generally as follows:

              (1) The earliest houses were primarily combinations of Shingle and Stick
      styles and Pattern Book or Victorian cottages or variations of Queen Anne
      cottages. These houses are mainly of frame and shingle construction with
      asymmetrical massing and flowing roofs and exhibit a variety of design detail in
      the treatment of porch piers and balustrades, cornice detailing and trim.
      Examples are: 7130 Chestnut Street, 600, 535, 517, and 208 Cedar Street.
              (2) Turn-of-the-century Transitional house, frequently with Colonial Revival
      details, was popular during this period. The facades are frequently symmetrically
      ordered with Colonial Revival details such as Doric or Ionic piers and period
      window detail. Examples can be found at 516 Cedar Street and 521 Butternut
      Street; and
              (3) Bungalow, a style derivative of 19th-century British Colonial
      architecture in India, was a popular style and is characterized by a low house
      with veranda and broad overhanging gables. Some examples of bungalow
      variations can be found at 7106 Piney Branch Road, 202 Cedar Street, and 410
      Aspen Street.

   4.3.2 Evaluation

      The proposed development will introduce mid-rise development to the existing
      Kiss & Ride lot. This development is of comparable density and scaling to the

                                     Page 15 of 29

       surrounding area in the District of Columbia along Cedar Street and Blair Road.
       The highest levels of the proposed development are along the Metrorail tracks.
       The mid-rise development is proposed to be faced by direct-entry units
       comparable to townhomes on the Eastern Avenue frontage, with the apartment
       complex set further back from the street, so as to be more in scale with the single
       family homes across Eastern Avenue. The current vacant land on the site is a
       landscaped berm. The proposed development includes a green area which will
       be landscaped as open space.

 4.4    Socio-Economic Conditions

   4.4.1 Existing Conditions

       Community Characteristics
       The area surrounding the Takoma Metrorail station is racially and ethnically
       diverse, with around half the of residents identifying themselves as white, and
       half the residents identifying themselves as African-American, Asian, or other
       race. Approximately 10% of the residents identify as Hispanic. The poverty rate
       in the station area is around 7%, which is lower than the District of Columbia and
       higher than Montgomery County, but approximately the same as the WMATA
       service area. Median household income in the station area is higher than the
       District as a whole, but lower than Montgomery County. A summary of racial
       characteristics, poverty status and economic characteristics of the Takoma area,
       the District and Montgomery County is provided in Tables 2, 3 and 4.

       Environmental Justice
       A review of the demographics of the surrounding District area using 2010 Census
       figures shows the following:
             53% of the residents within ½ mile of the Takoma Metrorail station
              reported that they are non-white
             10% of residents within ½ mile of the station reported being of Hispanic or
              Latino ethnicity
             7% of households within ½ mile of the rail station report household income
              below the poverty threshold.


       Analysis Notes
       For the purposes of this analysis, the station area was defined as a half-mile
       distance from Takoma station’s main entrance. For race and ethnicity data, 2010
       Census Blocks were used; for poverty and income data, Census Block Groups
       and Tracts were used, where appropriate. Therefore, the total number of persons
       for the poverty and income estimates differs from the total used for race and
       ethnicity.

      WMATA owns the 6.8-acre property in question, upon which a surface parking
      lot, bus loop and landscaped berm are currently located. No residential
      relocations will be required. All transit access facilities (parking, bus, bicycle,
      pedestrian, etc.) are being replaced in kind or above existing levels with the
      exception of underutilized short term metered parking.

 4.5 Transportation

   4.5.1 Existing Conditions

      Roads
      Roadways serving the Metro Station site and vicinity are located in Northwest
      Washington, DC and in Takoma Park, Maryland. A description of the existing
      transportation network can be found in the Access Analysis and the Traffic
      Analysis.

      Transit
      The Takoma Station and Red Line are located between two CSX Corporation, Inc.
      tracks, which carry freight and commuter rail throughout the day. Approximately
      5800 riders board Metro at the station during weekdays. Metrorail service begins
      as early as 5:00 am and ends as late as 2:00 am. Parking for transit users at the
      Takoma station is provided in a surface lot accessed from Eastern Avenue with
                                    Page 19 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                        Environmental Evaluation
      approximately 160 spaces. Permitted parking hours and durations are limited to
      discourage all-day commuter use. These restrictions were a result of strong citizen
      action during the station’s design that was intended to strengthen the station as a
      pedestrian and transit hub rather than an automobile-oriented commuter station.

      Eight Metrobus and eight Ride On routes serve the station. Currently, most
      Metrobus and Ride On buses enter Takoma Station from Cedar Street, NW. The
      station’s bus facility currently includes nine bus bays for loading/unloading
      passengers, with Metro and Ride-On each using four bays and one bay not
      assigned. Most bus layovers occur on-site near the existing bus turnaround.

      Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
      The Takoma Station site is served by sidewalks along Eastern, Cedar, and Carroll
      Streets. Bicycle access is via the existing vehicular roadways.

   4.5.2 Evaluation
      Recommended on-site vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle improvements are drawn
      from the Access Analysis. The recommendations discussed in the following
      section are limited to those affecting the Takoma Metro station site and vicinity.
      Some additional improvements to other roads are recommended in the Traffic
      Analysis to improve overall transportation operations throughout the Takoma area;
      the reader is referred to the study for a further discussion of those improvements.

      Effects on Roads

      According to the Traffic Analysis, new development on the Takoma Station site will
      generate an estimated 100 additional vehicle trips in morning and afternoon peak
      hours. The Traffic Analysis was based on a development scheme with a 212-unit
      apartment building and 189 parking spaces (a .9 ratio), whereas later plans
      lowered the number of residential parking spaces to an approximate .7 ratio.
      Accordingly, impacts will be smaller than those analyzed and summarized below.
      The full analysis is presented in Appendix A.

      The Traffic Analysis study investigated the existing 2020 No-Build and 2020 Build
      traffic conditions at the Takoma Metro Station. In the existing traffic conditions,
      westbound and eastbound Blair Road experiences long delays when approaching
      Piney Branch Road in both the morning and evening peak hours. The congestion
      is caused by the insufficient signal green time provided for traffic on Blair Road. In
      the existing traffic conditions, westbound Carroll Street and southbound Piney
      Branch Road have long traffic queues in the AM peak hour. Northbound Piney
      Branch Road has long traffic queues during the PM peak period. However, the
      queues were cleared during most cycles.

      Outputs from the MWCOG model indicate an annual traffic growth rate of 2%,
      equivalent to a total growth of 15% from 2013 to 2020 in the AM and PM peak
      period. This 15% growth rate was assumed for the 2020 No-Build scenario. The

                                     Page 20 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                       Environmental Evaluation
      Traffic Analysis showed that the existing signal operation and facilities at several
      intersections will operate at LOS F by 2020 which indicates they are not able to
      provide adequate capacity to handle the future traffic growth in the region.
      Proposed improvements for 2020 No-Build conditions include signal timing
      optimization and lane configuration improvement. Lane configuration
      improvements include 1) adding a 100 foot long right-turn pocket on westbound
      Carroll Street approaching Cedar Street intersection; and 2) converting the curb
      side parking lane on northbound Piney Branch Road into a travel lane between
      Dahlia Street and Eastern Avenue. The results indicate the traffic operation will
      improve with the proposed recommendations and all the intersections will operate
      with LOS E or better. The proposed lane configuration would also be used for the
      Build analysis and evaluation.

      Under the 2020 Build conditions, there 44 and 54 additional vehicular trips
      generated during AM and PM, peak hours, respectively. The vehicles were
      distributed to the network by following the existing traffic pattern. The results
      indicate that the additional trips would slightly impact the traffic operation along
      Eastern Avenue, and the LOS would be reduced from C to D for the two un-
      signalized intersections at the joint development access drive and the existing
      apartment access drive. However, these intersections would still operate at an
      acceptable level of service.

      As part of the Zoning Commission’s deliberations, the District of Columbia
      Department of Transportation (DDOT) will review the recommendations of EYA’s
      traffic consultant. DDOT will recommend to the Zoning Commission any roadway
      changes needed as a result of the Takoma station development. WMATA will incur
      no cost for changes.

      Effects on Transit
      The Takoma station is served by WMATA’s Metrobus and Montgomery County’s
      Ride On Bus service with 73 buses arriving during the AM peak hour. Metrobus
      and Ride On buses access patterns are anticipated to remain the same into the
      foreseeable future. No new Metrobus routes are anticipated at this time at the
      Takoma Station. At this time there are sufficient bus bays to accommodate Ride
      On routes. Should additional bus bays be required for either service, the proposed
      joint development project expands the existing number of bus bays from nine to
      ten. The joint development project also provides an additional bus layover bay as
      recommended by the Access Analysis.

      Kiss & Ride and taxi parking will be relocated at the ground level of the joint
      development project. The new location for these facilities is closer to the Metro
      Station entrance than the existing facilities, which are located in the surface
      parking lot. The current plan provides 21 spaces for Kiss & Ride parking, taxis and
      shuttles. The inclusion of the shuttle spaces was recommended in the Access
      Analysis to accommodate potential service to and from a redeveloped Walter


                                    Page 21 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                      Environmental Evaluation
      Reed campus. Parking and a drop off area for people with disabilities would be
      closer to the station entrance than at present.

      The joint development project reduces existing metered parking (from 141 spaces
      to 87 spaces) in recognition of the fact that the parking is less than 50% utilized at
      present. Parking remains limited to seven hours to discourage commuter
      monopolization of spaces.

      Construction of the proposed development will not result in any significant adverse
      impacts to the CSX or Metrorail railroad lines. WMATA Adjacent Construction
      Guidelines will address any construction concerns related to construction activities
      in the vicinity of a rail station and line that may need to be taken into account
      during the development process.

      Effects on Pedestrian and Bicycle Access
      Existing bicycle and pedestrian routes to the Takoma Station will be enhanced
      under the joint development proposal, although access may be temporarily
      affected by construction activities. The Metropolitan Branch Trail, an 11 mile multi-
      use trail connecting Silver Spring, MD and the National Mall in the District, is
      proposed as a trail adjacent to the Takoma Station (Carroll Street and Eastern
      Avenue). The project incorporates a bike trail along the Eastern Avenue frontage
      of the proposed building. Further, in advance of the joint development project
      WMATA anticipates providing a bike station near the main station entrance in
      2016 to accommodate 104 bicycles.

      Two new paths also proposed to improve pedestrian access from what is currently
      the north entrance of the Kiss & Ride lot at Eastern Avenue and from the
      northeastern edge of the open space area. The first path will be a sidewalk within
      the new parking garage and will provide safe access to the station for pedestrians
      who previously cut through the parking lot. The second will traverse the current
      open space area from the station to the Cedar Avenue/Eastern Avenue
      intersection.

      The proposed project is designed to enhance the safety and security of transit
      riders—rail and bus, and pedestrians. Bus bays, bus layover and automobile
      parking areas have been located in areas that will cause the least amount of
      conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. In addition, lighting within the proposed
      development as well as the increased pedestrian activity due to the added housing
      units will contribute to a safer environment in the area.

 4.6 Air Quality

   4.6.1 Existing Conditions

      The Washington, DC metropolitan region has been designated by the U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a non-attainment area for ground-level

                                     Page 22 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                       Environmental Evaluation
      ozone and for particulate matter (PM2.5). Ground-level ozone is an invisible gas
      created when a mixture of air pollutants known as volatile organic compounds
      (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) reacts in sunlight and heat. These pollutants
      are caused by fumes from cars, trucks, buses, lawnmowers, leaf blowers, boats
      and emissions from power plants and industrial facilities. Motor vehicles produce
      50 percent of the region’s nitrogen oxides and 30 percent of the volatile organic
      compounds. "Particulate matter," also known as particle pollution or PM, is a
      complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets. Particle pollution
      is made up of a number of components, including acids (such as nitrates and
      sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. The size of
      particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Once
      inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health
      effects.

   4.6.2 Evaluation

      Construction Impacts
      The project’s construction activities will have temporary and minimal impacts on air
      quality within the immediate vicinity of the project site. Air quality impacts will be
      caused by construction engines and dust generated from construction activities.

      Joint Development Impacts
      The proposed project involves the construction of a new bus bay and layover bay
      but does not require any modification of the existing bus routes or facilities. All
      existing bus routes currently enter the site from Carroll Street and most exit from
      that same location or onto Eastern Avenue. The current site has 9 bus bays for
      loading/unloading. The proposed site will have 10 bus bays for loading/unloading
      and one bay for layover. The addition of a bus bay for layover will help to reduce
      the amount of idling and subsequent emissions. The project does not create new
      transit operations or create additional transit capacity. Therefore, no impact to air
      quality is projected.

      The proposed development is not anticipated to have an adverse impact on the
      local or regional air quality or to contribute to exceeding the NAAQS.

 4.7 Noise and Vibration

   4.7.1 Existing Conditions
      The operation of the Metrorail station and related buses and trains are the primary
      sources of noise at the site. Commuter vehicles utilizing the Metrorail station
      parking lot are an additional noise source.

   4.7.2 Evaluation

      Construction Impacts
      The project’s construction activities and related traffic will have temporary impacts
      on noise and vibration within the immediate vicinity. Construction activities will
      comply with the District of Columbia noise regulations.

      Joint Development Impacts
      Existing bus routes and transit linkages will not be changed from the existing
      condition as a result of the project, and the impact of the proposed residential
      development will be minimal. Therefore, no adverse impact is anticipated.

 4.8 Topography and Geology

   4.8.1 Existing Conditions
      The Metrorail site slopes to the north-northwest from an elevation of approximately
      279 feet the intersection of Carroll and Cedar Streets to a low point of
      approximately 256 feet at the Metro station parking lot exit on Cedar Street.
      Existing topographic conditions are illustrated in Figure 7.

      Geologically, the soils on the project site are classified as “Udorthents”. The
      Udorthent association is primarily earthy fill material, mixed with other matter,
      deposited over poorly drained to somewhat excessively drained soils.

   4.8.2 Evaluation

      Construction Impacts
      Some modification of the site landform will be necessary to construct the proposed
      joint development project. Grading activity will be undertaken in compliance with
      the District of Columbia Soil Erosion and Sediment Control program requirements.

      Joint Development Impacts
      No adverse impact to site topography or geology is anticipated as a result of the
      implementation of the joint development project. All exposed soil surfaces will be
      re-vegetated once construction is complete.

 4.9 Historic Resources

   4.9.1 Existing Conditions

      Takoma Park was founded and developed as a suburb by Benjamin F. Gilbert in
      1883. Takoma Park was the first commuter suburb in the area and was originally
      located on approximately 100 acres of land around the B & O Railroad tracks.
      Gilbert, in planning his suburb, ignored jurisdictional lines, and the original town of
      Takoma Park thus was located in the District of Columbia and Prince George's
      and Montgomery counties, Maryland.             Subsequently, Montgomery County
      absorbed the part of the town formerly associated with Prince George’s County.

      When Gilbert selected this site, few roads extended north from Washington, and
      during the first few years of its existence, Takoma Park depended almost entirely
      on the steam railroad for the movement of goods and people. The residences of
      Takoma Park were within walking distance of the train station.


                                      Page 25 of 29

Takoma Station Facilities                                        Environmental Evaluation
      The project site is located within the District of Columbia-designated Takoma Park
      Historic District (see Figure 8). The project site is located within the National
      Register of Historic Places Takoma Park Historic District, also.

   4.9.2 Evaluation

      No individual historic structure will be directly impacted by the project. However,
      since the project is in a Historic District, its compatibility with that district will be the
      evaluated by the District of Columbia’s Office of Historic Preservation.

      Because the area has been disturbed substantially, any archaeological resource
      that might have been present has likely been severely compromised or destroyed.
      Project design and construction must be coordinated with the Historic Preservation
      Office of the District of Columbia’s Office of Planning.

 4.10 Parklands

      No park is located on-site. No impact is projected.

      A one-acre village green will be designated on the southern end of this site, along
      Cedar Street.

 4.11 Hazardous Materials

   4.11.1 Existing Conditions

      According to historical records reviewed during the preparation of a Phase II
      Environmental Site Assessment6 (ESA), a gasoline filling station was located on
      the southern edge of the site from at least 1927 until at least 1960. Additionally,
      historical maps indicate that another gasoline filling station was located across
      Cedar Street from the Metrorail station, where a row of commercial businesses is
      now located. The ESA identified petroleum contamination in the soil and
      groundwater samples taken from the southern edge of the project site, where the
      former gasoline filling station is believed to have been located.

   4.11.2 Evaluation

      Site development will include the proper management of materials and
      remediation of the site as needed in accordance with applicable District and/or
      federal regulations. Buried fuel tanks, if any, encountered during future site
      development activities will be handled and disposed of similarly. The Department
      of the Environment and the Fire Marshall will be notified of any discovered tank
      prior to excavation and removal. Petroleum-contaminated groundwater
      encountered during future site development may need to be treated prior to
      discharge.

1.0     INTRODUCTION
The Takoma Metro Station is located on the Red Line in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
System. It serves the area of Takoma Park, Maryland and the Takoma neighborhood of Washington D.C.
A new residential apartment development is being proposed at the existing Kiss & Ride site to the
northeast of the station. The purpose of this technical memorandum is to document the existing traffic
conditions in the vicinity of the Takoma Metro Station, and assess the traffic impacts from the proposed
Joint Development for its projected opening date of the year 2020. This technical memorandum is
organized in the following manner:
    •   Study Area and Intersections
    •   Existing Conditions
    •   2020 No-Build Conditions
    •   2020 Build Conditions

1.1 Study Area and Intersections
The Takoma Metro Station is located immediately south of DC-Maryland borderline. It is bounded by
Cedar Street to the east, Piney Branch Road to the west, Eastern Avenue to the north, and Blair Road
and Cedar Street to the south.
The studied intersections include four signalized intersections and five un-signalized intersections, listed
as follows:
        1. Eastern Avenue and Piney Branch Road (signalized)
        2. Eastern Avenue and Holly Avenue (un-signalized)
        3. Eastern Avenue and Kiss & Ride Facility (un-signalized)
        4. Eastern Avenue and Bus Access (un-signalized)
        5. Eastern Avenue and Cedar Street (un-signalized)
        6. Carroll Street and Cedar Street (signalized)
        7. Carroll Street and Bus Access (un-signalized)
        8. Cedar Street and Blair Road and 4th Street (signalized)
        9. Blair Road and Piney Branch Road (signalized)

Figure 1 shows the study area, study intersections, and locations of the proposed development site at the
Takoma Metro Station.

1.2 Existing Conditions
This section presents the existing traffic conditions on the roadways adjacent to project and the purpose
of this analysis is to establish the base conditions.

1.2.1   Field Observation
Field observations were performed in the study area during the AM and PM peak periods. The purpose of
these field visits was to investigate the existing roadway and geometric conditions, traffic control
operations, pedestrian/bicycle activities, and transit operations. These factors could affect the traffic
operations at the study intersections.

1.2.1.1 Traffic
Figure 2 shows the key field observations of the existing traffic operation in the study area. The major
congestion within the study area is observed at the intersection of Blair Road and Piney Branch Road.
Vehicles experience long delays along eastbound and westbound Blair Road approaching Piney Branch
Road during both AM and PM peak hours. The westbound queues on Blair Road spill back to Cedar
Street, and the eastbound queues extend beyond Fern Place in the AM and PM. One major cause of the
congestion is the insufficient duration of the green time at Piney Branch Road and Blair Road traffic
signalized operation. Since there is only one travel lane on Blair Road, left-turning or right-turning vehicles
were observed blocking the though westbound traffic at Piney Branch Road intersection. It was observed

in the field that the left and right turning traffic from Chestnut and Dahlia Street are merging without being
blocked from Blair Road traffic.
Long queues were also observed on the following approaches:
     • Southbound Piney Branch Road approaching Eastern Avenue in the AM peak hour
     • Northbound Piney Branch Road approaching Blair Road in the PM peak hour and on
     • Westbound Carroll Street approaching Cedar Street in the AM peak hour.
However, these queues were cleared during most cycles. All other signalized and un-signalized
intersections are operating at acceptable conditions.

                           Chestnut St. No long
                           queues were observed
                           on these side streets.



1.2.1.2 Bus Operation
The Takoma Metro Station is served by WMATA’s Metrobus and Montgomery County’s Ride-On Bus
service. There are 16 bus lines serving the station during the AM and PM peak hours. There are 9 bus
bays provided at the station while 1 bay is currently not assigned to any bus route. WMATA buses
including bus routes 52/53/54, F1/F2, K2 and 62/63 use 4 bus bays, and Ride On buses including Lines
3, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 24, 25 use the other 4 bus bays. Despite the fact that the two bus-access
intersections are un-signalized, buses currently do not appear to encounter any problem in entering and
exiting the station.

1.2.1.3 Park and Ride and Kiss and Ride
There are no long-term Park and Ride facilities provided at the Takoma Metro Station. The Kiss & Ride
and short-term parking lots are located to the northeast of the Metro station. No congestion or
overcrowding was observed at the Kiss & Ride/Short-term parking lots. Informal drop-off and pickup also

occurs on Cedar Street adjacent to the station entrance. However, these vehicles do not create traffic
congestion.

1.2.1.4 Pedestrians
Sidewalk is provided on all the streets within the study area. Heavy pedestrian activity was observed on
Carroll Street, Blair Road and Eastern Avenue.

1.2.1.5 Bicycle
According to the 2012 bike parking census, the Takoma Metro Station has the second-highest number of
bike users in the Metro system. Many bicyclists were observed along Blair Road, Piney Branch Road,
Eastern Avenue, and Carroll Street. However, no bike lanes are provided on any of these corridors.
Cyclists either ride on the curb-side parking lane, or share the travel lane with cars.


1.2.2   Data Collection
Turning movement counts at study intersections were collected in mid-September, 2013 during the AM
peak period (6:00 a.m. – 10:00 a.m.), and PM peak period (3:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m.). According to the data
reports, the peak hour is between 7:45 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. in the morning, and between 5:30 p.m. and
6:30 p.m. in the afternoon. The highest hourly traffic volumes were used for AM and PM peak hour traffic
analysis. Appendix A includes turning movement counts collected from the field.

1.2.3   Methodology
A traffic analysis was performed for the study intersections using the micro-simulation tool VISSIM. Traffic
operation was assessed using Measures of Effectiveness (MOE), including Delay (seconds per vehicle),
Level of Service (LOS), and queue length (feet) at the study intersections.

Intersection LOS analysis provides a measurement of delay and service conditions for all approaches to
the intersection. The HCM 2010 edition uses LOS as a qualitative measure to describe the operating
conditions at signalized and un-signalized intersections based on control delay per vehicle (seconds). The
LOS range of A through F represents driving conditions from best to worst. Table 1 presents the LOS
thresholds for signalized and un-signalized intersections per the HCM 2010.

The VISSIM models were run 20 times, and the average output results were tabulated and analyzed to
determine the overall conditions at the study intersections during the AM and PM peak hours. In order to
replicate the existing peak hour traffic conditions at study intersections, the AM and PM peak hour models
were calibrated based on field data and observations.

1.2.4   Analysis Results
This section summarizes the delay, LOS and queue results from VISSIM at each study intersection during
AM and PM peak hours. The LOS results of the existing traffic operation are shown in Figure 3. See
Appendix C for the detailed MOE summary for the existing AM and PM peak hour conditions from VISSIM
analysis.

The results indicate that the VISSIM outputs are consistent with field observations. Vehicles on Blair
Road approaching Piney Branch Road experience LOS E and LOS F in both AM and PM peak periods.
The westbound queues on Blair Road starting at Piney Branch spill back beyond Cedar Street, which
makes westbound vehicles approaching Cedar Street experience LOS E and F in the AM and PM,
respectively.

Northbound Piney Branch Road has long queues in the PM peak hour approaching Blair Road
intersection. The 95th-percentile queue on northbound Piney Branch Road is approximately 1,100 feet
long.

1.3 2020 No-Build Conditions
2020 No-Build represents the background traffic condition in 2020 excluding the proposed joint
developments at the Takoma Metro Station. 2020 was selected as the analysis year because that is the
date the development is planned to open.

1.3.1   No-Build Volume Projections
MWCOG 2.3 model was used to project the traffic growth from 2013 to 2020 (excluding the development
at the Takoma Metro Station). The MWCOG model, which accounts for approved development projects,
indicates that three of the local jurisdictions including Washington D,C., Prince George’s County, and
Montgomery County are showing more than 10% total increase in households and employment from
2010 to 2020. Silver Spring, which is located to the northeast of the Takoma Metro Station, expects
significant growth in both jobs and number of residents. This study, assumed a total growth of 15% from
2013 to 2030 in the AM and PM peak period that is equivalent to an annual traffic growth rate of 2%.

1.3.2   No-Build Analysis Results
Due to the traffic growth through 2020, the existing signal timing or roadway alignment may potentially fail
to support the future traffic volumes. Note that this would be the case even if the proposed WMATA joint
development project is not implemented. Several scenarios were tested to assess the future traffic
conditions and to potentially improve the traffic operations for 2020 No-Build, including:
    1) Keeping the existing signal timing and lane configurations;
    2) Adjusting the signal timing while keeping the existing lane configurations; and
    3) Adjusting the signal timing and lane configurations.

1.3.2.1 No-Build Scenario 1: Kept existing signal timing and existing lane configurations
In Scenario 1, the signal timing and roadway lane configurations assumed for 2020 models would be the
same as the existing conditions. Figure 4 shows the LOS and key findings of No-Build Scenario 1. See
Appendix C for the detailed MOE results for the 2020 No-Build Scenario 1 from VISSIM analysis.

As shown in the results, several signalized and un-signalized intersections experience level-of-service
downgrades in 2020 No-Build when they are compared with the existing conditions. During the AM peak
hour, the level of service for the intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar Street downgrades from C to E.
The westbound approach experiences LOS F with more than 1,500 feet length of queue. The intersection
of Piney Branch Road and Blair Road downgrades from LOS D to F. Both westbound and eastbound
approaches on Blair Road experience significant delays where the westbound Blair Road approach is 423
seconds delay per vehicle in the AM peak hour. The westbound queue on Blair Road extends to the
upstream intersection of Cedar Street, Blair Road and 4th Street, resulting in significant delays and
queues at that intersection. The intersection of Cedar Street, Blair Road and 4th Street also operates with
LOS F.

The PM traffic conditions are similar to the AM with the exception of the following intersections:
    1. Eastern Avenue at Holly Avenue,
    2. Eastern Avenue at Kiss & Ride and
    3. Eastern Avenue at Bus Access intersections.
The level of service at the intersection 1 and 2 is downgraded to LOS F and intersection 3 is downgraded
to LOS E. The major cause of this level of service downgrade is due to the long queues on the
westbound Eastern Avenue not yielding to the side street traffic.

In summary, the existing signal operation and facilities are not able to provide adequate capacity for
future traffic growth in the region. A potential remedy would be adjusting signal timing and improving lane
configurations.

1.3.2.2 No-Build Scenario 2: Adjusted signal timing and kept existing lane configurations
In Scenario 2, the split time (green time) at four signalized study intersections were optimized while
keeping the cycle length at 100 seconds, which is the same as the existing conditions. The green signal
time provided for Blair Road is extended in the AM peak hour to reduce the approach delay and the green
signal time provided for Piney Branch Road is reduced to keep the overall cycle length to 100 seconds.
The signal timing changes would keep the LOS for Piney Branch Road at an acceptable level. As is
shown in Appendix C, in the existing condition, the LOS at Piney Branch Road approaches is B. Figure 5
shows the key findings and LOS of No-Build Scenario 2.See Appendix C for the detailed MOE summary
for the 2020 No-Build Scenario 2 from VISSIM analysis.

As compared to the results in Scenario 1, Scenario 2 shows an improvement in traffic operation in the AM
peak hour. During the AM peak hour, the intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar Street improves from
LOS E in Scenario 1 to LOS D in Scenario 2, but westbound Carroll Street still has 1,500 feet-long
queues. Similar improvements were observed at the intersection of Blair Road and Piney Branch Road
where the LOS improves from F to E. Due to this improvement, the intersection of Cedar Street, Blair
Road and 4th Street also improves from LOS F to D.

During the PM peak hour, the LOS for un-signalized intersections along Eastern Avenue improves from
LOS F to D or better by adjusting signal timing at the intersection of Piney Branch Road and Eastern

Avenue. The signalized intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar Street also improves from LOS E to C.
However, the intersection of Cedar Street, Blair Road and 4th Street, and the intersection of Piney Branch
road and Blair Road continue to operate with LOS F in Scenario 2. This indicates that adjusting the signal
timing at these intersections does not essentially address the congestion problems along Piney Branch
Road and Blair Road.

In summary, traffic operation in the AM is greatly improved by adjusting signal timing at four signalized
intersections. However, optimizing signal timing does not improve the traffic operation at two signalized
intersections in the PM.

1.3.2.3 No-Build Scenario 3: Adjusted signal timing and improved lane configurations
In Scenario 2, the major operational problem in the AM peak hour is the excessive queue on westbound
Carroll Street and the two signalized intersections operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour. The proposed
lane configuration improvement to solve the AM operational problem is to provide additional 100 foot long
westbound right-turn lane (pocket) on Carroll Street approaching Cedar Street intersection. For the PM
peak hour, the proposed improvements are to restrict parking during peak hours and convert the curb-
side parking lane into a travel lane on northbound Piney Branch Road between Dahlia Street and Eastern
Avenue. The proposed Piney Branch Road improvements will increase capacity to Piney Branch Road
approach. This improvement in turn creates an opportunity to reallocate green time from Piney Branch

Figure 7 shows the assumptions of improvements, key findings and LOS of No-Build Scenario 3.See
Appendix C for the detailed MOE VISSIM analysis summary result for the 2020 No-Build Scenario 3. As
shown in the results, the westbound right-turn pocket at the intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar Street
helps reduce the westbound queues and improves the overall intersection level of service from D to B
during the AM peak hour. The westbound queue length also decreases from 1,500 feet to approximately
400 feet. The proposed lane configurations along Piney Branch Road help alleviate traffic delays along
Blair Road and improve the operation at the intersection of Piney Branch Road and Blair Road from LOS
F to D, and at the intersection of Blair Road, 4th Street and Cedar Street from LOS F to E.

1.4 2020 Build Volume Projections
1.4.1    Development Plan
A new residential building on a site shared with a Metro Kiss & Ride and short-term parking facility is
proposed at the Takoma Metro Station. The new residential building would include 212 apartment units
and 190 parking spaces (excluding Kiss & Ride and short-term parking for the Metro). The conceptual site
plan is shown in Figure 8.

1.4.2    Trip Generation
The ITE Trip Generation Manual 9th Edition was used to estimate the generated trips from the proposed
development at the Takoma Metro Station. Table 2 shows the land use type and trip generation
rates/equations used to estimate total generated trips. Table 3 shows the calculated site-generated trips
including transit, walk/bike and vehicular trips.

1.4.3   Mode Share
Transit and walk/bike trips were not considered for purposes of trip generation calculation, although they
are accounted for in the final Build analysis and evaluation. The 2005 Development-Related Ridership
Survey conducted by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) studies the travel
behavior of persons traveling to and from office, residential, hotel and retail sites near Metrorail stations in
the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.

For residential trips, the 2005 Survey investigates the mode share for residential sites within ¼ mile
walking distance at a variety of Metro stations. The average mode share at these Metro stations is listed
as follows:
    • 11% walk/bike trips
    • 48% transit trips
    • 41% vehicle trips
This study assumes the same mode share to estimate the vehicular trips at the Takoma Metro Station.
Table 4 presents the total vehicular trips entering and exiting the development sites during the AM and
PM peak hour.

1.4.4   Trip Distribution
The future new development site would share the same access intersection/driveway with the Metro Kiss
& Ride and short-term parking trips. The distribution of the generated vehicular trips at the access
intersection is assumed to follow the same traffic pattern as the vehicles coming from Holly Avenue. The
distribution is comparable because the trips from Holly Avenue are also residential trips. The existing
traffic distribution was used as a guide for determining the trip distribution at other intersections. Figures 9
and 10 show the trip distribution for the new generated trips in the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.

1.4.5   Analysis Results
2020 Build models assume the same lane configurations as 2020 No-Build Scenario 3. Signal timings
were adjusted to accommodate the site generated trips. Figure 11 shows the assumptions of
improvements, key findings and LOS of Build Condition. See Appendix C for the detailed delay and LOS
results for 2020 Build scenarios. All intersections are operating at the acceptable level of service.
Table 5 shows a summary of LOS at the study intersections in each scenario. The detailed results are
included in Appendix C.

1.5 Summary
The study investigates the existing 2020 No-Build and 2020 Build traffic conditions at the Takoma Metro
Station. In the existing conditions, westbound and eastbound Blair Road experience long delays when
approaching Piney Branch Road in both AM and PM. The congestion is caused by the insufficient signal
green time provided for traffic on Blair Road. In the existing condition, westbound Carroll Street and
southbound Piney Branch Road have long traffic queues in the AM peak hour. The northbound Piney
Branch Road have long traffic queues during the PM peak period. However, the queues were cleared
during most cycles.

2020 No-Build assumes an annual traffic growth rate of 2% to a total growth of 15% from the year 2013 to
2020. However, the existing signal operation and facilities are not able to provide adequate capacity to
handle the future traffic growth in the region. Several intersections show LOS F in the AM and PM peak
hours. Proposed improvements for 2020 No-Build conditions include signal timing optimization and lane
configuration improvement. Lane configuration improvements include 1) adding a 100 foot long right-turn
pocket on westbound Carroll Street approaching Cedar Street intersection; and 2) converting the curb
side parking lane on northbound Piney Branch Road into a travel lane between Dahlia Street and Eastern
Avenue. The results indicate the traffic operation will improve with the proposed recommendations and all
the intersections will operate with LOS E or better. The proposed lane configuration would be used for the
Build analysis and evaluation.

In 2020 Build conditions, the additional vehicular trips from the development sites are 44 and 54 vehicles
in the AM and PM, respectively. The vehicles were distributed to the network by following the existing
traffic pattern. The results indicate that the additional trips would slightly impact the traffic operation along
Eastern Avenue, whereas at two un-signalized intersections, LOS downgrades from C to D. However,
these intersections would still operate at an acceptable level of service condition.

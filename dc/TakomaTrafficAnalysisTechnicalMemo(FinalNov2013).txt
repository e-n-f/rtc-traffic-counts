1.0     INTRODUCTION
The Takoma Metro Station is located on the Red Line in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
System. It serves the area of Takoma Park, Maryland and the Takoma neighborhood of Washington D.C.
A new residential apartment development is being proposed at the existing Kiss & Ride site to the
northeast of the station. The purpose of this technical memorandum is to document the existing traffic
conditions in the vicinity of the Takoma Metro Station, and also assess the traffic impacts from the
proposed Joint Development for its projected opening date of the year 2020. This technical memorandum
is organized in the following manner:
    ·   Study Area and Intersections
    ·   Existing Conditions
    ·   2020 No-Build Conditions
    ·   2020 Build Conditions

1.1 Study Area and Intersections
The Takoma Metro Station is located immediately south of DC-Maryland borderline. It is bounded by
Cedar Street to the east, Piney Branch Road to the west, Eastern Avenue to the north, and Blair Road
and Cedar Street to the south.
The studied intersections include four signalized intersections and five un-signalized intersections, listed
as follows:
        1. Eastern Avenue and Piney Branch Road (signalized)
        2. Eastern Avenue and Holly Avenue (un-signalized)
        3. Eastern Avenue and Kiss & Ride Facility (un-signalized)
        4. Eastern Avenue and Bus Access (un-signalized)
        5. Eastern Avenue and Cedar Street (un-signalized)
        6. Carroll Street and Cedar Street (signalized)
        7. Carroll Street and Bus Access (un-signalized)
        8. Cedar Street and Blair Road and 4th Street (signalized)
        9. Blair Road and Piney Branch Road (signalized)

Figure 1 shows the study area, study intersections, and locations of the proposed development site at the
Takoma Metro Station.

1.2 Existing Conditions
This section presents the existing traffic conditions on the roadways adjacent to project and the purpose
of this analysis is to establish the base conditions.

1.2.1   Field Observation
Field observations were performed in the study area during the AM and PM peak periods. The purpose of
these field visits was to investigate the existing roadway and geometric conditions, traffic control
operations, pedestrian/bicycle activities, and transit operations. These factors could affect the traffic
operations at the study intersections.

1.2.1.1 Traffic
The major congestion within the study area is observed at the intersection of Blair Road and Piney
Branch Road. Vehicles experience long delays along eastbound and westbound Blair Road approaching
Piney Branch Road during both AM and PM peak hours. The westbound queues on Blair Road spill back
to Cedar Street, and the eastbound queues extend beyond Fern Place in the AM and PM. One major
cause of the congestion is the insufficient duration of the green time at Piney Branch Road and Blair
Road traffic signalized operation. Since there is only one travel lane on Blair Road, left-turning or right-
turning vehicles were observed blocking the though traffic in some cycles. However, the Blair Road traffic
queues do not block vehicles coming from the adjacent side streets such as Dahlia Street or Chestnut
Street.

Long queues were also observed on the following approaches:
     · Southbound Piney Branch Road approaching Eastern Avenue in the AM peak hour
     · Northbound Piney Branch Road approaching Blair Road in the PM peak hour and on
     · Westbound Carroll Street approaching Cedar Street in the AM peak hour.
However, these queues were cleared during most cycles. All other signalized and un-signalized
intersections are operating at acceptable conditions.

1.2.1.2 Bus Operation
The Takoma Metro Station is served by WMATA's Metrobus and Montgomery County's Ride-On Bus
service. There are 16 bus lines serving the station during the AM and PM peak hours. There are 9 bus
bays provided at the station while 1 bay is currently not assigned to any bus route. WMATA buses
including bus routes 52/53/54, F1/F2, K2 and 62/63 use 4 bus bays, and Ride On buses including Lines
3, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 24, 25 use the other 4 bus bays. Despite the fact that the two bus-access
intersections are un-signalized, buses currently do not appear to encounter any problem in entering and
exiting the station.

1.2.1.3 Park and Ride and Kiss and Ride
There are no long-term Park and Ride facilities provided at the Takoma Metro Station. The Kiss & Ride
and short-term parking lots are located to the northeast of the metro station. No congestion or
overcrowding was observed at the Kiss & Ride/Short-term parking lots. Informal drop-off and pickup also
occurs on Cedar Street adjacent to the station entrance. However, these vehicles do not create traffic
congestion.

1.2.1.4 Pedestrians
Sidewalk is provided on all the streets within the study area. Heavy pedestrian activity was observed on
Carroll Street, Blair Road and Eastern Avenue.

1.2.1.5 Bicycle
According to the 2012 bike parking census, the Takoma Metro Station has the second-highest number of
bike users in the Metro system. Many bicyclists were observed along Blair Road, Piney Branch Road,
Eastern Avenue, and Carroll Street. However, no bike lanes are provided on any of these corridors.
Cyclists either ride on the curb-side parking lane, or share the travel lane with cars.


1.2.2   Data Collection
Turning movement counts at study intersections were collected in mid-September, 2013 during the AM
peak period (6:00 a.m. ­ 10:00 a.m.), and PM peak period (3:00 p.m. ­ 7:00 p.m.). According to the data
reports, the peak hour is between 7:45 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. in the morning, and between 5:30 p.m. and
6:30 p.m. in the afternoon. The highest hourly traffic volumes were used for AM and PM peak hour traffic
analysis. Appendix A includes turning movement counts collected from the field.
Signal timing at signalized study intersections was provided by District Department of Transportation
(DDOT). Appendix B shows the signal timing sheets.

1.2.3   Methodology
A traffic analysis was performed for the study intersections using the micro-simulation tool VISSIM. Traffic
operation was assessed using Measures of Effectiveness (MOE), including Delay (seconds per vehicle),
Level of Service (LOS), and queue length (feet) at the study intersections.

Intersection LOS analysis provides a measurement of delay and service conditions for all approaches to
the intersection. The HCM 2010 edition uses LOS as a qualitative measure to describe the operating
conditions at signalized and un-signalized intersections based on control delay per vehicle (seconds). The
LOS range of A through F represents driving conditions from best to worst. Table 1 presents the LOS
thresholds for signalized and un-signalized intersections per the HCM 2010.

            > 80                  F                > 50                F

The VISSIM models were run 20 times, and the average output results were tabulated and analyzed to
determine the overall conditions at the study intersections during the AM and PM peak hours. In order to
replicate the existing peak hour traffic conditions at study intersections, the AM and PM peak hour models
were calibrated based on field data and observations.

1.2.4   Analysis Results
This section summarizes the delay, LOS and queue results from VISSIM at each study intersection during
AM and PM peak hours. See Appendix C for the MOE summary for the existing AM and PM peak hour
conditions from VISSIM analysis.

The results indicate that the VISSIM outputs are consistent with field observations. Vehicles on Blair
Road approaching Piney Branch Road experience LOS E and LOS F in both AM and PM peak periods.
The westbound queues on Blair Road starting at Piney Branch spill back beyond Cedar Street, which
makes westbound vehicles approaching Cedar Street experience LOS E and F in the AM and PM,
respectively.

Northbound Piney Branch Road has long queues in the PM peak hour approaching Blair Road
intersection. The 95th-percentile queue on northbound Piney Branch Road is approximately 1,100 feet
long.

1.3 2020 No-Build Conditions
2020 No-Build represents the background traffic condition in 2020 excluding the proposed joint
developments at the Takoma Metro Station. 2020 was selected as the analysis year because that is the
date the development is planned to open.

1.3.1   No-Build Volume Projections
MWCOG 2.3 model was used to project the traffic growth from 2013 to 2020 (excluding the development
at the Takoma Metro Station). MWCOG model indicates that three of the local jurisdictions including
Washington D,C., Prince George's County, and Montgomery County are showing more than 10% total
increase in households and employment from 2010 to 2020. Silver Spring, which is located to the
northeast of the Takoma Metro Station, expects significant growth in both jobs and number of residents.
This study, assumed a total growth of 15% from 2013 to 2030 in the AM and PM peak period that is
equivalent to an annual traffic growth rate of 2%.

1.3.2   No-Build Analysis Results
Due to the traffic growth through 2020, the existing signal timing or roadway alignment may potentially fail
to support the future traffic volumes. Note that this would be the case even if the proposed WMATA joint
development project is not implemented. Several scenarios were tested to assess the future traffic
conditions and to potentially improve the traffic operations for 2020 No-Build, including:
    1) Keeping the existing signal timing and lane configurations;
    2) Adjusting the signal timing while keeping the existing lane configurations; and
    3) Adjusting the signal timing and lane configurations.

1.3.2.1 No-Build Scenario 1: Kept existing signal timing and existing lane configurations
In Scenario 1, the signal timing and roadway lane configurations assumed for 2020 models would be the
same as the existing conditions. See Appendix C for the detailed MOE results for the 2020 No-Build
Scenario 1 from VISSIM analysis.

As shown in the results, several signalized and un-signalized intersections experience level-of-service
downgrades in 2020 No-Build when they are compared with the existing conditions. During the AM peak
hour, the level of service for the intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar Street downgrades from C to E.
The westbound approach experiences LOS F with more than 1,500 feet length of queue. The intersection
of Piney Branch Road and Blair Road downgrades from LOS D to F. Both westbound and eastbound
approaches on Blair Road experience significant delays. The westbound queue on Blair Road extends to
the upstream intersection of Cedar Street, Blair Road and 4th Street, resulting in significant delays and
queues at this upstream intersection. The intersection of Cedar Street, Blair road and 4th Street also
operates with LOS F. The westbound Blair Road approach experiences significant delays of 423 seconds
per vehicle in the AM peak hour.

The PM traffic conditions are similar to the AM. Apart from three signalized intersections level of service
downgrading to LOS E or F, several un-signalized intersections along Eastern Avenue also downgrade to
LOS E or F. The major cause is the queues on eastbound Eastern Avenue at Piney Branch Road is
blocking the vehicles from the side streets, causing long delays on the side streets.

In summary, the existing signal operation and facilities are not able to provide adequate capacity for
future traffic growth in the region. A potential remedy would be adjusting signal timing and improving lane
configurations.

1.3.2.2 No-Build Scenario 2: Adjusted signal timing and kept existing lane configurations
In Scenario 2, signal timing at four signalized study intersections were optimized for the purpose of
reducing the average vehicle delay. The cycle length remains 100 seconds, which is the same as the
existing conditions. For example, the green signal time provided for Blair Road is extended in the AM
peak hour to reduce the approach delay while keeping the LOS on Piney Branch Road at an acceptable

level. See Appendix C for the detailed MOE summary for the 2020 No-Build Scenario 2 from VISSIM
analysis.

As compared to the results in Scenario 1, Scenario 2 shows an improvement in traffic operation in the AM
peak hour. During the AM peak hour, the intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar Street improves from
LOS E in Scenario 1 to LOS D in Scenario 2, but westbound Carroll Street still has 1,500 feet-long
queues. Similar improvements were observed at the intersection of Blair Road and Piney Branch Road
where the LOS improves from F to E. Due to this improvement, the intersection of Cedar Street, Blair
Road and 4th Street also improves from LOS F to D.

During the PM peak hour, the LOS for un-signalized intersections along Eastern Avenue improves from
LOS F to D or better by adjusting signal timing at the intersection of Piney Branch Road and Eastern
Avenue. The signalized intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar Street also improves from LOS E to C.
However, the intersection of Cedar Street, Blair Road and 4th Street, and the intersection of Piney Branch
road and Blair Road continue to operate with LOS F in Scenario 2. This indicates that adjusting the signal
timing at these intersections does not essentially address the congestion problems along Piney Branch
Road and Blair Road.

In summary, traffic operation in the AM is greatly improved by adjusting signal timing at four signalized
intersections. However, optimizing signal timing does not improve the traffic operation at two signalized
intersections in the PM.

1.3.2.3 No-Build Scenario 3: Adjusted signal timing and improved lane configurations
In Scenario 2, the major operational problem in the AM peak hour is the excessive queue on westbound
Carroll Street and the two signalized intersections operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour. The proposed
lane configuration improvement to solve the AM operational problem is to provide additional 100 foot long
westbound right-turn lane (pocket) on Carroll Street approaching Cedar Street intersection. For the PM
peak hour, the proposed improvement is to restrict parking during peak hours and convert the curb-side
parking lane into a travel lane on northbound Piney Branch Road between Dahlia Street and Eastern
Avenue. The proposed improvement provides an additional capacity to Piney Branch Road which will in
turn improve the capacity of Blair Road intersection by providing more green time to Blair Road. Figure 2
shows the existing and proposed lane configurations for the year 2020 on Piney Branch Road.
See Appendix C for the detailed MOE VISSIM analysis summary result for the 2020 No-Build Scenario 3.
As shown in the results, the westbound right-turn pocket at the intersection of Carroll Street and Cedar
Street helps reduce the westbound queues and improves the overall intersection level of service from D
to B during the AM peak hour. The westbound queue length also decreases from 1,500 feet to
approximately 400 feet. The proposed lane configurations along Piney Branch Avenue help alleviate
traffic delays along Blair Road and improve the operation at the intersection of Piney Branch Avenue and
Blair Road from LOS F to D, and at the intersection of Blair Road, 4th Street and Cedar Street from LOS
F to E.

1.4 2020 Build Volume Projections
1.4.1    Development Plan
A new residential building on a site shared with a Metro Kiss & Ride and short-term parking facility is
proposed at the Takoma Metro Station. The new residential building would include 212 apartment units
and 190 parking spaces (excluding Kiss & Ride and short-term parking for the metro). The conceptual site
plan is shown in Figure 3.

1.4.2    Trip Generation
The ITE Trip Generation Manual 9th Edition was used to estimate the generated trips from the proposed
development at the Takoma Metro Station. Table 2 shows the land use type and trip generation
rates/equations used to estimate total generated trips. Table 3 shows the calculated site-generated trips
including transit, walk/bike and vehicular trips.

1.4.3   Mode Share
Transit and walk/bike trips were not considered for purposes of trip generation calculation, although they
are accounted for in the final Build analysis and evaluation. The 2005 Development-Related Ridership
Survey conducted by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) studies the travel
behavior of persons traveling to and from office, residential, hotel and retail sites near Metrorail stations in
the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.

For residential trips, the 2005 Survey investigates the mode share for residential sites within ¼ mile
walking distance at a variety of metro stations. The average mode share at these metro stations is listed
as follows:
    · 11% walk/bike trips
    · 48% transit trips
    · 41% vehicle trips
This study assumes the same mode share to estimate the vehicular trips at the Takoma Metro Station.
Table 4 presents the total vehicular trips entering and exiting the development sites during the AM and
PM peak hour.

1.4.4   Trip Distribution
The future new development site would share the same access intersection/driveway with the metro Kiss
& Ride and short-term parking trips. The distribution of the generated vehicular trips at the access
intersection is assumed to follow the same traffic pattern as the vehicles coming from Holly Avenue. The
distribution is comparable because the trips from Holly Avenue are also residential trips. The existing
traffic distribution was used as a guide for determining the trip distribution at other intersections. Figures 4
and 5 show the trip distribution for the new generated trips in the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.

1.4.5   Analysis Results
2020 Build models assume the same lane configurations as 2020 No-Build Scenario 3. Signal timings
were adjusted to accommodate the site generated trips. See Appendix C for the detailed delay and LOS
results for 2020 Build scenarios. As compared to the 2020 No-Build Scenario 3, the intersection of Holly
Avenue and Eastern Avenue downgrades from LOS C to D in the AM peak hour. The intersection of the
Kiss & Ride entrance/exit and Eastern Avenue also downgrades from LOS C to D in both AM and PM due
to the additional trips added to the network. However, these intersections still operate at an acceptable
level of service condition. Table 5 shows a summary of LOS at the study intersections in each scenario.
The detailed results are included in Appendix C.

1.5 Summary
The study investigates the existing 2020 No-Build and 2020 Build traffic conditions at the Takoma Metro
Station. In the existing conditions, westbound and eastbound Blair Road experience long delays when
approaching Piney Branch Road in both AM and PM. The congestion is caused by the insufficient signal
green time provided for traffic on Blair Road. In the existing condition, westbound Carroll Street and
southbound Piney Branch Road have long traffic queues in the AM peak hour. The northbound Piney
Branch Road have long traffic queues during the PM peak period. However, the queues were cleared
during most cycles.

2020 No-Build assumes an annual traffic growth rate of 2% to a total growth of 15% from the year 2013 to
2030. However, the existing signal operation and facilities are not able to provide adequate capacity to
handle the future traffic growth in the region. Several intersections show LOS F in the AM and PM peak
hours. Proposed improvements for 2020 No-Build conditions include signal timing optimization and lane
configuration improvement. Lane configuration improvements include 1) adding a 100 foot long right-turn
pocket on westbound Carroll Street approaching Cedar Street intersection; and 2) converting the curb
side parking lane on northbound Piney Branch Road into a travel lane between Dahlia Street and Eastern
Avenue. The results indicate the traffic operation will improve with the proposed recommendations and all
the intersections will operate with LOS E or better. The proposed lane configuration would be used for the
Build analysis and evaluation.

In 2020 Build conditions, the additional vehicular trips from the development sites are 44 and 54 vehicles
in the AM and PM, respectively. The vehicles were distributed to the network by following the existing
traffic pattern. The results indicate that the additional trips would slightly impact the traffic operation along
Eastern Avenue, whereas at two un-signalized intersections, LOS downgrades from C to D. However,
these intersections would still operate at an acceptable level of service condition.

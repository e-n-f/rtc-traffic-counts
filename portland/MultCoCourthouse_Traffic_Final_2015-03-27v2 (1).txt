1. PURPOSE AND STUDY AREA
Multnomah County is working to identify a location for a new county central courthouse. The
existing courthouse is located in downtown Portland at 1021 Southwest 4 th Avenue. As part of
the selection process to identify a preferred location for the new courthouse, Multnomah
County has identified two potential locations in downtown Portland:

        Hawthorne Bridgehead Site: located at the west end of the Hawthorne bridge on the block
         between SW 1st Avenue and SW Naito Parkway , and SW Madison and SW Jefferson Streets
        Block 128 Site: located on the block between SW 1st and SW 2nd Avenues, and SW Columbia and
         SW Clay Streets

This memorandum will discuss the traffic analysis completed to evaluate the transportation
impacts associated with each site. The analysis included a PM peak hour operations analysis,
building access driveway evaluation and determination of implications to pedestrian, transit,
and bicycle operations and safety.

In order to capture the impacts of each site, 11 intersections were selected within the area of
SW Market Street on the south, SW Madison Street on the north, SW 2nd Avenue on the west,
and SW Naito Parkway on the east. The 11 study area intersections are:

    1.   SW Madison Street at SW 2nd Avenue                     6.    SW Columbia Street at SW 2nd Avenue
    2.   SW Madison Street at SW 1st Avenue                     7.    SW Columbia Street at SW 1st Avenue
    3.   SW Jefferson Street at SW 2nd Avenue                   8.    SW Clay Street at SW 2nd Avenue
    4.   SW Jefferson Street at SW 1st Avenue                   9.    SW Clay Street at SW 1st Avenue
    5.   SW Jefferson Street at SW Naito                        10.   SW Market Street at SW 1st Avenue
         Parkway                                                11.   SW Market Street at SW Naito Parkway

Figure 1 shows the study area and the 11 study area intersections located in downtown
Portland.

2. FINDINGS
The results of the transportation analysis indicate that neither the Hawthorne Bridgehead nor
Block 128 sites have fatal flaws with respect to transportation. There are unique transportation
challenges for each site; however, there are no significant transportation concerns at either
location. The overall traffic operations, bicycle, pedestrian, transit, and parking considerations
for each site are comparable and do not preclude either site from consideration.

3. ANALYSIS ALTERNATIVES
Multnomah County has identified two potential locations in downtown Portland where the new
county central courthouse could be sited. Each location is described in further detail below.

Hawthorne Bridgehead
The Hawthorne Bridgehead site is enclosed by SW Madison Street on the north, SW Jefferson
Street on the south, SW 1st Avenue on the west, and SW Naito Parkway on the east. The site is
accessible by all means of transportation including pedestrian, bicycle, auto, bus, and MAX.
Traffic circulation around this site would be unchanged from what it is today. This site would
have access to an existing garage near the site for public parking and possible secure judge
parking. The new courthouse will provide a Sally Port for secure prisoner transfers, with
vehicles entering from southbound SW Naito Parkway and exiting onto SW Jefferson Street.

Block 128
The Block 128 site is enclosed by SW Columbia Street on the north, SW Clay Street on the
south, SW 2nd Avenue on the west, and SW 1st Avenue on the east. The site is accessible by all
means of transportation including pedestrian, bicycle, auto, bus, and MAX. Traffic circulation
around this site would be unchanged from what it is today. This site would have access to an
existing garage near the site for public parking. The new courthouse will provide a Sally Port for
secure prisoner transfers, with vehicles entering from southbound SW 2nd Avenue and exiting
onto SW Columbia Street.

4. TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
This section provides the methodology and overview of the transportation analysis. The
transportation analysis provides a discussion of existing traffic volumes, the opening year traffic
estimates, assumptions for the projected opening year volumes, and a summary of traffic
operations. The traffic operations analysis for each of the traffic alignments discussed above
was performed on an assumed opening year of 2020.

Existing Traffic Volumes
The existing traffic count data included number of vehicles, vehicle classifications, and bicycle
and pedestrian volumes. Traffic volume data collected for this project consisted of PM peak
hour intersection turn movement counts collected on Thursday, February 26, 2015 from 4:00 to
6:00 PM.

The turning movement counts were examined to determine the common weekday PM peak
hours among the intersections based on the hour with the highest total volume of vehicles on
the network. The common peak hour for the intersections was determined to be 4:45 to
5:45 PM. While the peak hour at each intersection may or may not correspond with the
common peak hour, all individual peak hours overlap with at least a portion of the common

Transportation Alternatives Analysis Technical Memorandum                                              Final


peak hour. Figure 2 shows the PM peak hour volumes collected. Detailed traffic count data can
be seen in Appendix A.

Mode Split
A Central Courthouse Community Survey was conducted by Multnomah County between
August 27, 2014 and November 17, 2014. The survey focused on a variety of topics including
how users travel to the existing courthouse. The survey found that approximately 38% of all
responders travel to the courthouse by motor vehicle (drive or carpool). Twenty-one percent of
all responders use transit, four percent bicycle, and 37% walk to the courthouse. Mode split for
the new courthouse is not expected to change significantly as a result of relocating the
courthouse to either of the proposed sites.

Opening Year Traffic Volumes
Opening year for the new courthouse was assumed to be 2020. To estimate 2020 traffic
volumes, PM peak hour turn movements were projected using a linear growth rate of one
percent. Figure 3 shows the PM peak hour volumes for the opening year of 2020. Calculations
used to grow existing 2015 volumes to opening year 2020 volumes can be found in Appendix B.

For developing opening year (2020) volumes it was assumed that the relocated courthouse will
add no net new vehicular trips to the overall downtown network, eliminating the need for a
baseline versus build scenario analysis. The new courthouse is expected to feature similar
numbers of employees and courtrooms; however, the new courthouse will not have four (4)
high volume courtrooms (parking citations, other violations (primarily traffic citations), Small Claims, and
Landlord-Tenant (FED) cases which are major trip generator for the current courthouse. The
comparable numbers of employees and courts suggest that the current trips generated by the
existing courthouse will simply be diverted to the new location a few blocks southeast of the
current site and are not new trips to the downtown network. Furthermore, the lack of high
volume courts in the new courthouse indicates that trips generated by the existing traffic courts
will not be diverted to the new site at all. The total trips traveling to the new courthouse are
not anticipated to exceed the number of existing trips.

For the majority of courthouse employees and visitors traveling to the courthouse from the
west side, routes to the two proposed courthouse locations will be mostly unchanged. For
employees and visitors traveling from the east side, slight shifts in trips across the Willamette
River bridges may be experienced due to the relocation of the courthouse a few blocks to the
south. It is assumed general PM peak hour travel patterns to the new sites will reflect typical
downtown travel patterns and result in no change in traffic volumes. Travel patterns to the two
proposed sites are likely to be very similar due to their close proximity to each other and the
existing site. To quantify any potential shifts in traffic patterns and volumes that may occur at
either of the proposed sites would require a detailed trip generation study of the existing
courthouse.

Traffic Operations Overview
Operational Criteria
Transportation engineers have established various methods for measuring traffic operations of
roadways and intersections. Most jurisdictions use either volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio or level
of service (LOS) to establish performance criteria. Both the LOS and v/c ratio concepts require
consideration of factors that include traffic demand, capacity of the intersection or roadway,
delay, frequency of interruptions in traffic flow, relative freedom for traffic maneuvers, driving
comfort, convenience, and operating cost.

Volume-to-Capacity (v/c) Ratio
A comparison of traffic volume demand to intersection capacity is one method of evaluating
how well an intersection is operating. This comparison is presented as a v/c ratio. A v/c ratio of
less than 1.00 indicates that the volume is less than capacity. When the v/c ratio is closer to
zero, traffic conditions are generally good, with little congestion and low delays for most
intersection movements. As the v/c ratio approaches 1.00, traffic becomes more congested and
unstable, with longer delays.

Level of Service (LOS)
LOS is also a widely recognized and accepted measure and descriptor of traffic operations. At
both STOP-controlled and signalized intersections, LOS is a function of control delay, which
includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration
delay. Six standards have been established, ranging from LOS A, where there is little or no
delay, to LOS F, where there is delay of more than 50 seconds at unsignalized intersections, or
more than 80 seconds at signalized intersections. Table 1 illustrates the level of service criteria
for signalized and unsignalized intersections according to the Highway Capacity Manual.

It should be noted that, although delays can sometimes be long for some movements at a
STOP-controlled intersection, the v/c ratio may indicate that there is adequate capacity to
process the demand for that movement. Similarly, at signalized intersections, some

movements, particularly side street approaches or left turns onto side streets, may experience
longer delays because they receive only a small portion of the green time during a signal cycle,
but their v/c ratio may be relatively low. For these reasons, it is important to examine both v/c
ratio and LOS when evaluating overall intersection operations. Both are reported in the
following section.

Operational Guidelines
The City of Portland uses a performance guideline based on LOS. The Portland Bureau of
Transportation (PBOT) Transportation System Plan (TSP) states that signalized intersections
must meet LOS D. Unsignalized intersections are required to operate at LOS E. In addition, the
City of Portland has a practice not to reduce the portal capacity into downtown. This means
that additional queuing or increased delay that would reduce the number of vehicles entering
into downtown would be unacceptable.

Traffic Operations Analysis Procedures
All operations were evaluated using the methodology outlined in the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM). The Synchro/SimTraffic analysis software was selected for performing the
intersection analysis, since it can provide the v/c ratio and LOS output of an HCM analysis as
well as consider the systematic interaction of the intersections with regard to queuing and
delays.

Synchro is a macroscopic model similar to the Highway Capacity Software (HCS), and like the
HCS, is based on the 2000 HCM. The Synchro model explicitly evaluates traffic operations under
coordinated and uncoordinated systems of signalized and unsignalized intersections. The v/c
ratios and LOS presented in this report are based on the Synchro model output.

Signal Timing
The downtown signal system is currently operating with a 60-second cycle length during the PM
peak hour. All signals along SW 1st Avenue and SW 2nd Avenue are two-phase signals. The
signals at the intersection of Jefferson Street at Naito Parkway and Market Street and Naito
Parkway are actuated coordinated signals with a 90-second cycle lengths. It was assumed that
the cycle lengths and splits would remain unchanged for the traffic operations analysis.

5. OPENING YEAR 2020 TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Opening year 2020 traffic operations were evaluated for both of the potential sites based on
background growth of the existing peak hour volumes. The following section describes the
expected traffic operations on the network surrounding the two sites.

2020 Hawthorne Bridgehead Site Operations
Traffic operations near the Hawthorne Bridgehead site are represented by study area
intersections one through five between SW 1st and SW 2nd Avenues and SW Madison Street, SW
Jefferson Street, and SW Naito Parkway. All five study area intersections around this site are

expected to meet operational standards with an overall intersection LOS of D or better.
Operations at the intersections on the corners of the Bridgehead site all operate at a LOS B,
with the intersection of SW 2nd Avenue and SW Madison Street operating at LOS C. Although
within overall intersection standards, the northbound left from Naito Parkway to Jefferson
Street is projected to be overcapacity in the year 2020 PM peak hour. Traffic operations are
shown on Figure 4 and can be found in Appendix C.

2020 Block 128 Site Operations
Operations of the Block 128 site are represented by the performance of study area
intersections six through 11 between SW 1st and SW 2nd Avenues, SW Naito Parkway, and SW
Clay and SW Market Streets. Similar to the Hawthorne Bridgehead site, all of the intersections
surrounding the Block 128 site meet operational standards with an overall intersection LOS D or
better. Of the intersections directly adjacent to the site, the overall operations for signalized
intersections are LOS B or better. The unsignalized intersection of SW 2nd Avenue and SW Clay
Street has a STOP controlled through movement on SW 2nd Avenue that experiences LOS D;
however, the movement v/c ratio (0.58) indicates that the approach has adequate capacity.
Traffic operations are shown on Figure 4 and can be found in Appendix C.

There are no significant concerns or differences with traffic operations at the two proposed
sites.

6. PARKING CONSIDERATIONS
The existing courthouse has no parking on-site. The majority of parking for employees and
visitors is provided off-site through a variety of public parking lots and garages in the area.
Similar to the existing courthouse, the new courthouse will provide no parking. The majority of
parking for employees and those using the courthouse will be offsite. Due to the close
proximity of both preliminary sites, each site will have access to the same number of parking
spots provided by a variety of public parking lots and garages in the area. Figure 5 below shows
the parking availability in the vicinity of both the existing and proposed courthouse sites.

The on-street parking available around each site consists of paid parking for anywhere from 15-
minutes to 2-hours. At the Hawthorne Bridgehead site, the only available on-street parking is
along SW Jefferson Street. There is space for approximately four to five one-hour parking stalls
on the north side of SW Jefferson Street and two 15-minute parking stalls on the south side.

At the Block 128 site, there is parking provided along SW Clay Street, SW 1st Avenue, and SW 2nd
Avenue. Along SW Clay Street there is space for four two-hour parking stalls with additional
curb space dedicated for motorcycle parking on the north side, and space for five 90-minute
stalls and one 15-minute stall on the south side. Parking on SW 1st Avenue is only allowed on
the west side where there are five two-hour parking stalls. Parking on SW 2nd Avenue is located
on the west side where there are two 15-minute parking stalls. Building on Block 128 will
eliminate 150 off-street parking spots

While there is more on-street parking available directly adjacent to the Block 128 site, the
abundance of off-street parking and nearby on-street parking in close proximity to the two sites
indicates there are no significant concerns with parking at the two proposed sites.

7. PEDESTRIAN CONSIDERATIONS
Due to the lack of parking provided on-site, the majority of employees and visitors accessing
the site will be pedestrians, traveling to and from available parking resources or transit stops in
the vicinity. Pedestrian access to the sites will be from crosswalks at the existing intersections
adjacent to the Hawthorne Bridgehead and Block 128 sites. Pedestrian crossings will be
unchanged from today. The number of pedestrians using these intersections will increase with
addition of the new courthouse. Each site is discussed in more detail below.

Hawthorne Bridgehead
There are currently three intersections that front the Hawthorne Bridgehead site. Of these, the
intersections of SW Jefferson Street and SW Madison Street with SW 1st Avenue provide
crosswalks on the north, south, east, and west sides of the intersection. The intersection of SW
Jefferson Street with SW Naito Parkway has one crosswalk located on the west side of the
intersection crossing Jefferson. Because there are no pedestrian crossings of Naito Parkway at
Jefferson, pedestrians wishing to access the waterfront would have to walk out of direction to
cross SW Naito Parkway at SW Columbia Street, at SW Madison Street via the elevated
structure and stairwell, or at the crosswalk at the extension of SW Main Street. Current
pedestrian crossings in the area range from 25 to 250 pedestrian crossings per crosswalk in the
PM peak hour.

Drivers coming to the Hawthorne Bridgehead site would likely park in a garage to the west or
south of the site (see Figure 5 above). As a result, the two intersections along SW 1st Avenue
are likely to see an increase in the number of pedestrians crossing at these signals. This would
result in a reduction to vehicular capacity at these intersections and an increase in delay for
turning vehicles. Specifically, the dedicated eastbound right turn lane on SW Madison Street
approaching the intersection with SW 1st Avenue is likely to experience additional conflicting
pedestrian volumes crossing SW 1st Avenue towards the courthouse. Any increases in
pedestrian crossings are unlikely to cause significant enough delays to affect the overall
performance of the intersections as the right turn is a small fraction of the total intersection
volume. Also as a dedicated right-turn lane, queuing in that lane is less likely to impact the
adjacent through traffic lanes onto the Hawthorne Bridge.

Block 128
All four corners of Block 128 provide pedestrian crossings. The intersections of SW Columbia
Street at SW 1st Avenue, SW Columbia Street at SW 2nd Avenue, and SW Clay Street at SW 1st
Avenue have crosswalks on the north, south, east, and west sides of the intersections. The
intersection of SW Clay Street at SW 2nd Avenue does not provide a striped crosswalk on the

north side of the intersection. There are crosswalks on the south, east, and west side of the
intersection.

Drivers coming to the Block 128 site would likely park in a garage to the west, north, or south of
the site (see Figure 5 above). As a result, the two intersections along SW 2st Avenue and the
intersection of SW Clay Street at SW 1st Avenue are likely to see an increase in the number of
pedestrians crossing at these signals. Current pedestrian crossings are within 50 to 175
pedestrian crossings per crosswalk during the PM peak hour at these intersections. This would
result in a reduction to vehicular capacity at these intersections. An increase in conflicting
pedestrian movements are not anticipated to increase vehicular delay or reduce capacity to a
point where adjacent intersections fail to meet operational standards.

Pedestrian access at the proposed Block 128 site is slightly better than the Hawthorne
Bridgehead site due to the limited crossing of Naito Parkway. However, there are no significant
concerns with pedestrian access at the two proposed sites.

8. BICYCLE CONSIDERATIONS
Bicycling around the two sites would be unchanged from how cyclists currently use the road.
The number of cyclists riding to each site would increase with the new courthouse. Each site
will provide bike parking for employees and it is expected to be well utilized. Specifics for each
site are discussed below.

Hawthorne Bridgehead
Cyclists in downtown Portland are active users of the travel lane. Cyclists typically do not ride
on the sidewalks in downtown. For cyclists coming to the Hawthorne Bridgehead site from the
east side of the Willamette River via the Hawthorne Bridge would have to enter the travel lanes
from the raised multi-use path and cross two lanes of traffic to make a left on SW 1st Avenue.
As alternative to this movement, cyclists could take the designated bicycle and pedestrian exit
ramp from the bridge to the at-grade crossing of SW Naito Parkway at the striped crosswalk
north of the bridge. Cyclists heading east from the courthouse would be able to access SW
Madison Street from SW 1st Avenue and continue across the bike path on the Hawthorne
Bridge.

Cyclists on the west side of the Willamette River heading to or from the courthouse will
continue to use the downtown grid system. Currently, there is an eastbound right turn lane at
the intersection of SW Madison Street and SW 1st Avenue. It is expected that cyclists will use
this lane to turn right; however, this is also an active bus stop used by multiple routes. Buses
are permitted to go straight from the right turn lane through the intersection towards the
Hawthorne Bridge. The striped bike lane for this block is between the through lane and the
right turn lane. With the additional cyclists trying to reach the courthouse, this could increase
the potential for conflicts between cyclists trying to turn right in front of buses accessing the
Hawthorne Bridge from the curb-tight bus stop. When the Tilikum Crossing and new Sellwood
Bridge open, lines 31, 32, 33 and 99 will no longer stop at this bus stop.

Transportation Alternatives Analysis Technical Memorandum                                       Final


There is also a right turn lane along SW 1st Avenue at the intersection with SW Jefferson Street.
The bike lane is striped between the through and the right turn lane. Again, the increase in the
number of cyclists in this area may increase the potential for conflict between vehicles crossing
over the bike lane.

Block 128
Block 128 is surrounded by four one-way streets. Bicyclists heading to or from the courthouse
will continue to use the downtown grid system. There are no right turn lanes on the adjacent
roadways. Bicyclists are expected to be traveling in the vehicular lane or on the outside of
vehicular traffic. The building fronts along SW 1st Avenue and SW Clay Street currently have on
street parking. The increased number of cyclists will increase the number of parking/bicycle
conflicts surrounding the block.

Bicycle operations at the proposed Block 128 site is slightly better than the Hawthorne
Bridgehead site due more standard roadway grid and reduced bus conflict points. However,
there are no significant concerns with bicycle operations at the two proposed sites.

9. TRANSIT CONSIDERATIONS
Hawthorne Bridgehead
The Hawthorne Bridgehead site is currently serviced by 13 bus lines and is within five blocks of
the blue, red, green, and yellow MAX lines. Bus lines 4, 6, 10, 14, 31, 32, 33, and 99 all utilize
the Hawthorne Bridge and have stops along SW Madison and SW Main Streets. Lines 38, 45, 55,
92, and 96 run along SW Naito Parkway/SW Jefferson Street and SW Columbia Street/SW 1st
Avenue. When the Tilikum Crossing opens, lines 31, 32, and 33 will no longer service downtown
Portland. Current users would be expected to transfer to the MAX orange line. In addition, line
99 would be rerouted from the Hawthorne Bridge and moved to the Sellwood Bridge via
Macadam Avenue once the Sellwood Bridge opens to bus traffic. The rerouting of these four
bus lines will reduce bus frequency at the stop on Madison Street adjacent to the site.

Block 128
The Block 128 site is currently serviced by 13 bus lines within three blocks and is within six
blocks of the blue, red, green and yellow MAX lines. Bus lines 4, 6, 10, 14, 31, 32, 33, and 99 all
utilize the Hawthorne Bridge and have stops along SW Madison and SW Main Streets. Lines 38,
45, 55, 92, and 96 run along SW Naito Parkway/SW Jefferson Street and SW Columbia
Street/SW 1st Avenue.

Transit access at the proposed sites are similar. There are no significant concerns with transit
access at the two proposed sites.

10. SITE ACCESS CONSIDERATIONS
The only vehicle access provided to the new courthouse at either the Hawthorne Bridgehead or
the Block 128 sites will be via a sally port. For the Hawthorne Bridgehead site, vehicles will
enter from southbound SW Naito Parkway and exit onto SW Jefferson Street. At Block 128,
vehicles will enter from SW 2nd Avenue and exit onto SW Columbia Street. The sally port is
expected to have four trips per day for secure prisoner transfers. One trip will occur during the
AM peak, two will occur mid-day, and the last trip will be during the PM peak hour. Given the
very low volume, vehicle access at either proposed site is not a concern. Compared to the
existing courthouse where SW 5th Avenue is be closed during prisoner transfers, the sally port
will significantly improve vehicle access by having a secure location off-street to transfer
prisoners which will not require street closures.

11.      FREIGHT LOADING CONSIDERATIONS
The sally port access has been provided for secure prisoner transfers at the new courthouse. It
is possible the County could use the sally port for freight delivery. This option would be further
explored during the design of the site. If the sally port can’t be used for freight, deliveries are
expected to be similar to the existing courthouse. The existing Multnomah County Courthouse
has dedicated a portion of the on-street parking to be for freight delivery between 7 AM and 7
PM. For the Hawthorne Bridgehead site, there is existing freight delivery located along SW
Jefferson Street between 7 AM and 7 PM. For Block 128 there is not existing freight delivery
signed adjacent to the block. There is a freight delivery zone across the street on the west side
of SW 2nd Avenue.

If the sally ports cannot be used for freight loading, the existing loading zone on SW Jefferson
Street at the Hawthorne Bridgehead site could potentially be used, or reconfigured, to
accommodate truck deliveries to the new courthouse. Since the existing loading zone at the
Block 128 site is across the street, it is likely that a new loading zone would have to be
identified for Block 128. In any case, the loading zone will have to be located in a place on-
street that is conducive to the new courthouse building design, which may require new loading
zone locations.

12.      TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS
For the purposes of this Transportation Alternatives Analysis, it is assumed that the contractor
will need to close one lane on multiple block faces adjacent to the proposed sites. The
temporary lane closures present specific issues at each location.

Hawthorne Bridgehead
The Hawthorne Bridgehead is enclosed by SW Madison Street on the north, SW Jefferson Street
on the south, SW 1st Avenue on the west, and SW Naito Parkway on the east. The contractor
would likely close lanes on SW 1st Avenue and SW Jefferson Street. It is unlikely the City of

Transportation Alternatives Analysis Technical Memorandum                                       Final


Portland would permit the contractor to close lanes along SW Madison Street and SW Naito
Parkway during the peak hours, restricting lane closures to the nighttime and midday periods.
Exact hours of closures will need to be coordinated with the City of Portland Bureau of
Transportation and the County will require the Contractor to work with the adjacent building
owner’s to minimize impacts to their on-going operations.

Closing one lane adjacent to the site will interfere with the four one-hour on-street parking
stalls, truck loading zone and bus stop on SW Jefferson Street, but would not result in a loss of
travel lane. Blocking the bus stop and truck loading zones may require trucks and buses to
reroute to temporary transit stops and loading zones for the duration of construction. Lane
closures on SW 1st Avenue would result in the loss of a travel lane during construction.

Construction staging will occur at the North Triangle for lay down/stating areas. It is also
possible the contractor may use the top of the City Garage for lighter materials.

Block 128
The Block 128 site is enclosed by SW Columbia Street on the north, SW Clay Street on the
south, SW 2nd Avenue on the west, and SW 1st Avenue on the east. It is unlikely the City of
Portland would permit the contractor to take lanes along SW Clay Street during the peak hours,
restricting lane closures to the nighttime and midday periods. Exact hours of closures will need
to be coordinated with the City of Portland Bureau of Transportation.

Closing the lanes adjacent to the Block 128 site will interfere with a bus stop on SW Columbia
Street which will require the bus stop to be relocated to a nearby location. Additionally, six two-
hour on-street parking stalls on SW 1st Avenue, and four two-hour on-street parking stalls and
on-street motorcycle parking on SW Clay Street will be affected by temporary lane closures.
The driveway to the existing underground parking and freight loading area located on-site is
also accessed from SW Clay Street and would likely have to be maintained for operations during
construction. Lane closures would result in the loss of a travel lane on SW 2nd Avenue.

Construction staging for this site is to be determined.

There are no significant concerns or differences with construction impacts to traffic at the two
proposed sites.

13.      CONCLUSIONS
The relocated courthouse is not expected to alter downtown traffic patterns or operations
significantly. It is assumed that the trips generated for the new courthouse will be comparable
to the trips generated by the existing courthouse; therefore no net new trips are expected to be
added to the downtown network. Traffic operations for the 2020 opening year volume
forecasts, based on background growth rates, indicate that all study area intersections are
expected to operate within the overall intersection LOS D standard for signalized intersections
and LOS E standard for unsignalized intersections.

Due to the close proximity of the two proposed sites and the availability of off-site parking
around both, travel patterns for commuters and visitors are expected to be similar for both
sites. Adjacent intersections at either location should expect increases in pedestrian and bicycle
crossings which may reduce the vehicular capacity of conflicting turning movements and
increases in delay. The effects of this increased pedestrian and bicycle activity pose unique
challenges for each location, but are not expected to affect the overall traffic operations for any
study area intersections significantly.

Temporary traffic impacts due to construction will require the contractor to block travel lanes
or on-street parking lanes for both locations. The specific impacts are unique to each site, but
may both result in loss of on-street parking, through lane capacity, relocated bus stops, and
time-of-day restrictions for travel lane closures on major roadways.

In summary, the transportation analysis for the two proposed sites does not preclude either
site from consideration as there are no fatal flaws with respect to transportation for either site.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND
The purpose of the “OR213: Cascade Highway North @ Stark & Washington St.” project is
to upgrade the traffic signal and provide access management treatment at the intersections of
Cascade Highway North (OR213, SE 82nd Avenue) with SE Stark Street and SE Washington
Street to improve vehicular and pedestrian safety. The project elements include but not
limited to the following:

    •   Upgrade signal with mast arms/illumination
    •   Replace signal controller cabinet
    •   Install countdown pedestrian heads with audible signal
    •   Install ADA ramps
    •   Install a traffic separator between Stark and Washington Streets
    •   Replace striping
    •   Install pavement markers
    •   Access management
    •   Bike/sidewalk/crosswalk improvements

There was a Road Safety Audit (RSA) conducted at the intersections of SE 82nd Avenue with
SE Stark Street and SE Washington Street. The RSA report prepared by David McDonald,
Graduate Engineer, in June 2012 identified the safety issues and recommended a number of
potential remedies to address the deficiencies at the two study intersections. A copy of the
RSA report is provided in the Appendix. This project incorporates the safety improvements
identified in the RSA report.

1.2 REPORT DESCRIPTION
This report analyzes traffic safety and operations at the intersections of SE 82nd Avenue with
SE Stark Street and SE Washington Street under Existing 2012 Conditions and Future 2034
Conditions. It also includes storage length recommendation, access management, and
preliminary work zone lane restrictions.

2   2012 EXISTING CONDITIONS
The analysis of the existing conditions is based on the data collected in October 2010 at the
intersections of SE 82nd Avenue with SE Stark Street and SE Washington Street under
existing intersection lane configurations and traffic control.

2.1 STUDY AREA
The project covers a 0.19-mile segment on SE 82nd Avenue from approximately 475 feet
north of SE Stark Street (SE Pine Street) to 265 feet south of SE Washington Street (SE
Alder Street). The project is located in the City of Portland. A vicinity map of the project
site is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
2.2.1   Roadway Network
According to the Oregon Highway Plan, OR213 is a designated District highway. The
highway is functionally classified as an “Urban Principal Arterial-Other” in the 2012
Highway Design Manual. The City of Portland designates SE Stark Street and SE
Washington Street as a Major City Traffic Streets east of OR213 and a District Collector on
the west.

Within the project section, OR213 runs north-south. It is a 5-lane roadway with two through
lanes in each direction and a center turn lane. The highway intersects a one-way couplet with
SE Stark Street running westbound from the north and SE Washington Street eastbound to
the south. These two intersections are approximately 250 feet apart and currently under
signal control with crosswalks provided at all four legs of the intersections. There is a
dedicated northbound left turn lane provided on OR213 at SE Stark Street; however, the
southbound left turn movement on OR213 at SE Washington Street is prohibited. Both SE
Stark Street and SE Washington Street are 2-lane roadways with intermittent parking
provided on both sides of the streets. SE Stark Street at its approach with OR213 has a left
turn lane, two though lanes and a right turn lane. SE Washington Street has a left turn lane, a
through lane and a through/right turn lane at its approach with OR213.

Land use in the vicinity of the project area includes a mixture of residential, restaurants, and
various commercial businesses and shopping areas.

2.2.2 Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
There is no bike lane provided on OR213, SE Stark Street or SE Washington Street.
Sidewalk exists on both sides of the street for each roadway. Intermittent parking is provided
on both SE Stark and Washington Streets.

2.2.3 Public Transit
There is daily transit service on the highway provided by Tri-Met Bus Line #72-
Killingsworth/82nd Avenue. Daily transit service on SE Stark Street and SE Washington
Street is provided by Tri-Met Bus Line #15- Belmont/NW 23rd. There are bus stops located
in the vicinity of the two study intersections.

2.3 TRAFFIC SAFETY
2.3.1 Crash History
An analysis of the reported crashes on the Cascade Highway North between M.P. 3.16 and
M.P. 3.35 was performed for the 5-year period from January 1, 2007 through December 31,
2011. Table 2-1 provides a summary of the crashes by type and severity.

 Injury A = Major (bleeding, broken bones, etc.)
 Injury B = Intermediate (bruises, swelling, etc.)
 Injury C = Minor (complaints of pain)


As shown in Table 2-1, there were a total of 80 reported crashes in the 5-year study period.
The most common types of crashes were angle (38%), rear-end (30%) and turning movement
(15%) collisions. The crash data indicated a high number of angle crashes at both
intersections as a result of motorists disregarding the traffic signals. The rear-end crashes
were typical at signalized intersections. The turning movement crashes were related to
drivers making illegal turning maneuvers or improper turns without yielding to other
vehicles. Congestion and long traffic queue could also be attributable to the overall crashes
on OR213 at the intersections.

There were a total of 51 crashes that occurred under dry pavement condition; 28 crashes
occurred under wet pavement condition; and 1 crash occurred under unknown surface
condition. Most of the crashes occurred during daytime hours with 24 crashes occurred at
night.

2.3.2 Crash Severity/Crash Rate
In assessing crash severity, there were: 1 major injury crash, 12 intermediate injury crashes,
25 minor injury crashes and 42 property-damage-only crashes. There was no fatal crash
reported. The major injury crash was an angle collision that occurred at the intersection of
OR213 and SE Washington Street. It involved an eastbound driver on SE Washington Street
who disregarded the traffic signal and collided into a northbound vehicle on OR213. The
driver of the northbound vehicle had major injury as a result.

Due to the short roadway segment within the project limits, an intersection crash rate based
on the number of vehicles entering the intersection instead of vehicle-miles traveled was
calculated. The computed crash rate for the intersection of OR213 at SE Stark Street is 0.71
and SE Washington Street is 0.64 crash per million entering vehicles (MEV). In general, an
intersection with a crash rate greater than 1.0 crash per MEV is generally indicative of a
safety related problem and should be evaluated further.

2.3.3 SPIS Ratings
The Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) is a method developed by ODOT for identifying
high crash locations on state highways based on crash data over a three-year period and is
comprised of three components: crash frequency, crash rate, and crash severity. Based on the
2012 SPIS data, the two intersections are ranked on the top 5% list. This project will
improve the visibility of the intersection by upgrading the signal with mast arms and adding
illumination. The project also provides access management treatment.

2.3.4   SIP Category
The Safety Investment Program (SIP) is a method developed by ODOT to categorize five-
mile roadway sections by a rating ranging from 1 to 5 that is based on the number of fatal
and severe crashes during a three-year period. The following is the stratification for SIP
categories:
    •   Rating 1:   0 fatal or injury A (serious) crashes;
    •   Rating 2:   1 to 2 fatal or injury A crashes;
    •   Rating 3:   3 to 5 fatal or injury A crashes;
    •   Rating 4:   6 to 9 fatal or injury A crashes;
    •   Rating 5:   10 or more fatal or injury A crashes.

According to the 2012 SIP list, the project section has a SIP Category 5.

2.4 POSTED SPEED
The posted speeds on SE 82nd Avenue, SE Stark Street and SE Washington Street are:

    •   SE 82nd Avenue (OR213): 35 MPH
    •   SE Stark and Washington Streets: 30 MPH

2.5.2 Intersection Counts
Existing weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour turning movement counts were collected in
October 2010 at the two study intersections. 24-hr directional hourly volumes collected in
April 2012 on OR213 and SE Stark Street were obtained from the Traffic Count
Management (TCM) database. Traffic count on SE Washington Street was not available
from the TCM.

The weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours for the intersections were determined to occur from
7:55 a.m. to 8:55 a.m. and from 4:35 p.m. to 5:35 p.m., respectively. Due to the economic
downturn and high rise in the gas prices, there was little or no growth in the area. The 2010
turning movement counts represent the existing 2012 volumes. Traffic volumes were
rounded to the nearest five vehicles. There was high pedestrian activity observed in the a.m.
and p.m. peak hours. The 2012 weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes with the
existing lane configuration are presented in Figure 2.

2.6 INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
2.6.1 Intersection Traffic Control
The signalized intersections of SE 82nd Avenue at SE Stark and Washington Streets are
operated in a coordinated system and maintained by the City of Portland for ODOT per
Interagency Agreement.

2.6.2 Traffic Operations Analysis Methodology
The traffic study utilizes Synchro/SimTraffic for analyzing the study intersections under
existing year 2012 conditions and future year 2034 conditions.

A measure of effectiveness referred to as “control delay” is used to determine the level of
service (LOS), which is a standardized scale used to describe the performance at signalized
intersections. The LOS rating ranges from “A” to “F”, with LOS “A” representing the best
operation and LOS “F” representing the poorest operation. Table 2-2 provides the level of
service criteria for signalized intersections.

2.6.3 Analysis Results
An operational analysis of the 2012 Existing Conditions was performed for the study
intersections. Table 2-3 provides the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratios, average control delay,
and resulting LOS for the study intersections under existing conditions.

3   2034 FUTURE CONDITIONS
3.1 TRAFFIC VOLUME FORECAST
In determining future year 2034 volumes for the project section, the following sources were
examined:
        •    City of Portland Transportation System Plan
        •    Metro’s Regional Travel Demand Model
        •    Historical traffic growth trend on OR213 in the study area

After reviewing these sources, the Metro’s 2035 Regional Travel Demand Model was
utilized to forecast future 2034 volumes at the intersections of OR213 with SE Stark Street
and SE Washington Street. The design year 2034 a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes
and lane configuration are shown in Figure 3.

The analysis evaluates the intersection operations under two scenarios: (1) existing signal
timing and (2) with signal optimization timing in which the intersection splits will be set
automatically for all phases based on traffic demand.

As shown, the study intersections would operate at LOS “E” or better in both peak periods
with a v/c ratio of 0.99 in the p.m. peak hour at the intersection of OR213 with SE
Washington Street. This is due to the increase in volumes within the project area in addition
to congestion and long traffic queue. Also, the analysis indicates no significant differences in
traffic performance (v/c ratios) under either scenario, except for the delay which would be
improved, particularly in the a.m. peak hour at the Stark St. intersection. There are other
potential improvements that could be made to lower the v/c ratio and improve the
intersection operations, but they are beyond the scope of the project.

3.3 STORAGE LENGTH RECOMMENDATIONS
SimTraffic was used to analyze queuing for the design year 2034 to determine the storage
length needed for the turn lanes on OR213 at the study intersections. Table 3-2 lists the
recommended storage lengths for the turn lanes.

    Table 3-2: Storage Length Recommendations
                                                                                    Storage Length
    Intersection                 Roadway              Approach Turn Lane
                                                                                         (feet)
                                 OR213             Northbound Left Turn Lane              175
    OR213 @ SE Stark Street                        Westbound Left Turn Lane               300
                                 SE Stark St
                                                   Westbound Right turn Lane              300
    OR213 @ SE Washington St     Washington St     Eastbound Left Turn Lane               300

It should be noted that the Striping Plan Designer will need to determine if lengthening the
existing turn lanes on OR213, SE Stark Street and SE Washington Street would be practical,
as they may conflict with the ingress or egress movements to/from business accesses. If they
could not be accommodated, the existing storage length for the turn lanes should be
maintained as currently striped or extended as long as possible without impacting the
driveway accesses.

4     ACCESS MANAGEMENT
There are many driveway accesses on OR213 within the project section that are closely
spaced. Closing, consolidating or converting the accesses to a right-in/right-out to enhance
traffic and pedestrian safety at the study intersections should be considered. An access
management subteam should be convened early in the project development process to
address access management issues associated with the project design.

5     PRELIMINARY WORK ZONE RESTRICTIONS
The preliminary recommendations on lane restrictions are shown below. They are subject to
change and an update will be necessary through the development of the Traffic Control Plan
and Project Special Provisions during Advance and Final PS&E. The lane restrictions in the
Special Provisions will take precedence over these preliminary lane restrictions in this traffic
report.

OR-213 Cascade Highway Mini-ROAD SAFETY AUDIT
SE 82nd Ave @ SE Stark St. and SE Washington St.
Mile Point 3.16 – 3.35
Audit Date: June 20th, 2012
Road Safety Audit (RSA)

  Background:

  The RSA Team met on Wednesday June 20, 2012 at the ODOT Region 1 Headquarters in
  Portland. The RSA investigation limits were predefined for this RSA to be between mile points
  3.16 and 3.35 on Cascade Highway OR-213(82nd Ave). These mile points correspond to the
  portion of OR-213 approximately 500ft north and south of the intersections of SE Stark St. and
  SE Washington St. Within the study area, 82nd Ave has a 5-lane cross section with two lanes
  in each direction and a center turning lane. Cascade Highway in the area has a 2011 Average
  Daily Traffic (ADT) of approximately 26,000 vehicles per day with a posted speed limit of 35
  mph. 82nd Ave and the cross streets of SE Stark and SE Washington are classified as major
  arterials for the City of Portland and are shown to have minimal heavy truck traffic. The
  morning peak hour at the intersections occurs from 7:00am to 8:00am with the evening peak
  hour occurring between 4:00pm and 5:00pm.

  The purpose of the RSA is to conduct a safety evaluation of the roadway infrastructure,
  intersection, signing, pavement markings, traffic operations, and all necessary incidental items
  associated with the intersection improvement. The intent is to identify what potential elements
  of the roadway may present a safety concern: to what extent, to which road users, and under
  what circumstances. The team then collaborates to determine what opportunities may exist to
  eliminate or mitigate these identified safety concerns.

  The RSA location was selected because it is listed as a top 5% potential safety improvements
  site in the 2011 State Safety Priority Index System (SPIS). Accident history at the intersection
  is mostly related to right angle, rear-end, and turning movement crashes. The signal equipment
  and infrastructure are old and in need of updating. Due to the number of crashes at the
  intersection, this location was selected as a safety improvement project site in the Statewide
  Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). The intersection is in the planning stages of
  development.

  Project Scope:
  Upgrade intersection; new signals, loops, controllers and base meter cabinet. Access
  management may include installation of median traffic separators on SE 82nd Avenue and
  assessment of the number, size and location of driveway entrances on SE 82nd Avenue.
  Foundation work will be needed for the new signal poles and luminaries. ADA/pedestrian
  facility improvements and utility relocations are also included in the scope.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND
The purpose of the “OR213: Cascade Highway North @ Division St” project is to upgrade
the traffic signal and provide access management treatment at the intersection of Cascade
Highway North (OR213, SE 82nd Avenue) and SE Division Street to improve vehicular and
pedestrian safety. The project elements include but not limited to the following:

    •   Upgrade signal with mast arms/illumination
    •   Replace signal controller cabinet
    •   Install countdown pedestrian heads with audible signal
    •   Install detector loops
    •   Install ADA ramps
    •   Replace striping/signing
    •   Install pavement markers
    •   Access management
    •   Bike and sidewalk improvements

There was a Road Safety Audit (RSA) conducted at the intersection of SE 82nd Avenue and
SE Division Street. The RSA report prepared by David McDonald, Graduate Engineer, in
May 2012 identified the safety issues and recommended a number of potential remedies to
address the deficiencies at the study intersection. A copy of the RSA report is provided in
the Appendix. This project incorporates the safety improvements identified in the RSA
report.

1.2 REPORT DESCRIPTION
This report analyzes traffic safety and operations at the intersection of SE 82nd Avenue and
SE Division Street under Existing 2012 Conditions and Future 2034 Conditions. It also
includes storage length recommendations, access management, and preliminary work zone
lane restrictions.

2   2012 EXISTING CONDITIONS
The analysis of the existing conditions is based on the data collected in October 2010 at the
intersection of SE 82nd Avenue and SE Division Street with existing intersection lane
configurations and traffic control.

2.1 STUDY AREA
The project covers a 0.27-mile segment on SE 82nd Avenue, approximately 1,000 feet north
and south of the intersection with SE Division Street. The project is located in the City of
Portland. A vicinity map of the project site is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
2.2.1   Roadway Network
According to the Oregon Highway Plan, OR213 is a designated District highway. The
highway is functionally classified as an “Urban Principal Arterial-Other” in the 2012
Highway Design Manual. The City of Portland designates SE Division Street as a
Neighborhood Collector west of SE 82nd Avenue and a District Collector to the east.

OR213 runs north-south and Division Street east-west. Both roadways have two through
lanes and a dedicated left turn lane in each direction. Division Street also has a dedicated
right turn lane on both of its approaches to OR213. The study intersection is signalized with
crosswalks provided on all four legs of the intersection.

Land use in the project area includes a mixture of residential, restaurants, and various
commercial businesses along OR213 and Division Street.

2.2.2 Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
There are bike lanes provided on Division Street but not on OR213. Sidewalk exists on both
sides of the street for each roadway, except on the east side of OR213 from Division Street to
approximately 450 feet to the north. This section has open frontage accesses with a number
of parking spaces abutting the highway.

2.2.3 Public Transit
There is daily transit service on OR213 provided by Tri-Met Bus Line #72-
Killingsworth/82nd Ave. Daily transit service on SE Division Street is provided by Tri-Met
Bus Line #4- Division/Fessenden. There are bus stops located at the study intersection.

2.3 TRAFFIC SAFETY
2.3.1 Crash History
An analysis of the reported crashes on the Cascade Highway North between M.P. 4.15 and
M.P. 4.42 was performed for the 5-year period from January 1, 2007 through December 31,
2011. Table 2-1 provides a summary of the crashes by type and severity.

 Injury A = Major (bleeding, broken bones, etc.)
 Injury B = Intermediate (bruises, swelling, etc.)
 Injury C = Minor (complaints of pain)


As shown in Table 2-1, there were a total of 128 reported crashes in the 5-year study period.
The most common types of crashes were rear-end (59%) and turning movement (27%)
collisions. The rear-end crashes were attributed to motorists following too close and unable
to stop when a vehicle in front made a sudden stop. This type of crash is typical at signalized
intersections. The turning movement crashes were related to drivers making illegal turning
maneuvers or improper turns without yielding to other vehicles on the highway. These
crashes often related to traffic turning from/to SE 82nd Avenue onto SE Division Street or
from/to the business accesses along the highway. Congestion and long traffic queue could be
attributable to the overall crashes at the intersection as well.

There were a total of 90 crashes that occurred under dry pavement condition; 28 crashes
occurred under wet pavement condition; 1 crash occurred under snow pavement condition
and 9 crashes occurred under unknown surface condition. Most of the crashes occurred
during daytime hours with 16 crashes occurred at night.

2.3.2 Crash Severity/Crash Rate
In assessing crash severity, there were: 5 major injury crashes, 11 intermediate injury
crashes, 55 minor injury crashes and 57 property-damage-only crashes. There was no fatal
crash reported. A detailed description of each major injury crashes is described below.

    •   A pedestrian crash that occurred at approximately 370 feet north of the study
        intersection, M.P. 4.17 – It involved a southbound vehicle colliding into a pedestrian
        who was crossing SE 82nd Avenue eastbound.
    •   A fixed-object crash that occurred at approximately 100 feet north of the study
        intersection, M.P. 4.22 – It involved a northbound driver who felt asleep at the wheel
        and collided into a utility pole.
    •   A pedestrian crash that occurred at the study intersection, M.P. 4.24 – It involved a
        northbound vehicle colliding into a pedestrian crossing eastbound using the south
        crosswalk. The crash report indicated both the driver and pedestrian disregarded the
        traffic signal.
    •   A non-collision crash that occurred at the study intersection, M.P. 4.24 – It involved a
        northbound motorcyclist who was traveling too fast for the roadway condition while
        making a right turn and lost control of the vehicle.
    •   A rear-end crash that occurred at approximately 50 feet south of the study
        intersection, M.P. 4.25 – It involved a northbound motorist who was following too
        close and unable to stop when a vehicle in front made a sudden stop.

Due to the short roadway segment within the project limits, an intersection crash rate
(crashes within 250 feet of the intersection) based on the number of vehicles entering the
intersection instead of vehicle-miles traveled was calculated. The computed crash rate at the
intersection of OR213 and SE Division Street is 1.50 crashes per million entering vehicles
(MEV). In general, an intersection with a crash rate greater than 1.0 crash per MEV is
generally indicative of a safety related problem and should be evaluated further.

2.3.3 SPIS Ratings
The Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) is a method developed by ODOT for identifying
high crash locations on state highways based on crash data over a three-year period and is
comprised of three components: crash frequency, crash rate, and crash severity. Based on the
2012 SPIS data, the intersection of SE 82nd Avenue at SE Division Street is ranked on the top
5% list.

2.3.4   SIP Category
The Safety Investment Program (SIP) is a method developed by ODOT to categorize five-
mile roadway sections by a rating ranging from 1 to 5 that is based on the number of fatal
and severe crashes during a three-year period. The following is the stratification for SIP
categories:
    •   Rating 1:   0 fatal or injury A (serious) crashes;
    •   Rating 2:   1 to 2 fatal or injury A crashes;
    •   Rating 3:   3 to 5 fatal or injury A crashes;
    •   Rating 4:   6 to 9 fatal or injury A crashes;
    •   Rating 5:   10 or more fatal or injury A crashes.

According to the 2012 SIP list, the project section has a SIP Category 5.

2.4 POSTED SPEED
The posted speed on SE 82nd Avenue and SE Division Street is 35 MPH.

2.5 TRAFFIC VOLUMES
2.5.1 Daily Traffic and Truck Percentage
The existing 2011 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volume on OR213 is 24,600
vehicles with trucks accounting for 5.5% of the traffic. The projected future year 2034
AADT on OR213 is 32,000 vehicles. SE Division Street has an existing 2011 AADT of
22,100 vehicles.

2.5.2 Intersection Counts
Existing weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour turning movement counts were collected in
October 2010 at the intersection of SE 82nd Avenue and SE Division Street. 24-hr bi-
directional counts collected in April 2012 on OR213 (north and south of Division Street) and
November 2011 on Division Street (located just east 89th Avenue) were obtained from the
Traffic Count Management Database.

The weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours at the intersection were determined to occur from
8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., respectively. Due to the economic
downturn and high rise in the gas prices, there was little or no growth in the area; thus, the
2010 turning movement counts represent the existing 2012 volumes. Traffic volumes were
rounded to the nearest five vehicles. There was high pedestrian activity observed in the a.m.
and p.m. peak hours at all four legs of the intersection. The 2012 weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hour traffic volumes with the existing lane configuration are presented in Figure 2.

2.6 INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
2.6.1 Intersection Traffic Control
The signalized intersection of SE 82nd Avenue at SE Division Street is operated and
maintained by the City of Portland for ODOT per Interagency Agreement.

2.6.2 Traffic Operations Analysis Methodology
The traffic study utilizes Synchro/SimTraffic for analyzing the study intersections under
existing year 2012 conditions and future year 2034 conditions.

A measure of effectiveness referred to as “control delay” is used to determine the level of
service (LOS), which is a standardized scale used to describe the performance at signalized
intersections. The LOS rating ranges from “A” to “F”, with LOS “A” representing the best
operation and LOS “F” representing the poorest operation. Table 2-2 provides the level of
service criteria for signalized intersections.

2.6.3 Analysis Results
An operational analysis of the 2012 Existing Conditions was performed for the study
intersection. Table 2-3 provides the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratios, average control delay,
and resulting LOS for the study intersection under the existing conditions based on current
signal timing.

As shown in Table 2-3, the study intersection currently operates over capacity with a v/c ratio
over one in the weekday p.m. peak hour. The high v/c is based on the way the signal is timed

where the southbound through movement was allocated with a shorter green time in order to
facilitate the northbound through movement on SE 82nd Avenue. In addition, it is also due to
congestion with long traffic queue as well as the lack of separate northbound and southbound
right turn lanes on the highway.

3   2034 FUTURE CONDITIONS
3.1 TRAFFIC VOLUME FORECAST
In determining future year 2034 volumes for the intersection of SE 82nd Avenue at SE
Division Street, the following sources were examined:
        •    City of Portland Transportation System Plan
        •    Metro’s Regional Travel Demand Model
        •    Historical traffic growth trend on OR213 in the study area

After reviewing these sources, the Metro’s 2035 Regional Travel Demand Model was
utilized to forecast future 2034 volumes at the intersection. The design year 2034 a.m. and
p.m. peak hour traffic volumes and lane configuration are shown in Figure 3.

3.2 INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
The analysis evaluates the intersection operations under two scenarios: (1) existing signal
timing and (2) with signal optimization timing in which the intersection splits will be set
automatically for all phases based on traffic demand.

 * V/C, Delay and LOS are based on Synchro HCM summary report for signalized intersection.


As shown, under existing signal timing the study intersection would operate at LOS “E” in
the a.m. peak hour and at LOS “F” with a v/c ratio of 1.29 in the p.m. peak hour. The
analysis also indicates that with signal optimization timing, the intersection would improve to
operate at LOS “E” or better in the a.m. and p.m. peak hours and with a v/c ratio of 1.09 in
the p.m. peak hour. There are other improvements that could be made to improve the
intersection operation, but they are beyond the scope of the project.

3.3 STORAGE LENGTH RECOMMENDATION
SimTraffic was used to analyze queuing for the design year 2034 to determine the storage
length needed for the turn lanes on OR213 at SE Division Street. Table 3-2 lists the
recommended storage lengths for the turn lanes.

It should be noted that the Striping Plan Designer will need to determine if lengthening the
existing turn lanes on OR213 and Division Street would be practical, as they may conflict
with the ingress or egress movements to/from business accesses. If they cannot be
accommodated, the existing storage length for the turn lanes should be maintained as
currently striped or extended as long as possible without impacting the driveway accesses.

4    ACCESS MANAGEMENT
There are many driveway accesses on OR213 that are closely spaced. Closing, consolidating
or converting the accesses to a right-in/right-out to enhance traffic and pedestrian safety at
the study intersection should be considered. An access management subteam should be

OR-213 Cascade Highway Mini-ROAD SAFETY AUDIT
SE 82nd Ave @ SE Division St
Mile Point 4.15 – 4.42
Audit Date: May 23-24, 2012
Road Safety Audit (RSA)
  Background:
  The RSA Team met on Wednesday May 23 and 24, 2012 at the ODOT Region 1 Headquarters
  in Portland. The RSA study limits were predefined to be from the approximate mile points 4.15
  to 4.42 on OR-213(82nd Ave). This corresponds to the portion of OR-213 approximately 1000ft
  north and south of the intersection with SE Division Street. Within the study area, 82nd Ave
  has a 5-lane cross section with two lanes in each direction and a center turning lane. Cascade
  Highway in the area has a 2011 Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volume of approximately 26,000
  vehicles per day. The posted speed limit through this section of highway is 35mph. 82nd Ave
  and Division St are both classified as major arterials serving the City of Portland and have
  minimal heavy truck traffic. The morning peak hour at the intersection occurs from 7:00am to
  8:00am. The evening peak hour occurs from 4:00pm to 5:00pm.

  The purpose of the RSA is to conduct a safety evaluation of the roadway infrastructure,
  intersection, signing, pavement markings, traffic operations, and all necessary incidental items
  associated with the intersection improvement. The intent is to identify what potential elements
  of the roadway may present a safety concern: to what extent, to which road users, and under
  what circumstances. The team then collaborates to determine what opportunities may exist to
  eliminate or mitigate the identified safety concerns.

  The RSA location was selected because it is listed as a top 5% site for potential safety
  improvements in the 2011 State Safety Priority Index System (SPIS). Accident history at the
  intersection is mostly related to rear-end collisions, turning movement collisions, and
  pedestrian/bicycle vehicle interaction. The signal equipment and signal controllers are old and
  in need of updating. Due to the number of crashes at the intersection, this location was selected
  as a safety improvement project site in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program
  (STIP). The intersection is in the planning stages of development.

  STIP Project Scope:
  Upgrade intersection; new signals, loops, controllers and base meter cabinet. Access
  management may include installation of median traffic separators on SE 82nd Avenue and
  assessment of the number, size and location of driveway entrances on SE 82nd Avenue.
  Foundation work will be needed for the new signal poles. Luminaries will also be needed with
  select signal poles as determined by the signal designer. ADA upgrades/pedestrian
  improvements and utility relocations are also included in the scope.

Road Safety Audit – OR 213 (82nd Avenue) and E. Burnside Street

Background:

The signalized intersection of 82nd Avenue and E. Burnside Street in southeast Portland
between mile points 2.99 and 3.02 is listed as top 5% Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) site
and top 5% pedestrian/bike SPIS and therefore identified by ODOT as a potential Fix-it
project in the 2016-2018 Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).

As part of the scoping process, a multi-disciplinary and multi-jurisdictional team conducted a
Road Safety Audit (RSA) on Thursday August 15, 2013 with the purpose of assessing the
safety performance of this intersection. This safety performance assessment will be used as a
tool to prioritize improvements in the proposed Fix-it Project. Some of the factors that were
evaluated in the RSA include roadway and intersection infrastructure, signing and pavement
markings, traffic and bus operations, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, roadside elements, and
driver behavior. The findings are summarized in the Table below which identifies all
potential safety concerns and lists possible improvements to enhance safety for all users.

82nd Avenue is a five-lane urban principal arterial that accommodates an Annual Average
Daily Traffic (AADT) of 25,100 vehicles with 5 percent truck volume. E. Burnside Street
consists of a two-lane roadway plus a bike lane in each direction and accommodates an
AADT of 8,900 vehicles. The posted speed limit is 35 mph on both 82nd Avenue and E.
Burnside Street. At the signalized intersection with 82nd Avenue, E. Burnside Street is
marked with a shared through and right lane and an exclusive left-turn lane in each direction.
The painted bike lane along E. Burnside Street is discontinued from a location west of 82nd
Avenue to 83rd Avenue to accommodate the turn lanes. Bus lines 20 and 72 serve transit
users on E. Burnside St and on 82nd Avenue, respectively. Bus stops are located at the near
side of each of the four corners of the intersection with significant ridership ranging from 156
to 297 average daily boardings. Currently, the traffic signal operates on a lead-lag left-turn
sequence for the northbound and southbound phases, respectively, followed by an east-west
phase. Countdown pedestrian signals are provided and operate in recall mode.

Crash history in the last five-year period from 1/1/2008 to 12/31/2012 indicate that 48 crashes
occurred at this location with one crash resulting in life-threatening injuries (Injury A).
Patterns of rear end crashes were identified in the northbound and southbound directions.
Other common crash types were right angle and left-turn crashes. A number of crashes were
associated with vehicles entering or exiting driveways particularly in the south leg of the
intersection. Some of contributing factors identified in the crash history include failed to
yield the right-of-way, following too closely and improper lane changes. Two pedestrian
crashes were recorded in the five-year period and were attributed to pedestrian disregarding
the traffic signal or failing to yield the right of way. A high crash frequency was identified in
the afternoon peak period from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.

Project Scope: Full signal upgrade, intersection sight distance improvements, illumination
improvements, ADA improvements, access management

SUBJECT:        K16150 – ODOT OR213 Intersection Improvements Traffic Analysis                           P#14132-000



1 INTRODUCTION
This memorandum provides the results of the transportation analysis of the existing and future conditions for
three of the six proposed traffic signal replacements for the ODOT OR213 Intersection Improvements, Couch to
Division project. Although the project includes traffic signal replacement at six intersections, ODOT has already
completed traffic analysis for three of the intersections 1. This analysis evaluates potential short-term
improvements and provides documentation to support signal approval requests.

1.1 Purpose and Background
The purpose of the ODOT OR213 Intersection Improvements, Couch to Division project is to improve
intersection safety and operations by replacing the outdated traffic signal equipment with new traffic signals
and appurtenances at the intersections of Cascade Highway North (OR213, NE/SE 82nd Avenue) with E Burnside
Street, SE Yamhill Street, and SE Mill Street. The project elements include, but are not limited to, the following:
    • Upgrading signals with mast arms/illumination
    • Replacing signal controller cabinets (including controller)
    • Installing countdown pedestrian heads with audible signals
    • Installing ADA ramps

1.2 Study Area
The three project study intersections included in this analysis are shown in Figure 1-1 along with existing traffic
volumes and lane configurations.

Table 2-2 shows a total of 175 reported collisions in the 5-year study period. There were a total of 127 collisions
that occurred under dry surface conditions; 43 collisions occurred under wet surface conditions; 5 under
unknown surface conditions; 122 collisions occurred during daylight hours; and 53 collisions occurred at night.

There was a single fatal collision, three major injury collisions, 30 intermediate injury collisions, 116 minor injury
collisions, and 83 property damage only collisions. The fatal collision involved a pedestrian crossing OR213 from
east to west on SE Mill Street and a vehicle making a right turn movement from east to north. The collision
happened on a cloudy day, with unknown surface conditions, and during daylight hours.

Two of the major injury collisions also happened at the intersection of OR213 and SE Mill Street. The first
involved a pedestrian crossing OR213 from east to west and a vehicle passing through the intersection from
north to south. The collision happened on a cloudy day, with dry surface conditions, and during daylight hours.
The second was an angle collision involving a vehicle passing through the intersection from north to south and a
vehicle passing through the intersection from east to west. The collision happened on a rainy day, with wet
surface conditions, and during daylight hours.

The third major injury collision happened at the intersection of OR213 and E Burnside Street. This collision
involved a pedestrian crossing OR213 from south to north and a vehicle making a right turn movement from
west to south. The collision happened on a rainy day, with wet pavement conditions, and during daylight hours.

Figure 2-1 shows a breakdown of the collisions by intersection and collision type. There were 117 collisions at
the intersection of OR123/E Burnside Street, 29 collisions that occurred at the intersection of OR213/SE Yamhill
Street and 29 collisions that occurred at the intersection of OR213/SE Mill Street as well.

                              Figure 2-1: 5-Year (2009-2013) Traffic Collision Summary by Type

The most common type of collisions for the intersections of OR213/E Burnside Street and SE Mill Street were
rear-end collisions (42.7% and 41.4%, respectively). The intersection of OR213/SE Mill Street shows a high
percentage of collisions involving pedestrians (10.3%); this intersection was the site of the lone fatal collision in
the project area, which involved a pedestrian.

2.2.2 Collision Rate
A crash rate analysis was conducted based on the number of vehicles entering the intersections. The computed
crash rate for the intersection of OR213 at E Burnside Street is 3.24, SE Yamhill Street is 1.02, and SE Mill Street
is 1.08 collisions per million entering vehicles (MEV). A crash rate greater than 1.0 collisions per MEV is typically
indicative of a safety related problem and should be investigated further.

2.2.3 SPIS Ratings
The Safety Priority Index System (SPIS) is a method developed by ODOT for identifying high crash locations on
state highways based on collision data over a three-year period and is comprised of three components: collision
frequency, collision rate, and collision severity. Based on the 2012 SPIS data, the three study intersections are
ranked on the top 10% SPIS list.

2.3 Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour turning movement counts were collected in July 2014 at the three
study intersections. The weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours for the intersections were determined to occur from
7:40 a.m. to 8:40 a.m. and from 4:35 p.m. to 5:35 p.m., respectively. Figure 1-1 shows the existing weekday a.m.
and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes with the existing lane configurations. The traffic count data is included in
Appendix A.

2.4 Intersection Operations
The traffic operations analysis utilized Synchro/SimTraffic for evaluating the study intersections under Existing
2014 Conditions and Future 2034 Conditions.

Level of service (LOS) and volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios are two commonly used performance measures that
provide a gauge of intersection operations. Descriptions are given below:
    • Level of service (LOS): A “report card” rating (A through F) based on the average delay experienced by
        vehicles at the intersection. LOS A, B, and C indicate conditions where traffic moves without significant
        delays over periods of peak hour travel demand. LOS D and E are progressively worse operating
        conditions. LOS F represents conditions where average vehicle delay has become excessive and demand
        has exceeded capacity. This condition is typically evident in long queues and delays for motor vehicles.
    • Volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio: A decimal representation (between 0.00 and 1.00) of the proportion of
        capacity that is being used (i.e., the saturation) at a turn movement, approach leg, or intersection. It is
        determined by dividing the peak hour traffic volume by the hourly capacity of a given intersection or
        movement. A lower ratio indicates smooth operations and minimal delays. As the ratio approaches 1.00,
        congestion increases and performance is reduced. If the ratio is greater than 1.00, the turn movement,
        approach leg, or intersection is oversaturated and usually results in excessive queues and long delays.

The existing traffic operating conditions at the study intersections were determined for the a.m. and p.m. peak
hours based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology 4 for signalized intersections. Estimated
average delay, level of service (LOS), and volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio for the study intersections are shown in
Table 2-3. Detailed analysis output is included in Appendix B.

Table 2-3 shows the study intersections operate at LOS “C” or better in both peak periods, with a V/C ratio of
0.75 or better. These conditions meet operating standards provided in Chapter 10 of the ODOT Highway Design
Manual.

2.5 Vehicle Queuing
A simulation of existing vehicle queuing was performed using SimTraffic software. The results of the simulation,
illustrated in Table 2-4, provide estimates of vehicle queue lengths for each left turn lane during the a.m. and
